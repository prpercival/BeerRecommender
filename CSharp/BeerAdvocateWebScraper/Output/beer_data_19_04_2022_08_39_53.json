(As I scratch my head.)","  rDev Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It's undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it's a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can't be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There's so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that's not enough for the taste buds to discern, there's some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors. An amazing mouthfeel for such an ABV, this may be the world's best stout.","  rDev Ah yes, breakfast with the baby....this is the first stout I really appreciated. Once I started letting it warm a bit from fridge temp it really blossomed. It's also a best buy at $9.99 a 4-pack.","  rDev Drinking this at home on Christmas Eve. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, a nice tan foamy head that dropped to a thin ring. Appears dark brown almost black with a tannish foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap and nice lacing. Smells biscuity, malty sweet, chocolatey, and roasted dark coffee. Taste follows the nose sublimely. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall a very nice coffee chocolate oatmeal stout that I would definitely order again. Cheers!","  rDev 12oz bottled 8-6-20, opened 10-25-20. 2-finger creamy tan head, pillow-y and with great staying power.  Black with a reddish-brown edge at the bottom. Thick, sticky lacing. Dark chocolate, strong coffee. Strong roast aromas from coffee and malts.  Coffee up front, strong flavor at this point in a  young  FBS...espresso-like strength. Chocolate syrup - the stir in kind. Bit of a metallic twinge in the nose that hasn't blown all the way off half-way through.  Lots of bold, bitter, roasted, and tasty flavors. Full body and smooth mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation.  Lengthy, bittersweet finish. Outstanding.","  rDev Generous 16oz pour at the local slumhouse  A meal in a cup. Black, thin sticky mocha head. Smells and tastes like them beans. Heavy and bitter, blasting your tastebuds away with melted chocolate bars, fresh wet hops and mocha joe style corna' sto' coffee.. but good.  Tastes good and gets you drunk","  rDev Bottled 1/8/20  Almost pitch black pour with a finger of frothy mocha head that quickly reduces to a ring, almost no lacing  Heavy roasted coffee in the nose, rich and full backed up by chocolate notes, sweet and decadent without being overbearing, smells like a good time  The coffee is more bitter in the taste, going a bit too far on the roast, but there’s still mild vanilla notes with a bit of dark fruit  Mild carbonation and a full body, this finishes an odd combo of sweet and bitter, but it’s definitely smooth from the oatmeal  Overall this was good, but it doesn’t live up to the hype. Damn passable, but I wasn’t expecting the coffee to be so bitter. Nonetheless, I’ll come back around to this one and at least it’s better than my first oatmeal stout I had just last week, that one was harsh","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a customer taster pint; bottled 8/29/19. A: Pours a black color with about a one finger, light brown head, more than rim retention, and camouflage shaped lacing. Tiny bubbles appreciable. S: Aromas of dark chocolate, lactose, honey, molasses, plum, and dark roasted coffee. T: Semisweet than sweet. Flavors follow the nose and work together well, but are enhanced and offset by licorice, star anise, and white pepper. Bitterness solid and provides strong counterpoise to the sweetness. M: Full bodied with moderate effervescence. O: Picked this up at the Founders Brewing Company. Reminded me of a blend of breakfast stout and a foreign extra. Just delicious.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a tiny light brown head. Smells of coffee, very strongly. Tastes of coffee with slight chocolate, very creamy. Beer is full bodied yet easier to drink than it should be, decent carbonation. Overall, a superb beer.","  rDev L: Jet black color, two finger brown head, excellent lacing, no visible carbonation.  S: Sweet, chocolate. Smells wonderful!  T: Chocolate, coffee, sweet on the front end, some bitterness on the back end. Nice and balanced.  F: Medium bodied, quite smooth.  O: Very good stout, somewhere in the verge between stout and imperial stout.","  rDev L: Dark brown to black, with a mocha head fading down to a gentle cap and lines of lace.  S: Robust coffee, dark roasted malts and chocolate, slight toffee sweetness.  T: Follows the nose with molasses and leather notes.  F: Full body, good carbonation, oaty smooth.  O: A classic and top notch imperial stout.","  rDev Black color with a rapidly dissipating tan head. Rich coffee and chocolate aroma. Chocolate taste up front, followed by dark roast coffee. Very rich, drinks well as your morning coffee.","  On tap at Yard House Fresno  A: Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a creamy cocoa brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some nice lacing.   S: Bold coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate, earthy, a little pine, peppery spice, molasses, and a little toffee sweetness.  T: Roadted malt, bold but smooth almost espresso like coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, peppery spice, a touch of pine, earthy faintly herbal notes, the slightest hint of dark fruit, molasses, and a little toffee sweetness.   M: Full body, moderate carbonation, creamy smooth. Wonderful.  O: Had my fair share of this stuff over the years, but somehow haven't rated it until now. So we'll balanced, it's about as good as it gets for a straight imperial stout.","  rDev I am frankly incredulous that I have not previously reviewed &amp; rated this beer! How did I allow it to pass me by for so long? I sought this one out even though it only comes in a Bottle while I am trying to eradicate my backlog. That is indicative of how important it is to me to get this one in.   From the Bottle:  Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout ;  60 IBUs ;  The coffee lover's consummate beer. Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and imported chocolates, and two types of coffee, this Stout has an intense fresh-roasted java nose topped with a frothy, cinnamon-colored head that goes forever.   I began by Pop!ping the cap &amp; knowing that it was a very fresh bottle, I proceeded with a C-Line pour. Man, it came up quickly with a pseudo-cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with excellent retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like my morning coffee - a mélange of deeply roasted beans from different locales that I blend together each day &amp; fill the basket to the point that the water has to be coaxed through the filter. Rich, strong coffee with hints of chocolate &amp; smoke. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thick, full, rich &amp; creamy, like a dollop of coffee-chocolate ice cream had been scooped onto my tongue. Mmm. The taste was at once chocolaty and coffee-like with a hint of smoke. Mmm. I have had this many times over, but always out in town, where I rarely do field reviews any more. It is always a treat, just like it was tonight. Loads of lacing formed as I drank through the beer, savoring every sip. I guess that I have taken it for granted in the past since my time with it for this review makes me feel like a born-again virgin. It was like I had never experienced it before, while I know that such was not the case. Finish was more chocolaty than coffee, so I am going to say that it was semi-sweet, but if you want to go with semi-dry, I am not going to put up much of a fight. This was a truly enjoyable experience.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet Kvadrat. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head, not the best retention. Strong and intense aroma of fine coffee and dark chocolate. The flavour is full of coffee, with dark chocolate and oats in the background. Pretty good.","  rDev I feel so lucky to live in a city where a beer of this caliber can be found on the shelves of any nearby supermarket or wine/liquor store...and if I want to head down to Founders’ actual brewery it’s only a ten minute drive. I actually enjoyed this beer almost as much as the KBS, quite possibly because it wasn’t as hyped (and perhaps my expectations were much higher for the KBS). Nice deep rich black color, scant head with nice lingering lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee, tastes even better. Nice notes of coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, some malt and molasses. Very faint alcohol taste, which is also present in the lingering finish. Great mouthfeel, quite smooth and not too thin. Mild carbonation throughout. A pleasure to sip and savor.","  rDev Black with three fingers of tan head. Looks like a chocolate milkshake. Good amount of lacing. Smell is mostly rich coffee. Taste is rich dark roasted coffee with a bit of tasty chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. The finish is semi dry and balanced. Overall a tasty and pleasant Imperial Stout.","  rDev Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smells intensely of roasted malts and coffee, with a certain dark chocolate aroma and just a hint of spiceyness: nutmeg, cinnamon, coming through as well, Taste follows the nose, with a very nice balance of roasted malt, a strong coffee presence with spicy notes of nutmeg and cinnamon and dark, bitter chocolate, as well as hints of herbal hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some coffee and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  I've managed to grab a bottle of this recently that was a lot fresher than previous bottles and it's amazing to me how much more vibrant the coffee notes are in this one. My previous bottles were usually 6-12 months old and I always thought it was weird how I got a lot more chocolate than coffee from this, while I'm probably having this the way it's supposed to taste like with this 3 months old bottle for the first time now. Really intense coffee character, although I still think that the mouthfeel, while nice, could be better.","  rDev Draft at the Industry. Dark brown, milky , tight creamy beige head. Curtains of lacing. Aroma is chocolate and roast grains, coffee. Taste is more chocolate, mildly sweet, dark chocolate bitterness. Slick and sweet. Just wonderful.","  rDev 355 mL bottle from an LCBO 4-pack; best before July 8 2018 and served barely chilled. First 'had' in 2015, though I've re-sampled it roughly a half-dozen times since then. Needless to say, It's long overdue for a review.  This jet black stout comes equipped with a quarter-inch of frothy, tan-coloured head that fades away within 90 seconds; the only significant remnants are a tight, creamy collar and some foamy patches of bubbles floating upon the surface. Smells quite rich and rather sweet - I'm getting subtle notes of prune and date underneath a torrent of roasted malt goodness. Dark chocolate, treacle and toffee are more prominent than notes of earthy coffee grounds; there are also minor aspects of ethanol, vanilla, coffee cake and herbal licorice.  Seriously yummy stuff - there's an array of competing flavours, but that's fine by me because they melt together perfectly. Flavours of dark chocolate, cocoa powder and oatmeal sweetness come through at first, along with some molasses and caramelized malts. This is followed closely by fruity hints of fig and date - an important inclusion, because we all know that fruit is a vital component of any balanced breakfast. The coffee grounds start to kick in towards the back end, offering up an earthy bitterness as well as a pleasant roasted quality that will bring a smile to the face of any coffee addict. Coffee and chocolate both linger into the aftertaste, almost completely masking the alcohol content. If I didn't need to drive to work in the morning, I think I would actually be tempted to substitute this for my usual 8 AM java. In the vicinity of full-bodied, with light carbonation that meekly nudges the surfaces of the palate, to little effect - feels silky-smooth and soft in the mouth. I can't think of any other imperial stouts I've tried that went down the hatch with such sublime ease.  Final Grade: 4.38, a superlative A grade. Founders Breakfast Stout lives up to its hype. This is an excellent imperial stout with deep, complex, well-integrated flavour combinations - yet it's also one that I could drink on the regular. Ontario BAs should probably buy this one in bulk while it's still available - there really aren't any genuinely comparable alternatives (domestic or otherwise) at the LCBO right now.","  rDev Serving: Bottle Best before: Aug-7-2018   A: Pours pitch black with a couple fingers of tight tan head that eventually all but disappears. Ok retention; speckled lacing. (4.25)  S: Rich, thick coffee aromas mixed with baker's chocolate, Roasted walnuts, leather, Brown sugar, red fruits and vanilla. (4.5)  T: Follows the nose. Coffee with a light cocoa aromatic quality to the finish, some oaty sweetness, some nuttiness.  (4.5)  M: Full body with a velvet feel, a heft to the body medium carbonation and a lingering alcohol/roasty finish. (4.5)  O: A very, very nice stout. Just really does exactly what it says it will and what you hope it will. Looks nice enough and from there on out is great. A cohesive aroma-flavor package of coffee, oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon, chocolate and a bitter roast bite to finish.  Fabulous. I really wish I could get this one regularly. (4.5)","  rDev 12/7/17: 12 ounce pour into nonic at Monk's Pub. Dark black pour, thin minimal tan head. Minimal faint chocolate and coffee aroma. Chocolate taste, bread, hint of coffee. Neutral balance. Thin texture dry, smooth drinking. good offering by Founders.","  rDev Another one that I ticked years ago but have never reviewed. From bottle to nonic pint glass. Pour is a rich cola color with a few fingers of mocha head. Aroma is lots of roasted coffee notes with dark chocolate and bread and earthy notes. Flavor is straight coffee with bitter dark chocolate bites. Rich and full. No boozy burn. Ridiculously Smooth and semi full feel. A meal in a bottle.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. Bottled 10/20/17.  Appearance: totally black with two finger of frothy dark-tan foam atop. Dig it!  Smell: rich, smooth coffee right at first, segueing into a sweeter, chocolatier, maltier character. Very nice indeed.  Taste: tons of coffee at first, transitioning into a more chocolate-based flavor at the end; it's got the same dynamics as the aroma. Finish is deep and bitter, very much like a dark chocolate. Nicely complex and very tasty indeed.  Mouthfeel: rich body with a low-to-moderate carbonation; it's not super creamy, but it's not bad either.  Overall: a very good beer indeed. I am very happy we now get Founders distributed in Washington.","  rDev Color is so dark I'll call it black. Small tan cap.  Aroma of roasted malt and coffee but not heavily so. There is something almost sweet in the background which I presume is chocolate.  Taste is roast malt/coffee on entry and this holds until the end. Bitterness from whatever source is a bit more pronounced at the finish and in the aftertaste.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  This one is better put together than most Stouts I've tasted. The flavors are simple but so well knit together it gives off a sense of complexity even though it relies on simple flavors. IBU is listed as 60 but I really don't taste that level of hopping present. Brewer mentions imported chocolate which to me means dark, bitter chocolate in the European style and while I don't actually taste that in this brew there is decidedly something extra in the overall flavor. I understand why this is so popular.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Bottled on '09.01.17'. Dark tan head on very dark, opaque body, Thicker head with good coverage of lacing. Coffee and chocolate dominate on the aroma, dark roasted backbone. Very balanced flavor of dark sweet chocolate, slightly bitter but flavorful coffee, and roasted malt. Fades away with all tastes in balance. Smooth, somewhat creamy mouth feel, on the dry side. A wonder for those who enjoy a heavily coffee infused stout with chocolate balance.","  rDev Black in color with a nice amount of carbonation. A really nice thick,creamy feel that was perfect match for the intense flavor. Aroma was strong black coffee with a touch of cream and followed by come cocoa. Taste was identical ,strong,and left no doubt about what flavors I was tasting. They weren't cheap with the flavor in this beer and with the thick creamy feel it was an excellent beer.","  rDev 12oz bottle dated 09/29/16 Dark opaque brown body allows no light through and is capped with a persistent light brown 1/8in head.  Aromas include bitter roasted coffee bean and cocoa powder. Flavors match with less emphasis on the coffee after a year. Mouthfeel is creamy, if slightly thin and barely chalky with a nice dry finish.  Overall waiting a year was a good experiment. Still a fantastic beer.","  rDev 12oz bottled 8/25/17 poured into a pint glass at fridge temp 8.3% ABV 60 IBU. The beer pours dense dark brown, nearly black with red tinted mocha head. No light penetrates this beer at any angle. The head recedes to a thin ring and paper thin island. Aroma is as advertised. Chocolate, coffee, and roast malt abound. Taste is slightly tangy sweetish malt and chocolate giving way to a bitter coffee finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated, creamy and dry. To pull of a perfect tasty dry finish in a beer like this is somewhat magical. Overall, great. This beer is really good but anyone adverse to coffee or bitterness might want to wade in gently. This presents itself more bitter than any 60 IBU in my recollection. Note: This beer became more enjoyable and balanced as it warmed. If you don't love the first few sips, let it warms a bit and retry.","  rDev L: -pours the darkest of brown with no light coming through and a medium,foamy,khaki head S: -coffee,licorice,tobacco,chocolate,syrupy,raisins,molasses,herbal T: -Follows the nose + some sour-ish Plums F: -medium carbonation -medium body -slight alcohol noticeable O: A great Imperial Coffee Stout. Some lower carbonation would be nice.","  rDev Pours a black color with a minimal tan head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Tastes of sweet chocolate, coffee, vanilla and sugar with a light bitterness at the end.","  rDev Vice dark appearance. Little head. Definite coffee aroma. Coffee taste is not the best I have ever had. A little thin for a stout. No alcohol taste."]},{"Name":"90 Minute IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/2093/","Brewery":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":9.00,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Never had a beer like this one before.

Plenty of taste, you might say ...","  rDev 12oz bottle. Stamped on bottle neck is best by of 'Aug 2021'. Revised, updated label. Clear, deep gold colored body. One finger white head. Fragmented sheets of lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine hops with a malt backbone. Taste is sweet caramel malt, with a hop punch that is dank, piney, with a bit of citrus. Aftertaste is a sweet caramel and pine candy bar.  Fuller mouth feel, and an invitation to swirl the beer in the mouth. Very good carbonation. Has a bit of a dry finish due to the alcohol percentage. Excellent balance of sweet and bite. Allows the higher ABV% to express, but not to burn. Old school goodness.","  rDev A pint of golden bronze came from a tap head, replete with a solid and a lasting white topping. The head and glass lacing endured a slow and savory finish of the beer. This ale has everything it should and nothing it shouldn't. There're sweet malts, body, hoppy bitterness and softness to the palate, all in perfect unison. Consistent from first taste to the last drop, this is remarkabley excellent.","  rDev Botted 07/01/20. At 75 days, probably the freshest I've seen/had it, so might as well review it. :)   Slightly hazy orange-amber, with light, creamy, off-white head.   Smell is candied citrus rind - mostly orange, a deep, rich, rounded pine smell, toffee, and a sweet, bread+honey malt aroma.   Taste is similar to aroma, but milder, and more evenly balanced.Starts with a syrupy orange flavor, followed by light pine, then a blend of toffee,bread , and floral &amp; herbal hop flavor. Light-moderate bitterness balances the sweeter elements. In actuality, it's probably more bitter than I'm perceiving it, given what it's countering, but it's not that noticeable.   Feel is medium, initially mildly creamy, becoming lightly prickly as the very,very fine carbonation kicks in. Leaves a syrupy coating on the tongue .   Overall, thoroughly enjoyable. A classic for a reason. Worth a try . :)","  rDev Really a fantastic example of a widely-available DIPA. Bursting with a balanced melange of flavors, leading with nectarine and other stone fruits, transitioning to resinous hop bitterness and florals, backed up with plenty of malt. Lovely.","  rDev 16 oz can poured into an imperial shaker pint.  Appearance Golden amber. Excellent clarity. 1+ finger of fluffy off-white head. Lively carbonation.   Nose Caramel, toffee, potpourri, florals, pine, grapefruit, and lemon.  Taste Firm caramel and toffee maltiness. Some Tootsie Roll. Grapefruit, lemon zest, florals, and pine needles.   Mouthfeel Medium-light bodied, sticky, smooth, and lightly bitter.   Overall I’m kicking it old school tonight. 90 Minute was the beer I requested to have at my wedding in 2011. By today’s hop standards I guess this could be considered an Imperial Amber Ale, but nothing if not a classic.","  rDev Drinking this at home, from a bottle poured into a pint glass. Appears amber, with a nice foamy head and lacing. Smells citrusy, piney. Taste follows the nose. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall, despite the slightly boozy taste, very good and I would definitely order again.","  rDev Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA, 9% ABV. Pours pale red with a 2-finger white head. Nose is sweet fruit, caramel/toffee, and slight pine. Taste is sweet fruit and moderately bitter hops. Excellent mouthfeel, overall outstanding.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) into a Sam Adams custom taster; bottled 10/21/19. A: Pours a basically clear, amber color, although the powerful early effervescence makes in appear cloudy, a two to three finger, meringue colored head, incredible retention, and powerful, foamy, and persistent lacing. S: Aromas of caramel, pink grapefruit to orange, and pine in glorious balance. T: Sweet. Flavors follow the nose, but seems complex in its simplicity. Solid, but not overpower, i.e balanced bitterness. M: Medium bodied with very robust carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. O: Wow! This was a bit of a revelation. I was really impressed by the flavor and the quality of 90 minutes. Just delicious.","  rDev De Beershelf. En copa Teku. Viendo Mr Robot 2x07.

Thanks Ian!","  rDev Strong aroma of malts, candi sugar, a little grain and cracker. The hops come off earthy,grass, wood Taste is very similar, malty richness is in the forefront. Dark fruits, earthy grass hops but the malt and dark fruit is the main character","  rDev So I either somehow missed reviewing this, or it got lost in a server crash. Either way this is long overdue. And now cans, yay! Canned 1/29/19 Pours with a giant foamy creamy 2+ finger off-white head, great retention and some lacing, very clear golden-orange slight amber color  Nose good balance of big hops and sweet malts, candy like toasty malts, little grainy-sweet with some cracker and a little white bread crusts, with big hops, earthy spicy and piney, with a background citrus note  Taste again big sweet malts out front, candy notes without being syrupy, toasty grainy and more bread crust like but not quite Maillard just grainy sweet, then hops with medium-high bitterness, spicy flavor with a bit of pine and earthy, touch of citrus and grapefruit zest, candied orange marmalade like, finish attempts to dry but still a bit sticky sweet, some alcohol kicks in on the drying with lingering sweet malts and piney earthy hops, as well as more orange marmalade, but all balanced nicely  Mouth is med to fuller bod, higher fluffy carb, a bit of warming alcohol  Overall quite nice, I think my original review like 10 years ago would have been higher as IPAs especially have changed a lot since then, but this is still a nice IPA, good balance, nice hop and malt characters, well done","  rDev From notes 8/23/13: Pours a nice deep gold/pale amber producing 2 inches of creamy, chunky, beige head which leaves behind moderate webby lacing as it recedes. Aroma is caramel, faint vanilla swimming inpine, citrus, floral and fruity hop notes. Taste is caramel malt sweetness balanced with pine and citrus hops with a hint of apple/pear in the finish. Starts sweet; finishes dry and bitter. A good example of an early American craft Imperial IPA.","  rDev Comes in a clear copper color with fluffy white head. Perfect retention. Lots of vibrant carbonation. Streaky lacing left behind. The aroma is grapefruit zest, orange peel, blood orange, pine cone, caramel, mineral water, honeycomb, pine sap, pine needle. The taste follows the nose pretty closely with lots of pine needle and pine sap, crystal sweetness without cloy. Caramel and biscuit. Some citrus presence through orange zest, grapefruit, and blood orange essence. Zesty and bitter citrus rather than juice, with the pine most forward. Crisp and clean overall. A hint of alcohol warmth. Quite bitter, with lingering citrus bitterness. Dangerously drinkable. Medium-plus mouthfeel, smooth and and oily and highly carbonated. Sets the standard for old-school IPA, unremarkable but well-made. A solid beer.","  rDev So, I'm revisiting this, my first review, directly after my 1000th review. This is a classic that I need to revisit and properly review. Updated 2/26/22, best by 7/22. Let's get into it  Pours a clear orange gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing. Going up a quarter point  This is wonderfully balanced in the aroma, dank and sweet together. I'm picking up on aromas of resinous hops, sweet caramel, orange rind, bready malt, light grapefruit, and toffee. Going up a quarter point  The taste follows the nose pretty closely in this beer, an admirable quality for a classic. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, bready malt, caramel, piney hops, white pepper, and light grapefruit. The swallow brings notes of resinous hops, toffee, bready malt, white pepper, orange marmalade, and grapefruit. Going up a quarter point  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice balance. Going up 3 quarters of a point  Well, this is certainly better than when I first reviewed it. But I think that's less of a reflection on the beer than it is on my palate over 1000 reviews. All scores have gone up, overall going up by a half point  ----------------------------------------------------------  Bottled 8/1/18, Original Review 10/29/18  Picked up a sixer and will definitely age some of this. Clearish orange color with a two finger head, smells of piney, fruity, floral hops. The taste is unfamiliar and dark at first, but settles to a sweet and bitter tropical taste. Very floral and hoppy on the aftertaste. A thinner mouthfeel than expected but with moderate carbonation. IPA is not my favorite style, but DFH did a damn good job on this one. Truly a classic brew, highly complex but balanced.  Original score:  3.96/5 rDev -7.3% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75  EDIT 2/4/19: After 6 months of sitting on this same batch, it has mellowed in an interesting fashion, the hops are inconsistent, only coming through in certain sips. The stone fruit character is brought out by this, which hides the 9% ABV very well. It's hard to say if after 6 months the quality has gone up or down, so I will leave the rating the same. It's different, but still fantastic. I look forward to trying it after a year  EDIT 8/1/19: It was bottled exactly a year ago, and coincidentally it’s IPA Day! After a year, this is nearly an all out malt bomb. It has lost its’ signature hop characteristics completely and almost tastes like a different style, perhaps a blonde ale. Once again, I will leave my rating the same as it wouldn’t be fair to lower it after a year, even though it doesn’t really hold up. I have 1 more, so I might as well just give it another year  EDIT 9/14/20: Back to the same batch of the first beer I reviewed once more. I’ve learned so much about beer since then and have grown to appreciate so many styles and flavors. 2+ years in the cellar. A lot of sweeter molasses and sherry appear in both the flavor and the aroma, lending to a smooth sweetish citrus vibe. The hops are still present in the back end but thing crazy. Still very good after all this time and I’ll always look back on this beer with nostalgia","  rDev Excellent IPA - amazing that it’s a double and not just a standard one since the alcohol is so well-hidden despite the high ABV. Nice amber color with just a little head and minimal lingering lacing. Smells great, nice fruity hops. Tastes of citrus and floral hops, caramel, grain and a great malt backbone. Very little bitterness. The hops flavor was definitely a little understated - that could be both a good and bad thing. Nice and smooth, goes down easy and mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. Very well done - will have to try this brewery’s other IPAs.","  rDev Pours a hazy, golden color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is spicy and herbal with a hint of pineapple.  Taste is smooth and creamy with a big hop flavor.","  rDev For rating number 200--a long time favorite of others that just finally became available here on the barren prairie...  One of the prettiest IPA's I've seen. Amber and shimmering with just a touch of haze and a fantastic head that lasts and lasts.  Despite being an IPA, this brew has a strong malt presence on the nose, although the hops deliver in mostly a floral way. The aroma overall is somewhat muted and a little disappointing given the billing and notoriety--still, on its own merits a fine aroma.  The flavor comes to the rescue though. Again, a strong malt backbone that presents with tropical-fruit sweetness and nuttiness, followed by a wallop of both floral and citrus/piney hoppiness. Not devastating but definitely tongue-tingling with just a touch of background booze. Excellent.  The mouthfeel is very complex. The strong malt base brings a viscous, almost chewy character, but the booze and carbonation thin it to a crisp, though definitely not dry, finish. Substantial but not heavy, and not sticky.  Overall, a yummy 200th brew.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip  L: Nearly clear golden copper pour with a solid 1.5 figners of foamy white head. Nice lacing.  S: Resinous pine, caramel malts. Aromatic with some floral notes.  T/F: Big malt backbone... sweet caramel and toasted grains. Bitterness follows... evergreen/pine, light fruit, and floral tones. Complex... slightly earthy. Balanced... light citrus comes through at the finish. Medium to light bodied.  O: A fantastic DIPA that I've had many, many times. Even as I've gotten more into the New England juice bombs this one never fails to please. A beer that was ahead of its time and still great today.","  rDev Poured from a bottle on date 12/16/17 into the pint glass A - Orange blossom honey color, wonderful clarity, small spheres meander top side, a quick pour yields a 1  white cap S - Strong malts, some warm bread element, lots of honey and a delightful earthy thread T - Apricot reduction, some orange rime, green tea, and excellent sweet malt M - Slick, a full body on this offering, the linger has hints of ginger tea O - A long overdue review, this offering is exceptional, big, a bit slimy, and full in every aspect","  rDev Fantastic, perhaps not for the first time IPA drinker. Take everything about the 60 minute version and multiply it by 1.5 (get it?). Taste, smell and feel in much fuller and front forward with each sip. If enjoying a 60 minute is like getting your bachelor's degree enjoying this one is like getting your masters (I'm sure you know which dogfish gets you your PHD!!).","  rDev A great Double IPA by Dogfish Head! Not as sweet or tropical as other West Coast style IPAs, but a very smooth and drinkable DIPA that doesn't overpower you with alcohol kick at the end. For it being 9.0% ABV, smooth and great feel is an understatement!","  rDev 12oz bottled 9/28/17 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 9% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey amber in color with light tan head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is faint caramel and faint citrus/pine. The taste is semisweet caramel with a citrus undertone that transitions to piney moderate bitterness with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is some residual hop oil and unfermented sugar that keep the feel sticky, but not cloying. Overall, very good. A classic east coast IPA. Still enjoyable, but not nearly best in class.","  rDev This beer pours a slightly cloudy amber with a large head. The aroma is dense and dank, with pine, resin, cannabis, mango, tobacco, and grass. The flavor starts with rich sweet malt, leading or orange peel, sweet pine, cannabis, caramel, and a woodsy spice flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly full with bright but creamy carbonation. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer - not exciting, but tasty and dangerously drinkable.","  rDev From an undated 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had a decent head. Sweet hop aroma. Sugar sweet hoppiness is very nice. Good chewing beer. Easy drinking. Watch out. 9% ABV. ENJOY to the fullest.","  rDev Pours a frosted amber-orange with two fingers of dense, off-white foam. Head retention is fantastic, with great lacing left behind. Aroma is earthy and biscuity malts with floral hops. Not overly loud, but it is a dense, earthy aroma. Flavor profile puts floral, herbal hops on the tongue immediately, with a herbal hop finish. Earthy, biscuit malts swell up in the middle before stepping out of the way of the hop finish. Mouth feel is thick, with a huge, velvety texture. It's quite filling. Overall, this beer is 9% and definitely carries the presence of a 9% beer. While not extremely high, it is in dangerous territory. The thick feel, and dense flavor profile really level this one off as a pleasant sipper. Very enjoyable beer without an over-done bitterness.  Served in a 12oz snifter from bottle."]},{"Name":"Two Hearted Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/1093/","Brewery":"Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.00,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev From a 12oz bottle, dated 01/26/22.

Nose is malty, grainy, redolent of caramel sweetness.  Taste is thoroughly in line with the nose. Tasting grapefruit peel and orange, a little vaporous pine in the sinuses but, more than anything else, overwhelming caramel malt sweetness. I get a little apple juice character in the finish and beyond which I’m attributing to the yeast(?)  Feel is smooth and round, medium-dense bodied with ample carbonation.  Overall, not well balanced to my palate, all malty-sweet smoothness with very little hop bite. Nothing wrong with it, per se, just not quite my cup of tea.

Opened 2-13-22. 2+ finger off white head with amazing retention. Thick, fresh, and sticky lacing left behind. Orange amber IPA with ample carbonation visible and about 75% clarity. Floral nose with orange peel. Citrus, pine, and a phenomenal creamy malt sweetness that gives the finish some chew. Medium + body and carbonation. Moderate bitterness in a semi-sweet finish. Outstanding.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a clear amber color with a nice white head that reduces to a thin layer and leaves lots of lacing. The nose gets a pleasant bit of pine and malt. The taste is pleasant with just a hint of bitter. Nice.","  rDev I've had this many time over the years, but I was finally able to pick up a bottle to really sit back, enjoy, and then review...  As with all the other times I have drank this, it was truly a special experience. An IPA that I rank up there with Cigar City's Jai Alai, the brew is a staple now in many a bar and my go-to if I don't seen anything that I like. This has never failed, never come across a bad batch - it's simply consistent and a testament to it's long-running standing in the craft community.","  rDev Can pour- almost clear orange blossom honey color with thick white head leaving moderate frosty lacing. Nose is a bit of citrus and pine with sweet malt. Taste follows with a step up on the malt.Finishes on the dry side with a lingering hop bite.","  rDev Bottled 4/21/2020.  Almost-clear orangey-amber, with substantial off-white head.   Smell is pine, slight grass, orange rind, with some sweet(ish) floral notes. A little bit of caramel in the background.   Taste is pretty close to the aroma, but with the caramel malt notes a bit more noticeable, plus a bit of grapefruit rind. Moderate bitterness, that is in good balance with the rest.   Feel is smooth, barely oily, with moderate, relatively soft carbonation, that gives a little bite at finish and beyond.  Overall , smooth, easy-drinking, and always a pleasure. Always glad when I can find it not-old. ;) It's considered a classic for good reason. (Because it IS! :) )","  rDev Prettier than it tastes. Smooth and balanced enough, but perhaps the hop character lasts a little too long, unless you love centennial hops. I guess I don't.","  rDev Drinking this from a bottle poured into a pint glass. Appears clear, orange with a nice foamy head and lacing. Smells aromatic, citrusy, grapefruit. The taste follows the nose. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall a nice ale, very aromatic that just adds to the flavor. I'd definitely order again.","  rDev Pours light, clear bronze with patchy, short lived head that coats the glass in lace trails. Grapefruit, lemon, pine needles and caramel malt in the nose. Lots of citrusy hops burst in the taste. Delicate biscuity malts provide just enough balance. Medium bodied with creamy, textured carbonation. Medium bitterness and lots of citrusy hop flavor in the long finish.  A masterclass in IPA balance - forget all the new fangled hop varieties, centennial alone can more than get the job done. A classic and a must try.","  rDev L: Pretty standard translucent copper gold, but with a wonderful three-finger Ivory head settling down to a thick cap with a wonderful sticky lacing.  S: Biscuity malt, pine and citrus rinds, an small floral note. Enticing.  T: Incredible balance to the likes of which is rarely found. Less malty than the nose which is great.  F: Creamy medium mouthfeel, low bitterness and a gentle carbonation.  O: The balance of this brew is greater than the sum of its parts. I’ve seen this one posted countless times in BA and now that I’ve finally had it on tap I understand why. It’s a top notch IPA.","  rDev Bottled 6/26/15; drank 8/1/15 @ the Yarchives.   Murky orange appearance.   Eggshell head; nice lace.   Orange juice &amp; mild mango notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Bold orange citrus &amp; mango flavors; no bitterness on the finish.   This citrus lover was in heaven.","  rDev Slightly chill hazed orange-gold. Big white head, excellent retention and lace Grapefruit, pine, any array of floral aromas, and some hints at a malty background. Flavor pretty much follows aroma, a bit more sweet citrus and a touch of caramel malt round it out Mouthfeel and carbonation are spot on for the style. There's a reason this is a living legend of a beer still. It's even better than when I first tasted it 15 years ago.","  rDev 12oz can. Stamped canning date on can bottom is '081219'. Pale gold colored body, with a bit of haze. Two fingers of small bubble white head. Leaves behind small sheets and spots of lacing. Aroma of piney hops, some citrus, some honey sweetness, and a malt base. Taste of the piney hops, along with citrus. A combination of resin and grapefruit pith at the end. Front end expresses a sweet touch. Good malt base.  Medium mouth feel, with some smoothness in the texture. Very good carbonation. Extremely well balanced. Pleasant transition from initial pine resin to a sweet touch and then ending with a more bitter and resin like end. I have passed by this beer for years now but after trying Double Two Hearted I was compelled to try the original stuff. Well worth the wait.","  rDev This is a well balanced and pretty good IPA  Look: golden with a thick white head and good lacing  Aroma: subdued aroma of honey, grapefruit, slight pine  Flavor: malty/bready with honey sweetness, there's grapefruit, and I think apple, followed by slight pine resin. Well balanced and pretty good.  Feel: light to medium body","  rDev 20 oz. Can Canned on 9/24/18. (Shelf life: 6 months) opened on 11/26/18   Pours out looking Amber and gold, tight, creamy and frothy suds, off white color. Amazing retention. Sticky-icky lacing left overs.  The smell of the 100% Cenntenial hops dominates the nose. Super sweet &amp; fruity, strawberry pie, creamy tropical pineapple and hearty, herbalized earthy tones make for a very unique and bold aroma. Pretty sure the amber-style malt brings in more honey style sweetness in a subtle way.  This comes across as a much more  balanced  west coast style IPA in the flavor profile overall. Earthy, citrus, some laid-back pineapple and tropical fruit flavors from the Cenntenial-only hops. Herbal and hearty effects deep down with a mild but dry hoppy finish. The malt is medium to full, Amber sweetness of honey soaked dark bread does provide a classic, strong backbone for some old-school balance.   I cannot believe it's taken me this long to review such a classic IPA. A friend purchased it today, and I'm so glad he did.","  rDev Had the beer on tap at a local music club. The beer was a little bit murky with an amber color and a nice thin white head with lacing on the sides. Good aromas of hops, dark fruit, and pine. The flavor was generally bittersweet thanks to a good malt flavoring. Medium body; good balance of creaminess and carbonation. Overall, a good, solid IPA.","  rDev From notes 8/24/13. Pours a very deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, moderately lasting head that leaves behind unbelievable rings, streaks and webs of clumpy lace. Aroma is citrus and floral hops somewhat balanced with a nice sweet malt. Taste is citrus, sweet malts, caramel, pine and pepper (in that order). A nice dry finish, the taste is also well balanced.","  rDev 11/4/18 (Chicago): Canned 9/25/18, purchased at Bell's General Store earlier in the day, 6 pack cans $11.50 w/ tax. Can poured into pint glass. Slighty dark golden color, puffy head, thick lacing, solid carbonation. Citrus pine aroma, sharp pleasant, sweet. Very well balanced, citrus pine taste, dry hops, bitter nice. Dry creamy mouth feel, solid presence, smooth drinking. Overall excellent IPA, glad I stopped at Bell's Brewery for this one!","  rDev Pours a medium amber coloration with a medium, creamy head. Not very intense, but nice aromas of biscuity malt, grapefruit, orange peel and a hint of pine in the nose. Taste follows suit, with a very nice balance of biscuity, slightly caramelly malt and lightly resinous citrus hops. Notes of grapefruit, orange peel and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some light pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  Classic old school IPA with a certain West Coast accent to it. Quite nice for what it is and really well-balanced.","  rDev Cloudy light amber color with around a medium body. Aroma is citrus, bitter grapefruit Taste was orange fruit and peel along with grapefruit and more citrus.  Overall it's a very good beer, not a hop bomb bit an easy drinking beer","  rDev Pours a hazy but shimmering copper gold with a fine head and excellent creamy lacing. A super start.  The aroma is inviting with the only drawback being that it is subdued. A well-balanced presentation of malts countered with ruby-red grapefruit and pine resin. Clean and the paragon of an IPA, I just wish there was more of what is a good smell.  The flavor is everything that one could want in an IPA. There is a strong malt spine that helps provide a  base  for a wide-ranging and balanced bitter counterpoint that is equal parts citrus (grapefruit) and evergreen. Undeniably hoppy and bitter, yet (thankfully) not trying to win an IBU prize. The word here is  balance  and it's spectacular.   The bitterness, carbonation, and a hint of booze all combine for a drying crisp finish that makes this very drinkable.   I can't believe that I've delayed this long in trying and reviewing this brew. The IPA style became  worn out  for me a couple of years ago, but I've returned to try it anew. This brew is an excellent representation of the style. Undeniably hoppy and bitter, but well balanced and restrained on that point.","  rDev Very new to my area. My first time drinking a Bells beer.  Semi-cloudy golden color with a 4F head. good head retention.  Mostly malty, piney-sweet aroma. Not very pronounced.  Light body, sticky MF ( I like this in an IPA) more malt forward than other IPAs.  Citrus, pine, not too pronounced , but good.  Overall- solid IPA. I wasn't wowed. We have a lot of excellent beers in my area. This is a classic, but the citrus is not as pronounced as other beers in the same style. I do like the sticky, more malt forward drinkability of the beer.","  rDev New to the MA area so picked up my first sixer. Aroma is subtle, more grain than hops. Pours a golden amber color with about 1/2  head, not a lot of lacing. This reminds me of an English style ale, very nicely balanced - solid malt backbonethat's not overly sweet with a subdued hoppiness. Carbonation is somewhat subdued as well but the end result is an easily drinkable, world class beer. Subtle bitterness lingers on the palate but never overpowers. Beer that tastes like beer should, no juicy, mango, citrus nonsense going on here. Very nice, I d buy this again in a heartbeat.","  rDev A: Pours a copper color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing  S: Grassy and floral hops up front along with some fruity and piney notes. Some caramel maltiness in there as well  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the floral and fruity hops and then goes into a mix of caramel and earthy/grassy notes. Bitterness is balanced very well. Finishes with lingering caramel and floral notes  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A very good IPA that is extremely well balanced and easy to drink. Deceptively hoppy","  rDev Pours to a generous white head that lasts and laces. Hazy gold copper. Aroma is sweet crystal malts, fruity yeast esters and piney, fruity hops. Flavor is balanced with crisp, biscuity malts and still decently hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium. This is what an IPA should be. Hop forward but with a substantial malt contribution.","  rDev Pretty gold color with a large white head. There was a good deal of lace. Citrus and pine aroma. Sweet malt.  Grapefruit and pine taste. Caramel. Nice bitter mouthfeel.","  rDev A famous West Michigan IPA for good reason - truly a solid, reliable, always-delicious IPA. Saw it on tap one day and finally decided to try it. Nice deep golden color, medium thick head, nice notes of hoppiness, fruit and pine. Only very light bitterness throughout. Smooth mouthfeel and nice lingering aftertaste of faint hops. A pleasure to sip and savor.","  rDev Pretty much shocked I haven't rated this one yet...could have sworn I have. Not sure what there is to say that 3,600+ reviews haven't already said. Amazing orange rind and marmalade in this one, both in the nose and flavor. One of those beer that I will almost always buy if I see there is a fresh pack. Top to bottom a first rate IPA and should (and is) known as one of the rock solid standards for the style. Overall, great.","  rDev Can from Whole Foods. Medium amber/golden with nice fluffy head. Looks great. Aroma is malty, bready, a hint of hops. Taste brings the hops forward, but this is a not big hoppy IPA, so they support the malt bill, working with it. very well rounded, smooth, nice textures. Worthy of its reputation. Been seeking this for a while.","  rDev 12oz canned 11/14/17 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours slightly hazy light amber with sticky off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is citrus and pine. The taste is a lovely balance of caramel malt and citrus &amp; pine from the centennial hops. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, well carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is a little sticky hop oil and caramel finish that is again: balanced. Overall, excellent. The hardest thing about reviewing this beer is slowing down enough to take some notes. If you enjoy a balanced IPA and find this fresh, get some.","  rDev Two Hearted Ale brewed by Bell's Brewery, Inc., with an ABV of 7.00% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice thick white head. The head to this brew sticks around. There is a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, earthy grains and malts. This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on the Hoppy bitterness, the a nice smoothness of earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice slight sweetness at the end note of this brew. Two hearted Ale , has a lot going on in it. The body of this American IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a real nice balance to it. This is one of the more enjoyable IPA's I have had in awhile. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew,it is just that smooth. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. This brew would go nice with dinner. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Smooth, Clean, and Refreshing. Overall I'm Two Hearted Ale, a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Bell's Brewery, Inc., did a super nice job with this American IPA."]},{"Name":"Pliny The Elder","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/","Brewery":"Russian River Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":8.00,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev This was a long « want » of mine and I got the chance to finally sip on it thanks again to Beergoot.

This is one of the first beers I heard about after joining BA, and I finally sourced 2 bottles, relatively fresh as well! I don't know what more to say, so let's just get into it  Pours a clear yellow gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing. An endless stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass  Oh man, the nose on this one isn't super complex, but it's right in your face. I'm picking up on aromas of resinous hops, caramel malt, fresh pine, orange zest, wildflower honey, and light white pepper  This is very expressive, but very balanced. There's nothing angular about this one; the beauty is in the balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange zest, floral hops, crackery malt, white pepper, pineapple, light honey, and tangerine.

Taste is piney, malts and citrus are present, significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall if you get a chance to try this beer, do it.","  rDev A generous share from Erland. Pours out to a slightly hazy pale straw yellow, forming a rocky white head with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The nose is mostly pine and then some grapefruit. A little bit of cat pee. Mouthfeel is prickly and lighter bodied than given the ABV, so I suspect white sugar is added here to thin this out. Flavor again is pine and grapefruit. Not overly complex with a firm bitterness and a dry finish.  15 years ago, when there wasn't an absolute deluge of IPAS/ DIPAs on the market, I could see why this gained some notoriety. In todays market, it pales to the abundance of choices. Growing up in Michigan where two hearted is the norm, the same thing has happened here. Still a great beer, but in the broader context, middling at best. This is a good thing though.","  rDev Everything about this beer hits my perfection button. Classic combination of hops that I like, and they're well-balanced with the malt.","  rDev It is truly a beautiful rich and bright amber color in an eight ounce serving, inside a clear glass. There's a nice tight white head that seems to be perpetual. Despite the brightness and near translucenty, this has some body. Look at the lacing inside the glass, Wow! The aroma is of a good piney and biting hoppiness, but it's not overpowering. The taste is just about West Coast IPA perfect. That means there's a solid, but not sweet, malt body cleanly carrying a poignant resinous, yet dry bitter hop taste. Nothing out of whack, delightful across the tongue, rare is the beer better than this. A necessary advisory, this is from Philadelphia, three thousand miles away. It certainly must taste even better on the other side of the country.","  rDev From the can (IPA Fest in Cyberspace Provided), it pours a clear yellow golden color with a nice white head that remains for a long time. In the nose, it is citrus, mostly pineapple, and is enjoyable. In the mouth, it is the same, with a solid malt base. Very nice brew!","  rDev Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate white head. Very nice hoppy aroma, fruity and herbal notes. Intense hoppy flavour, but not too bitter. Fruity and spicy notes, well balanced.","  rDev 510ml bottled on 02/02/2021.  Not packaged from resale.  Sample from the brewery. Thanks, Vinnie!  I've consumed Pliny the Elder hundreds of times over the years, and most of those were on draught at The Falling Rock when I lived in Denver, but I've never sat down with a bottle for a proper review on my own.  Pours a lively, light, pale, honey colored beer with a hint of haze and a thick, creamy head that laces down the glass with each sip. Big piney note in the nose with citrus and a soft floral aroma. Mouthfeel is sublime. Crisp and prickly on the palate, and then creamy, firm, a bit chewy, and incredibly smooth. Malty sweet with a light clean breadiness. Hoppy and fruity with pineapple, orange, ripe, juicy, fleshy, tropical fruits, and grapefruit rind. This is broken up by a dry bitterness with pine, resin, and an oily and ashy presence that sticks to the palate for what seems like forever. And I want it to last forever. Biscuit. Honey. Warming alcohol. Bone-dry finish. Spicy linger.  Despite the market being absolutely flooded with India Pale Ales, and good number of them being what I'd consider world-class, in 2021 Pliny the Elder still stands after all these years as the gold standard for both West Coast and Double IPAs. And after drinking it countless times, it never gets old.","  rDev Poured from a bottle. Straw in color with a large white head and lacing. Smells of pine, citrus and malt. Flavors of pine and citrus hit the palate, the mouth feel is incredibly smooth. It hides the higher avb while still feeling like a big beer. Best imperial ipa I've had!","  rDev L:. Pours a golden straw yellow with a fizzy white head and nice lacing on the glass.  S:. Lots of ripe tropical fruit, including mango, pineapple, orange, pineapple, pine and sap. Smells amazingly inviting.  T: Lots of tropical fruit, including mango pineapple, notes of pine, sap and berries, a medium bitterness. This is still the high point of the West Coast IPA.  F:. Medium to large body, but still nice and drinkable.  O:. Pliny still remains the benchmark of what a West Coast Double IPA should be.","  rDev At long last, Pliny is mine! Mostly clear golden body with a fluffy white head, decently active carbonation, lacing as you go. Plenty of west coast hops, pine, slight floral too, grapefruit, orange, and a touch of pineapple. Tastes as it smells, with slight caramel malt and botanicals, surprisingly sweet on the finish with hop resin. Feel is crisp, clean, and very well balanced. Can see why this was the toast of the town 17 years ago, still holds up as a good DIPA now","  rDev Bottled on 2/18/20; consumed on 3/4/20  Pours a brilliant deep golden copper touched by a vague fog to the body and topped with 2 fingers of dense, lasting white foam slowly fading to yield a landscape of thick, comprehensive lacing along with a thin cap and collar.  Aromas opens with subtle clementine, pine needles, and a quietly acidic grapefruit edging into a slight lemon zest in the middle of a seamlessly integrated malt character; soft tropical undertones shine forth with a lasting flow of overripe mango, peach skins, strawberry, and guava touches.  Taste presents tangerine prominently upfront with a sweeter pineapple building into a very quiet notion of evergreen needles and earth along the mid-palate; underripe grapefruit peel and hints of oregano precede and dark blueberry must and a flaky malt backing before a lingering tropical cream lingers beyond the swallow.  Mouthfeel offers an oily medium body with a medium carbonation perfectly entrenched in the background belying a near-unrivaled consistency across the mid-palate; flaky malt dryness eases to a deft coating of lupulin-laden hop oil contributing a mild though stiff bittering into a fluffy, truly effortless finish/swallow and a warming glow of innocuous alcohol presence.  A stunner of a DIPA refined to the highest level, running the spectrum of hop and malt harmony to an end product pure and comprehensive; simply the apex of the style, a dreamy culmination.","  rDev Well after a few years of drinking Elder and going to the Younger event in Santa Rosa i am posting this one. Bottles Feb.4th 2020 Drinking on Feb,26th so very fresh.  A awesome smooth Imperial, all i need to say after so many reviews.","  rDev Pours a clear golden color with an inch and a half fluffy white head. Smells of incredible citrus and pine. Tastes of grapefruit, grapefruit pith, orange, underripe peach and pine. Damn near perfect dankness. Medium bodied and carbonated, dry and bitter finish","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed October 2012.  Big citric orange peel, tangerine, and juicy grapefruit flavours, a bit of pineapple and nectarine mid-palate, spicy bitter hop finish with some warmth going down. Benchmark West Coast DIPA. ","  rDev 51cl bottle from California as a gift: Clear amber with some bubbles rising but it's lighter than expected. The head is fluffy &amp; white, holding very well with good lacing too. The smell was a fresh &amp; hoppy one with floral notes &amp; a pleasant bitterness, some grapefruit at the end too but nothing overly pronounced. Citrus &amp; grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine &amp; subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too. The body is strongly carbonated &amp; medium with a clean feel &amp; the alcohol content is hidden well too. Very nice &amp; easy to drink; not the best DIPA I've had but it is certainly up there.","  rDev Pours golden with chill haze. Floral nose. There's strawberry and grapefruit. It has remarkably clean flavors and none of the oniony character. The bitterness is clean. This is still a terrific and well-made IPA. Flavor wise, it is clean and well-engineered, but doesn't stand up as strong versus other legacy IPAs like Heady.","  rDev Bottled 3/25/14; drank 5/4/14 @ the Yarchives.   Clear orange/yellow hue.   Off-white head; nice lace.   Orange citrus nose; notes of pineapple &amp; pine.   Medium thin mouthfeel.   A refreshing mix of pineapple &amp; pine; a touch too bitter at the end.   A nice summer day IPA.","  rDev Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.  Aroma is a lovely pungent array of bright fresh pine, orangey citrus, with some floral notes - orange blossom, honeysuckle, and a hint of bright fresh cut lemon grass. While the hops are quite aromatic, there is a balance to this as there is a definite light malt backbone coming through even on the nose.   Taste is follows the nose with notes of citrus - lemon, orange, tangerine and orange rind - along with fresh pine and a bright floral notes. Solid cracker-y malt backbone comes through. Incredibly balanced and restrained while still being flavorful and complex. Mild bitterness on the back end with some more piney notes coming through. The classic west coast profile comes through here but without trying to punch you in the palate.   Feel is light, crisp, and pretty smooth. Does have a slight slick oiliness to it. Moderate carbonation with gentle finish.   Overall, this is a lovely IPA with a well earned reputation. What was perhaps most surprising to me was its incredible balance and deftness. In a market saturated with IPAs that try to one up each other, this beer knows what it is and does it so well. Admittedly I've wanted to this one for some time and it did not disappoint - I hope this is not the last time I have this beer.","  rDev Bright gold with a moderate head that sticks around for a few minutes before giving way to thin film that laces as consumed.   Gentle aromas. Stone fruit, slight dankness, a hint of bubble gum.   Citrus on the tongue with some piney hops and a very little dankness. Pleasantly bitter throughout.   Exceptionally crisp and yet full bodied substantial.   A great beer and rightfully at the pinacle of the west coast IPA hierarchy.","  rDev This IPA lived up to the hype. It was interesting as there was no mind-blowing moment here. No aspect stood out to polarize it. With each drink I came to realize that this beer has been finely and expertly tuned to perfection of the style - like tasting the work of a true master!","  rDev On tap at Brewer's Republic (COS) in February of 2019. L - Classic DIPA appearance, crystal dark amber gold, see through. Good head retention, nice lacing S - Fantastic, piney-bitterness cascading with a bit more malt whiff than I expected... T - Again, classic taste, as Pliny as Pliny gets, but with a bit more malt backbone than I remember... F - Near perfect carbonation, feel, bitterness, and great impression on the palate from start to finish O - a clear classic, not a haze-bruh, that endures because it's just fucking WELL MADE. Brewers elsewhere - see, it's not that hard!","  rDev 510ml with a bottled on date of 1-22-19 (opened 2-2-19). Golden, pale - clean. Active carbonation lifting a 1 1/2  white head. Good retention and thick, foamy lace. Classic. WC aromas of pine, grapefruit, lime, citrus, hint of pineapple - clean, fresh hop aromas! Bright flavors match the aroma, full of fresh fruit and citrus... 8% is undetectable, as delicious as this is I'd be on the floor before figuring it out. Bright, clean entry with a medium body, medium carbonation, and a LONG and flavorful finish.  True classic and a pleasure to drink anytime.","  rDev I received this from @bum4ever. Bottled on 12/11/2018 and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a crystal clear, golden-straw color with a large, fluffy, bright white cap and copious, soapy lacing. Large numbers of tiny bubbles ascend the glass. The nose features lemon and grapefruit. It's extremely crisp and clean. This is as clean and bitter as they come. There is tart, bitter citrus. The Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops are amazingly flavorful and provide a strong, bitter bite. It's the quintessential West Coast IPA. It is crisp and dry with an easy drinking 8% ABV. I don't know what more I can say; this is truly exquisite as fine an IPA as you'll find. I'm grateful to have tried it. Thanks, Josh!","  rDev From notes 12/14/11: Absolutely a hopheads delight. Pours a clear medium, wedding band, gold.The pour produces 2+ fingers of fluffy, moderately lasting, white head which leaves behind clumpy, sticky lacing. Super aroma with kaleidoscopic hoppiness: Pine, grapefruit, and thin tropical; sweet caramel malt and a earthy, leafy, herbal tea-like note. Taste is grapefruit and pine from start to finish back by malty caramel sweetness, a hint of toast and the leafy tea-like hint is there too. Very resinous. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would have thought but still medium bodied with good carbonation, a little sticky and oily but smooth. Among the finest IPAs.","  rDev Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco. A: Pours a slightly hazy, orange-amber color with a one half inch, white head, but on low retention and limited lacing noted. S: Almost floral aromas of tangerine and peach evident over a caramel malt spine. T: Semisweet. Palate follows the nose closely. Bitterness present and offsets excessive sweetness leading to clean, crisp finish. M: Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. O: Have been looking to give this a try for quite a while. Delicious ... worth the wait.","  rDev 7/19/18...on tap at Monks in Philadelphia. Pours bright gold, thick white foam. About 1/4 inch. Grapefruit malty nose,. Taste is even keeled, smooth grains and malts flow through. Super dry finish. Subtle but firm hop bitter. Pears and dried fruits are noted. Spectacular.","  rDev Served in a tulip glass from the bottle.   Appearance: Gold body with a slight amber tint to the body with heavy white head rising just over a finger's length off the body. Sticky lacing but very even settling after first sip.   Smell: Hops scent with heavy malty feel in the nostrils. Comes and goes and wish it was a touch more potent.   Taste: Citrus and woody flavor, you taste heavy grapefruit with a shuttle sweetness with doses of malt. It's good and real good but not the best I've had.   Mouth: Full carbonation and very full bodied. Sticky icky with a feel of love.   Overall: Good brew, I was definitely expecting more but I'm not complaining. Great gift from a good friend. Drink with love and enjoy. Salud!","  rDev On draft at the Toronado in San Francisco, I was disappointed in the taste as seemed to be all hop and not much else. I would like to revisit this but that may never happen again since the limited availability. I thought it would be more like Bear Republic's Cafe 15 Racer or Dogfish Heads 90 Minute IPA. Revisiting Pliny the Elder, 01/28/22, in a 17.25 ounce bottle dated 122921. The aroma is fabulous. Has lots of carbonation. I can say near 4 years later and many IPAs ago, the taste is better now than in 2018. That's what drinking IPAs will teach you. A little drier and hoppier than The Blind Pig. The Elder is a fine IPA. I upgraded my review. I'm blessed to have a friend like @RaulMondesi who shared his California beers.

A note here: it tastes nothing like what we have come to know as a NEIPA. It tastes like a hoppy lager.  F: Super smooooooth, creamy, full bodied. Superb!  O: Very tasty beer but it didn't live up to the hype. I mean, the best rated NEIPA in the world? Not even close.","  rDev Beautiful hazy golden color with thick, white lasting cap and excellent lacing.  Aroma of citrus and sharp hops. The citrus strikes me as somewhat tropical while the hops have touches of pine and something like the floor of a mature forest.  Flavor is a spectacular blend of citrus, hops and malt. I don't taste the malt so much as feel it's presence, but citrus and malt are on full display. This is a big beer in every sense, big flavors, big texture, 8% ABV, big aroma, big finish, yet it all comes together so harmoniously.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.  This is a World class beer worthy of any accolade I could put into words.","  rDev Review 1600 The Alchemist Heady Topper Date: 09 June 2021 It has been on my wants for years; I only dreamed of the day I got this beer. Once my holy grail, now on to the next whale. I have drunk 1600 beers on BA and Reviewed 99%. As I look back since I began this journey, I am dumbfounded by how far I have come. My palate continues to improve; with every sip of beer, my beer knowledge grows, and my appreciation for the craft multiplies exponentially. The beer is 44 degrees, and I used my Jester King glass. The pour created a massive three-fingered bright white head with excellent retention. The foamy and soapy head dissipated slowly, tatting lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 5, pale straw with light golden hues. The clarity of the beer is somewhat hazy, with yeast floating in the liquid. The beer is sublime.   The aromas are oranges, passion fruit, pineapple, toasted cracker, biscuit, bready, floral esters, a touch of pine resin, earthiness, and the ever so slight hint of grapefruit.   The flavors in the beer are oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, pineapple, peaches, bready, biscuit, floral esters, a touch of malty sweetness, a skosh of pine resin, earthiness, and toasted crackers.   The mouthfeel is astringent and a touch dry.   The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and long pleasant finish.   I cannot find anything wrong with this; damn near perfect. I wanted the hype not to be true, alas it is. The harmony and the balance are like watching a perfectly time ballet. This beer is incredible, one of my most favorite beers to date.","  rDev I know I'm supposed to drink it from the can... buuuut it pours a semi clear yellow orange color with a medium bodied white colored head that fades quickly but laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet roasted malts, a mix of earthy, floral, and citrus hops finish up the nose. Tastes of sweet roasted malts and then finishes of a nice mix of floral, earthy, and citrusy hops. It's somewhere in between the IPAs of yesterday and the NEIPA craze of today. It's crisp yet smooth, perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent beer.","  rDev Pint can of Heady-Topper dated 06/05/21. Served in a can glass, because I want to. Pours slightly hazy and with a nice white head, though not quite as cloudy or murky as Focal Banger. Aroma is not the most potent, but it has a more traditional pine hop profile than I expected. Inhaling deeply I do get a bit of sweet juice. Flavor is big on those tropical juicy flavors. Guava, mango, grapefruit zest. Where Focal Banger has considerable IBUs and conventional alpha bitterness, Heady Topper has the strength and even a hint of the 8% ABV is actually present on the palate. But this is really only a comparative defect; compared to millions of other IPAs the alcohol is still very well hidden.  Tasting this side by side with Focal Banger I appreciate the differences but confirm my initial impression from 4 years ago in Burlington -- I prefer FB. Both have an excellent mouthfeel, with very fine carbonation, which by itself might be remarkable for an American IPA in a can. But this beer is quite literally heady -- and I'm not one to shy away from heavy beers in the 8-12% range or even higher. But the balance and flavors in Focal Banger are just better in my opinion, even better than this unarguably great beer.  Potentially this is Heady Topper's 15,000th review??","  rDev Canned 6/21/21/Poured on 7/2/21...Sweet, tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and sweet piney-dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a malty-sweet, and prominent piney-hoppy bitter finish...some mild nuttiness shows up on the backend as it warms. This is an old-school, tasty brew...and I am glad I finally got to try this!","  rDev 16-ounce four-pack copped from Bottle King in Livingston. Incredible pour showcasing a plethora of citrus array and lemon peel yellow. Intense aroma redolent of apricot, pear and fresh morning dew. Top-notch brew. Explosive mixture of ripe flavors.","  rDev Pours a cloudy, semi-hazy, but not nearly opaque orange-golden color. A roughly 3-finger white head forms on the beer, then steadily dissipates leaving just a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. Aroma has notes of orange, citrus, some herbal hoppy notes, a touch of catty or weedy hop notes, and pineapple. Vey hop driven on the nose.   The taste is dominated by catty/weedy hops that have a certain woody, vegetal character to them. Secondary notes of orange, citrus and pineapple are present with notes of pine and pine needles on the finish. Feel is light to moderately bodied. Prickly carbonation. Sort of drier finish.","  rDev Poured from a can - hazy and cloudy yellow with thick white head leaving massive foamy/frosty lacing. Nose is a big mix of floral, citrus, tropical fruit and sweet malt. Taste follows with hints of pine and mild bitterness. Quite delightful.Comparing it to everything available on the west coast may be unfair as it is really good...OK it's great! An excellent brew.","  rDev Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. It's absolutely amazing. I had it as a sample at the Stowe brewery (pre-covid) and fresh from the can, same amazing taste. Mr. Kimmich is a legend and this is his legacy.","  rDev Hazy gold. Touch of orange. Smells of pine and spruce, sweet yellow peach, kings hawaiin rolls. Flavors of big evergreen, yellow “donut” peaches. There is a touch of sweetness that creates balance but this is still immense a flavorfully hoppy. Tang on the touch. Slick in the mouth. Lingering flavor. As it’s warming up there is some alcohol. A dry numbing quality in the mouth is there as well in the finish.   Canned end of December. I can understand why this is so loved. This is excellent. For me it is a treat and simply not an every day beer. If the price was not $19 a four pack? I still don’t know. I enjoy this but for me personally it’s a no because it reminds me of a local IPA. Not saying this is not a unique DIPA, I can sense this is in a class of its own. The softness off a beer this big is beyond impressive. Maybe it’s because many have tried to replicate that I’m getting similar vibes.   This beer cleared my sinuses.","  rDev Poured a few ounces into a small nonic to check for look and share with the wife. It's from a 16 ounce can dated 12/08/20. It is slightly hazy and an orange/yellow in color. It has a slightly skunky aroma and very hoppy. The hops come through and it's very different as a DIPA as it lacks any sweetness that often comes with this style. It's really more beer like to me and less juicy as they often are. I do get a some skunk on the tongue. This is a unique beer as I have not tasted anything like this in my hunt for IPAs. It's seems more Sixpoint Resin like and is an exceptional beer. The mouthfeel is simply easy drinking. Overall this is so different than what I am used to in a DIPA it defies my taste buds. I enjoyed Heady Topper very much and happy I got to try it. I hope it comes my way again someday or I get to go to Vermont and hang out with the Kimmichs. I drank it from the can. Special thanks to @laketang for the heads-up on getting this beer that I could only dream about.","  rDev Poured from 16oz can into a tulip. I'm excited to have finally been able to have a can of this. I know I'm supposed to drink it straight from the can, but a review has a process, you know?  Appearance: hazy medium golden hue; pretty standard for a hazy IPA these days, though I recognize this is the granddaddy of the style.  Smell: dank, grassy, and earthy. Smooth and intriguing; to be honest, not at all what I expected, but good.  Taste: green and vernal; fresh, and grassy in a good way. Bitterness minimal, befitting the style. Again, it's not at all what I expected; this beer has some weird dimensions to it but dang, it’s good.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a very good carbonation and creaminess. Wonderful.  Overall: this beer is weird and, on paper, wouldn’t be my jam. But dang am I enjoying it.","  rDev Canned 8/7/20. At 53 degrees looks exactly like Focal Banger (FB) - opaque almost hazy deep gold with some clarity under huge rocky white head; cap retention is good; lacing is medium heavy, but seems a bit less in volume than FB. Strong catty, dank grapefruit and lemon nose, followed by onion and garlic which become more pronounced as liquid warms. Taste is very bitter grapefruit and lemon; less sweet malt base than FB; strong bitter citrus and onion finish. Same feel as FB, medium body, moderate carbonation, bitter (100 IBU) tongue coating with no hop astringency; no warmth from 8% abv. Overall, the onion and garlic in nose and on tongue takes away from my enjoyment of this beer; I like the long bitter citrus rind linger; bold, assertive flavors for sure...just some I personally don’t want; I like Focal Banger so much more; I’ll drink HT again, but I couldn’t drink two in a row...","  rDev Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a muffin top pint glass; production information obscured. A: Pours a slightly hazy, golden color with solid carbonation and clearing, leaving a two finger, lemon chiffon head, strong retention (nearly a half finger for a while), and foamy rings of lacing.  S: Yeasty breadiness on opening. Aromas of grapefruit and pine out front with more subtle orange, peach, and perhaps papaya notes. Pineapple and the caramel maltiness and graininess come out as it warms. T: More semisweet than semidry. Grapefruit, pine, orange, lemon, and unrefined grains all play a rôle in the melange, providing a balance with the solid bitterness.  M: Medium bodied with good persistence of carbonation (on swirl test, the head pops right back in place). Not at all boozy, but hits you later.  O: This is my first ever Heddy Topper. I can see why it is the ur-New England IPA, although I gather the brewers originally referred to it as a Vermont IPA. Subtle, delicious, dare I say, fun: I wish this were far more available in my area. A perennial favorite and one can see why.","  rDev 4/21/20...pours dark golden bronze. Patchy white foam sits, a layer remains. Bright, juicy floral nose. Hearty bitter riddled malt. Citrus interwoven. Juicy. Resins. Freshness. Remarkable.","  rDev Picked up a four-pack from Black Cap in Morrisville while heading out of Vermont durimg vacation.  A: Golden straw with a little bit of haze. Topped with a billowing white head that recedes quickly, but leaves sticky lacing.  S: A very nice nose on this one--fresh citrus, soft floral notes, and some resinous woody hints.  T: The flavour has more pine-like qualities, though that same description of  fresh citrus  described in the aroma applies here as well. A tiny bit of sweetness adds to the  juicy  flavour. Quite nice.  M + O: Medium-full body, appropriate carbonatiom, and a smooth, clean finish. Flavours come through moments after a swallow that were not as apparent when sipping. This is quite a tasty NEIPA, well worth the purchase. Now that the review is down, the rest can be finished from the can!","  rDev 16 oz can, canned 6/10/20. Pours hazy dark yellow with a medium meringue white head that retains fairly well and leaves a little lacing.  The aroma is fruit with resiny piney hops that are slightly catty.  The flavor is some wheat malt with sugary fruit and a big resiny ashy bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.  Overall, a nice NE DIPA, but not quite the mind blowing experience I was expecting. Too much catty, ashy, dank hops.","  rDev 16 ounce CANNED 06/09/20 (19 days ago) partially poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 8% ABV. The first half of the can pours hefe-hazy in a peachy, golden color with off white head. The head recedes slowly to a rocky 3/8  cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma from the can is mildly dank, citrus rind and pine. From the glass it's much more dank. First sip from the can is deep green evergreen, earthy, citrus peel and substantial pale malt with no sweetness. From the glass it's similar with the sharp, green lead, but I find it harder to pick up the supporting cast. Bitterness is substantial. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish, despite the ridiculous amount of hop stickiness. Overall, excellent. I'm rarely moved by an IPA these days and actively avoid NEIPA all together. This is just a fantastic DIPA. Thank you so much @beergoot!","  rDev Two weeks old! I poured it into a glass, in spite of the instructions. I was surprised how clear the beer was, considering it’s role in kicking off the haze craze. Tremendous foaming, with incredible head retention. The aroma is surprisingly subdued, with more pith and piney notes coming across while sipped. Drying finish, noticeably bitter.","  rDev Poured out of a 16 oz can. Dated 6/9/20, so a touch over 2 weeks at time of review.  Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange color with two fingers of a pillowy, dense off-white head that dissipates slowly. Remember this one being slightly hazier when I last had this 6 or 7 years ago. Still looks great.  Aroma brings a nice rounded juiciness. Sweet floral, ruby red grapefruit, lemon candy, clementine, slight pineapple, pine resin. Some honey, light caramel, and light breadiness coming from the malt to round it all out.  Taste echos the aroma quite well, along with the addition of a significant herbaceous dankness and bold pine resin bitterness. Sweet floral, lemon hard candy, navel orange, ruby red grapefruit, lemon zest, slight pineapple, slight ripe mango, herbaceous dankness, and a bold pine resin bitterness that lasts on the palate after the last sip and balances the honey, slight caramel, and bread from the malts. A decent dryness accompanies the bitterness, but there’s some slight fruity residual sweetness hanging around. Nicely balanced and complex.  High medium body. Very soft, somewhat creamy, slick, oily, and slightly sticky.  This one stands the test of time. Hard to believe this one is one of the main inspirations for the NE style given what that style has come to in recent years. The rounded juiciness in the aroma and at the front and middle of the palate, as well as the soft feel certainly play into the NE style. However, overall this one reminds me more of a west/east coast hybrid by today’s standards. A damn good one at that. Outstanding DIPA.","  rDev L:. I drank most of this beer out the can as instructed but poured a little bit in a glass to see what I looked like. Pours a strong slightly hazy golden yellow with a small white head and no lacing.  S:. Lots of ripe tropical fruit, lemon orange, lime grapefruit, mix with a nice piney hop, smells very inviting and makes me excited to drink it.  T:. Grapefruit, lemon rind, lemon candy orange, followed up by a nice piney punch and a medium bitterness, every sip makes me want to take another.  F: Creamy medium to big body.  O:. Most of the time these really hyped up beers don't meet my expectations, but while this one was different than I expected, it still is an absolutely fantastic beer.","  rDev L - Golden, opaque, not hazy, great lacing, and great sticky foam head.  S - Really great tropical/pine aromas - across the spectrum, but not  one thing  about the aroma really stood out. on both aroma and taste, it reminds me of a slightly more focused and pungent Ninja vs Unicorn beer. Now, with time, I'm EDITING this to include that the white grape/dank/blueberry aspect is more notable from the can. So up that score. T - Solid grapefruit, good concentration of hop oils, dankness, some pineapple, creamier than I expected. No hop or alcohol burn whatsoever. Like Pliny the Elder of the NEast. F - Good carbonation, good palate impression across the board. Solid. O - a very good DIPA, but not the best I've ever had. I get the love for it, but not sure it's  all that  for me. Might have preferred FOcal Banger just a bit more. From the can, poured into glass (!), 6.3.20 canning date.","  rDev Revisited January 28th, 2022  Golden yellow body, mildly hazy; fantastic, slow-rising carbonation; thick, white, sculpted head, fairly dense and sticky; light rings of foam encircle the glass. Outstanding citrus aroma; orange and white grapefruit; faint note of malt. Prominent bitterness in the taste; moderate citrus presence, lemon, pineapple and grapefruit; mild biscuit-like malt flavor. Moderately heavy body; alcohol dryness with a light citrus bite.  This sample is not much different from my 2020 review. Strong bitterness is to the fore with a nice, rounded citrus profile.  Pouring temperature: 48 °F; canning data: 01-17-22  --------------------------  Original June 18th, 2020 ratings and review  4.75 4.5 4.75 4.5 4.5 (overall 4.62)  Mildly hazy, nearly clear gold body; superb carbonation; head is thick, soapy, sticky, and lasting; subsequent pour from the can leaves and denser, creamier head. Pungent and dank aroma; pine and citrus notes duking it out with some floral suggestions. Outstanding mild malt sweetness; bold hop resinous nips the tongue; honey; boozy undercurrent. Heavy body; soft and pillowy nature offset with a sharp alcohol presence; lightly sticky; comes across as dry overall.  A surprise local purchase, canned 06/03/20. The beer's appearance and even taste reminds me more of a bold west coast IPA than a New England styled beer. If it is in fact a true NEIPA styling, then I wish more brewers would lean towards this direction. Regardless, this is a most satisfying beer.","  rDev Pint can poured into a large wine glass. Pours a nice hazed maple with a healthy cap of white foam. Decent retention follows. Nose of spicy and floral hops and some resin, well balanced but not exactly in your face as you do need to seek it out which would not be an option while drinking from the can. More reminiscent of a traditional DIPA in profile than a fruit bomb.  Taste follow with a peppery spice character, a firm level of carbonation and a pleasant malt backdrop that cloaks the ABV with some finesse. Finish and feel are solid as well with a bounty of hop spice, some citrus notes and a nice prickly carbonation. Overall pretty legit yet not what I expected from the grand daddy of the style, more of bridge builder than a builder of walls.","  rDev Poured from fridge temp. Pours a semi-transparent yellow with a good amount of white head. Nose is nice grapefruit and some tropical fruit, a nice amount of resin, wheat, and a bit of grass. Taste is surprisingly subtle - definitely a good amount of hoppy notes, orange and grapefruit peel bitterness, and maybe a hint of lactose. Really smooth and amazing. Mouthfeel is dry and fairly light.","  rDev A perfect beer. That concluded my review in early April. Now an explanation. I know I risk banishment from The Heady Topper Appreciation Society for this, but I poured a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. I could throw BA under the bus here, since it is hard to judge the looks of a beer from inside a can. Truth be told, I know beer ships best inside a can, but nothing enhances a flavorful beer like a wide open glass vessel. It looks a lot like liquid gold with a perfect and lasting head. A saliva producing sweet and hoppy aroma dominates the vicinity of the cracked can and receptive mug. It laces the mug from top to last gulp. I still have never tasted such a perfect combination of sweet malty starches and a perfectly bitter hop finish. All this and an 8% ABV that just slides down the gullet and provokes you to look for more.","  rDev 16 oz can poured (I know) into a tulip pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with floaties, chunks, etc. Not pretty at all. Piney, bitter, some citrus. Not nearly as  drinkable  as a NEIPA which is kind of what I was expecting. I enjoyed the second can I had (consumed two weeks later) more than the first, possibly because I had a good idea what to expect.","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed May 2013.  A top-notch, extreme hoppy beer, one of the most flavourful I've had. World class. ","  rDev Thanks to yllib for fresh can.  Mostly drank out of can. Visualized a little in glass toward the end.  Dark yellow hazy but could probably still see through it somewhat.  Smell is overwhelming grapefruit. Piney notes.  Taste is truly a fresh hop extravaganza. Just pushing the limit of bitterness and balance. Little malty sweetness involved.  Thicc body.  Overall a nice neipa. Glad to have got to try it.","  rDev Copper colored with a very hazy complexion. There’s a quarter inch of off white on top. The aroma is of grassy to piney hops. I’m tasting grassy to vegetal to piney hops. The mouth is exceptionally smooth, quaffable and beckons further sips.","  rDev Taking the advice of the can and leaving it in, so I’ll go with the general consensus that it looks pretty good  The nose absolutely juicy as can be, with fresh hop and tropical fruit notes coming in waves, it is inviting me to taste it  The taste is a lovely balance of hop bitterness and flavor, mostly tropical notes with a bit of floral hints. The malt smooths this all out and creates a wonderful balance  Going down this feels absolutely incredible, the quick carbonation helps along the rather heavy body, making it just dance on the tongue for a bit before the swallow, with a piney, hop forward aftertaste  I was going back and forth with my expectations leading up to trying this beer, but I eventually just let myself try it while attempting to throw any pre judgement out the window, and it absolutely stands up to everything I’ve heard. There’s no canned date, but it was a gift purchased some time back, and I cannot wait to try this at the source. Absolutely fantastic beer to try at least once, very happy I have 7 left","  rDev Graciously provided by a friend, who was able to get this off eBay. We split a can in glasses. Of course it poured out quite hazy, milky, with a nice head and a peach colored glow. The nose was very nice, full of pineapple, mango and peach with some pine. The mouth feel was nice, smooth, full-bodied and soft with medium carbonation. The taste was a recap of the aroma with lots of tropical fruit and Pine. Bitterness was medium firm. The aftertaste had a bit of lingering malts which was nice. Not totally dry. No off flavors or aromas.  I am glad to have tried this. I understand it’s high regard because it was one of the first hazy ipa’s, however Michigan has M 43 and Bells official, both of which are very comparable. In fact I prefer Bells official to this., especially considering the price.","  rDev Purchased two four-packs of 16 oz cans at brewery in Stowe, VT. Served in 12 oz snifter. Reviewed 7/27/19. Appearance – 4.5. First pour – Light yellow, clear. Body – Yellow, hazy. Head – Enormous (Maximum eleven cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, medium density, stabilizing at 6.5 cm, slooowly diminishing to a thick, cratered cap resembling a lunar landscape. Large, three-dimensional foam islands hang from the inside of the glass.  Lacing – Decent – mostly a continuation of the isolated foamy islands above. Aroma – 3.75 – Herbs and resin, perhaps a weak grape or apricot. Flavor – 4.25 – Begins moderately bitter and resiny with distinctly no melon, fruit, or pine. Ends markedly bitter with a long hang-time. No alcohol taste or aroma (8 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.  Palate – 3 – Medium, almost creamy, lively carbonation. Impression and interpretation – 4.25 - (-0.25 points for undated individual serving container.) I must admit I was unimpressed. Perhaps I was expecting too much from the number one NEIPA. The appearance was excellent so no disappointment there. The aroma was OK but was markedly lacking in fruitiness. The flavor was also OK, but again fruitiness was lacking. The palate was just what is expected from a NEIPA. Overall, a decent NEIPA but I won’t be driving back to Stowe except to revisit von Trapp."]},{"Name":"Sculpin","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/199/29619/","Brewery":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.00,"Score":97.0,"Comments":["  rDev Canned 1/25/21  This is one of those beers that I had for the first time very early on in my craft journey but never reviewed. From what I remember of my 21st, I had a lot of this and the grapefruit variant, and kinda just stopped going back to them after that. Not for any particular reason, but I started branching out since I had the options. So when I saw this and the grapefruit one lying around recently, I just had to pick them up, even though they were older cans they deserve a proper review  Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  Despite the age on the can, this is still in your face hoppy and fresh, which is really what drew me to this beer more than anything when I first had it. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy hops, pithy grapefruit, coriander, lemon rind, biscuity malt, and light caramel  As I said, I recall the aroma being the high point, and the taste lagging a bit behind, but in this case I think it's the age showing a bit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting pine sap, bready malt, white pepper, pithy grapefruit, and peach. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, and toasted grain  A light medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a slick yet firm beer. Finishes off dry and feels much lighter than the 7% it actually is  This beer is an institution for a reason. An absolute classic which holds up today, but I can only imagine what it was like for people to experience this one in the early days. A treasure of a beer that I think I'll have to come back to more often","  rDev 12oz bottle. No dating information found on label nor on bottle. Clear, deep gold colored body. Active uprising bubble show. One finger of white head, which settles back to a medium cap. Leaves bands of lacing. Aroma of hops expressing tropical fruits and lemon. Firm malt base. Taste is old school bitter (70 IPUs). Sweet honey malts. Hops express apricot, peach, and mango, plus some lemon rind. Medium mouth feel. Excellent carbonation. This was a major star when the bitter West Coast IPA was in vogue. Now more of a reminder of this IPA style, but well made and crafted.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, from the Norwegian importer. ABV is 7%. Deep golden colour, nearly clear, moderate white head. Pleasant aroma of fruity hops (citrus, tropical fruits), also notes of pine. Distinct hoppy flavour on a background of slightly sweet malts, notes of grapefruit, pine needles and resin. Bitter finish, very bitter aftertaste.","  rDev Taken from a 40° F 'fridge and allowed to stand for a few minutes before pouring from the 12 oz can into a 20 oz Belgian tulip glass.  Crystal clear golden amber, moderately effervescent, capped by a tall, white head with a slightly yellow tint. The head exhibits descent retention and nice lacing.  Aroma is not too strong, but strong enough to pick up the inviting citrus rind and grapefruit. As the beer warms, I also pick up more tropical fruit aromas, pineapple, others - apricot perhaps?  The citrus rind hits first in the flavor, along with the grapefruit. It transitions in the middle to a slightly sweet malty / bready flavor before resuming the rind bitterness in the finish. The aftertaste leaves a pleasant bitterness on the tongue. As with the aroma, more complexity to the flavor emerges as the beer warms, and in addition to the tropical fruits, the underlying body becomes a bit sweeter. But, the bitter aftertaste remains throughout.  The feel is moderate for the style, with a bit of smoothness to go with the bitter.  Overall, an excellent IPA, and better balanced with a more complex flavor profile than I was expecting.","  rDev 12oz can poured into a snifter  A- pours a clear golden color with a one-finger foamy white head that has great retention long after the pour  S- piney and citrusy hop aromas give notes of orange peel and grapefruit, as well as a hint of grass &amp; pine resin. Toasted malt undertones  T- bold citrusy hop notes of grapefruit zest and tangerine, followed by pine resin, peach &amp; apricot. Toasted malt adds a bit of balance, more zesty citrus on the linger  M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a crisp finish   O- a straight up, classic, solid west coast ipa","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed November 2013.  Bursting with citrusy hop flavours like clementine, grapefruit, and lemon. Juicy-oily mouthfeel with a resiny, drying, lightly bitter finish. Exemplary West Coast IPA. ","  rDev A good looking IPA . Thick, creamy head and nice lacing. Righteous aroma. The taste is good up front and a bit bitter on the back end. Smooth as silk on the mouthfeel. Overall a good IPA. On draft at Witten’s Bar and Grill.","  rDev DATE: December 29, 2019... OCCASION: two days from The Rise of Skywalker, we continue preparing with Return of the Jedi... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... the very picture of the genre: a golden amber body, busy as a city with its active effervescence, building a finger's worth of thick clumps of snow white head... this sits nobly and staunchly for the duration of the drink... lemon, grapefruit and mango build a tropical profile, with pineapple and aromatic flowers creating an inviting allure... its secondary scents include sweet bread malts and light peppery spiciness... its body is hearty, smooth and agreeable... at 7% ABV, it finds the sweet spot between drinkable and weighty, drawing heavily on the back end while biting at the teeth with a robust presence... the crunch and chewiness requisite to an IPA is also on full display here--again, if an alien asked what a good west coast IPA was, this is what you would hand it... pineapple, lemon, mango, and citrus fruits collide in a crunchy, resinous drip... strong presence of toasted malts make this a balanced affair--or as balanced as this hop-heavy ale could be... the pepper makes this a bit more nuanced as well... considering its weight and flavor, this could be an every night beer... planning for a gluten-free January, this was one I found hard to believe that I had not sipped it for posterity here.... thanks to Dave and Jen, another great one crossed off the list...","  rDev 12 oz bottle pours copper color, citrus hoppy aroma, nice hop profile, very nice foamy clingy head. Juicy grapefruit-citrus flavors, medium bodied IPA with a nice rounded full mouthfeel, this may be the most drinkable IPA I have ever tasted, It's hard to stop at just one.","  rDev Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. Hazy dark orange colored body, with a thick snow-white head that took some time to settle. At approximately six months past its bottling date, this sample was a bit malt-forward on the nose and palate. Even so, quite nicely balanced. Notes of pine, grapefruit, and mango sit atop the light caramel malt base. Medium bodied, well attenuated, good carbonation, and a mostly dry finish. Not too boozy for the ABV. Makes a fine pairing with spicy Chinese food. Review is subject to revision, once I locate some freshies.","  rDev Unknown vintage; drank 11/21/14 @ the Yarchives.   Drank straight from the can; no visual cues.   Grapefruit &amp; orange citrus nose.   Thin mouthfeel.   Orange, grapefruit &amp; lemon citrus flavors, plus fresh water.   A hint too tart on the grapefruit notes &amp; a touch too thin, but still a nice, citrus forward IPA.","  rDev This is definitely one of my go to beers. If, your not a fan of WCIPAs? You won't like it.  Cloudy looking with a nice head. Smells if tropical fruits, citrusy and not too sweet. If....? You can find this on draft? It is quite the treat!","  rDev Poured from a can into a tulip.  Pours a crystal clear honey-gold with a two finger head, good cling and lacing.   Strong fruit and malt aromas are forward--mango, peach, pineapple, and faint citrus. Hints of grape must, grass/floral, and dank. The flavor is nice, but subdued.  The flavor like the nose is fairly fruit forward, with just a bit more citrus in the foreground. Grapefruit flesh and zest and peach/mango on the tip of the tongue, with crackery malts, then the bitterness joining the show at mid-palate with some floral notes. Solid resin and dank hop at the tail end. A nice west-coast flavor, with plenty of hop-forward goodness.  The mouthfeel is solid. Good carbonation and lift. Despite the strong malt presence, there is a nice dry finish, and this brew is very drinkable.  A very solid representative of the style.","  rDev Slightly thin body with about medium carbonation.  Aroma is grapefruit,orange and grapefruit peel. Mostly citrus rather than bitter hops Taste is identical to aroma, mostly orange/ grapefruit citrus with mild bitterness there's no pine or extreme bitterness which makes this incredibly easy to drink","  rDev De Espuma - Tienda de Cerveza. En copa Teku. Jugando a Avernum 6. Bastante amargota, con notas citricas y pinaceas. Limpia en boca, aunque algo jabonosa, con cierto aire industrial. Largo retrogusto amargo","  rDev Not sure what all the fuss is about, it seemed kind of weak to me, almost like a session IPA. Orange amber body with decent rocky head. Normal IPA/hop aromas, taste also, and somewhat subdued, less hoppy than a NW IPA. Good, but not great.","  rDev On tap at the Bier Markt - Square One. Served cold into a pint glass. Review from notes.  Appearance - Clear dark amber colored brew, a half finger of off-white head sits on top and lingers for most of the beer. Good clarity.  Smell - A tropical aromapalooza with grapefruit being most prominent, but lemon, melon and pineapple making guest appearances. A very fine IPA aroma.  Taste - Pretty good as well with the grapefruit being the showstopper and a touch of melon and pineapple (with strawberry momentarily?) mid sip. Taste finishes very bitter with lemon and grapefruit and some piney flavors seeping through. A touch too bitter for the sake of being bitter to my tastebuds.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, expressive carbonation, fine dry finish. Here and on the nose is why I see this is absolutely considered a world class IPA.  Overall - Really enjoyed my experience with Sculpin, would love to try a fresh bottle or on a beach somewhere much south of here, see how it stacks up.","  rDev Tasted from a 12 oz bottle bought in Oxnard, CA.  L - Hazy but bright with a golden-orange color; it almost looks like a witbier. Head is off-white in color and not very impressive in initial size or persistence.   S - Aromas of huge citrus (mostly grapefruit) and tropical fruits to a lesser extent. There is a nice cracked grain note and some bready malt in the background.   T - Sharp, almost sour, hops flavors hit initially, with lots of grapefruit juice character. These same sharp citrus flavors stretch through the mid-palate and into the finish and aftertaste. Along the way there is just a bit of grainy malt.  F - Medium body. Low to moderate carbonation. Very strong, bracing bitterness from the hops. Low alcohol warmth. Dry finish.  0 - I find this a nice West Coast IPA, but in my opinion it is a bit one-dimensional with the grapefruit-character hops and little else. Not a lot of malt to offset, or any kind of depth of flavor.","  rDev 2/17/18: 16 oz draft pour into Flamingo plastic cup in their poker room. Mild carbonation, blond pour, minimal white lacing. Pine citrus aroma, taste consistent with aroma, heavy bitterness, very pleasant. Nice firm mouth feel, medium body, fizzy carbonation holds. Overall very good IPA.","  rDev Very pleasantly surprised by this IPA - lives up to its reputation. Smooth orange-yellow color, moderate head, crisp citrus notes with grapefruit and orange. Finishes mildly bitter but much less harsh than the usual IPA offerings. Crisp mouthfeel with decent carbonation throughout.","  rDev Bright shimmering gold color with good white cap and lasting lacing.  Aroma of sharp hops with touches of ripe tropical fruits and lemon.  Flavor is assertively hoppy and if this is what you want you got it. The taste is similar to the scent but with a lot more resin influence riding on a solid malt base. Very complex group of flavors that work well together.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  It has a lot of hop flavor, I'll give it that. Overall a hallmark beer.","  rDev Last beer of the night, Sculpin IPA from Ballast Point, ABV 7.00%. The can says  dedicated to the craft , which is why they sold out to constellation. Well seriously it is still a very good IPA, I just wish everybody wouldn't be selling out.  Look: semi-clear, almost clear, golden with an inch white head, nice lacing.  Aroma: citrus, tropical fruit, pine resin  Taste: It is sweet, fruity, mango, citrus, and significant pine, a very nice but slightly bitter flavor.  Feel: medium bodied, fairly easy drinking","  rDev Well, not sure if my rating is due to an old can (dates on the can are not obvious) or this is one to have on tap, but I cannot justify a higher rating. Poured into a pint glass. Disappointing head, decent lacing. A subdued citrus smell. Pleasant bitterness. Will need to try again, but this is an honest rating for what is in my glass.","  rDev If I'm reading the date on the can correctly this should be a very fresh one but the aroma and taste do not suggest that this is the case. So either this is a fresh can that has been exposed to extreme conditions or the labeling format is misleading and ambiguous. This beer looks nice with a clear amber appearance and with a nice two finger head that does not last for long however. The nose is fairly malty, with some piney hops to provide some balance. The taste is also malty, with some bitterness late on. Some caramel and toasty notes but as far as hops are concerned it's just bitterness they contribute.","  rDev Poured into a chalice: color is straw gold, a slight dense quality, not hazy just not clear - pretty spot on for an ipa. Head is brighter off white with fine to medium sized bubbles, head presents 1/2 inch thick and lingers very well.   Smell is citrus rind, dominant, then light clean pale malt.  Taste has slightly more maltiness, citrus/grapefruit/earth like hoppiness pervades. Just well constructed, simple but hoppy flavor.   Mouthfeel is moderate, with good carbonation, great bitterness, and just enough sweet balance.  Overall a very good IPA - simple, hoppy, bitter, no extraneous flavors.","  rDev From the growler, it pours a solid amber with a nice head. Some lacing as you enjoy it. Pine and grapefruit in the nose. The mouth gets a nice modest bitterness that follows the nose. Nice!","  rDev Hazy copper color with a small head and a little lacing. Smells of citrus, pine and dark fruit. Has pine and citrus flavors, nothing is over done it all blends together very well. Solid IPA for sure.","  rDev Poured from a bottle date coded of 10/16/16 into the modified tulip glass. A - Wonderful clarity, Golden backdrop, provides lovely cover for carbonation, A big snow white cap tops it all off S - Grapefruit, lemongrass, sweet malts delightful, pine notes well crafted T - Honey drop, 2 row and some Cara all in proportion, Nice hop schedule F - Medium in body, great carbonation keeps it clean, excellent finish O - A wonderful IPA, much praise has been made and justly so. Cheers","  rDev Golden appearance with a pleasant hoppy aroma. The taste was much better than most IPAs I have tried. It is slightly fruity which is a big plus. I would recommend it to both IPA lovers and non-lovers","  rDev Sculpin IPA brewed by Ballast Point Brewing Company, with an ABV of 7.00% This IPA pours out a golden amber color with a small white head. There is also a nice cloudy tint to Sculpin IPA. Sculpin IPA is an unfiltered brew you can not see though this IPA. The smell of Sculpin IPA, is nice with hops, grains and malts. You also pick up on a mild sweetness in the smell of this brew. The smell is really inviting. There is also a fair amount of lacing to this IPA. Now for the taste, it is bold with hops at first. Then it smooths out with sweet grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Sculpin IPA . This IPA had the look, smell and taste of most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. What sets this IPA form the others is how smooth it is. Sculpin IPA has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew. The month feel of Sculpin IPA is, Rich, Bold, Clean Smooth and Refreshing. I really how bold this brew is however it goes down nice and smooth. Overall I'm giving Sculpin IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. If you are a fan of IPA's look this brew up.

Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink despite very resinous bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering.","  rDev Having this on-tap. This beer draws a pretty clear, medium golden color with a bit of an orange hue and a white head that's about half an inch thick when first drawn and served. Head settles to a medium sized to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some bits of foam on the beer's surface. Aromas of slightly toasted caramel malt notes along with mango, melon, and citrus hops. The taste is pretty much the same, with slightly toasted caramel malt sweetness that gives way to mango, melon, and citrus hop bitterness that also has a bit of an earthy note to it. Good balance of flavors here. Has a mainly crisp, slightly smooth and frothy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish. easy to drink in the good way.

Overall, a very good beer.","  rDev This beer is a perfect pour from the large format bottle at refrigerator temperature into the Duvel tulip, it is a rich, chocolate brown, viscous-looking delight with an ample tan/brown head that lasts forever, never quite falling completely even as the beer warmed.  The smell is at first chocolate-dominant, but as it warmed up the rest of the team came to play. Coffee, ample bourbon barrel notes, and the malt isn't hidden - you can still smell a strong contribution from the roasted malts. As the beer warms, the aroma just explodes - a variety of chocolate-like aroma, fresh-brewed coffee that seems espresso-like, caramel, brown sugar/molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and just a hint of boozy alcohol that is otherwise quite well and deceptively hidden.  The taste developed in a similar fashion - chocolate at first with the coffee and bourbon coming in behind. But this opens up with warmth just as the aroma did becoming a multi-layered taste experience. It's deep, rich, and complex. Yet it is not so complex that you can't just sip and enjoy if you turn off trying to analyze it. Everything comes through and is discernible, then it's gone and you need to go back for another sip. For all the intense flavor this carries, it is not cloying and overpowering - somehow to me it is still a  clean , unmuddied flavor overall. The bitter and sweet is on point and completely balanced, as are all the flavors - there's nobody sticking out as it is all fantastically blended.  The feel is smooth and silky with just a bit of chalkiness. There's enough bitter to notice, but it doesn't carry over with much of an aftertaste. The carbonation is low to moderate - just enough to liven the beer just ever so slightly and not interfere. Slightly drying on the finish.  Overall this is a tremendous beer that delivers wave after wave of aroma and flavor to just sit and enjoy. The changes on warming were particularly enjoyable. The ABV is well-disguised and this beer could really sneak up on the unprepared!","  rDev DATE: April 21, 2020...

Bourbon / vanilla notes, along with lots of roasted malt that brings some bitterness to complement everything. Despite being so thick, this is not a malt bomb, nor is this bourbon with some beer flavor.

Somehow I'd never had a chance to try it before, but I am certainly glad I finally did. A classic beer that truly lives up to its own hype.","  rDev I should start this off by saying that stout are not one of my favorite styles, but holy hell is this good. Huge shoutout to CraftBeerKings.com for making it possible for me to try this, and it was on sale!  Bottled 2/11/19  From a 12 oz 2019 bottle into a snifter, it pours an opaque black with a brown tan head that holds up for quite a while  The aroma strongly coffee and dark malts, almost overly sweet at times. But the coffee here smells genuine with a smokiness to back it up  This brew comes alive in the taste as it warms while it sits in my mouth. Chocolate malts coat my tongue initially while a coffee and oak presence finish it out. There are very mild fruity esters I am picking up on, perhaps plums  The feel here is exceptionally smooth, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. After the swallow, notes of oak and coffee remain for a long while  Overall, this brew is incredible and lives up to the hype, especially for someone such as myself who wold much prefer an ipa or a sour over a stout any day. It is not overly complex, but it flows well because of this. The flavors, aroma, and mouthfeel all interact nicely to create a very cohesive stout. I paired this with a wedge of gouda cheese that helped bring out more of the coffee notes than it had initially, and I strongly recommend that pairing. If this is still available on CBK for $4.99 a bottle, do yourself a favor and pick a few up if you've never tried it.

More bourbon to taste thsn anything else on the palate, but nicely tempered by chocoladepand given a little more depth by the coffee made part of the mix. Again, sweet but not syrupy. Drinks like a liquer. Tasty and delicate on the palate. Would make an excellent after dinner brew for sipping at.  Interesting across the board. Not everyday stuff, just something as an occasional treat. Could even be shared around in liquer glasses. Enjoyable.","  rDev First sampled in 2018, but this 2019 version will be my first to be (officially) reviewed.  Bottled on 3/5/19  Pours a gorgeous, thick jet black body topped with a creamy light brown head; decent retention yields a heavy collar of bubbly froth and some light but persistent lacing coating the walls of the glass.  Aromas of huge mocha, baker’s chocolate, and some general brownie batter tones upfront; oaky, ashy char, tobacco, brown sugar, coffee candy, and molasses all ease their way forward as the beer warms; seems almost overwhelmingly chocolatey at times, but the building bourbon and barrel hint at a further depth.  Taste brings more dark chocolate, oak, and a deeper hint of smoke malt to start; bourbon depth begins to reveal itself as it warms, with light vanilla and wisps of espresso playing for attention, but the depth of chocolate here is intense and indomitable; in spite of this, it’s a perfect kind of sweetness executed against relatively quiet barrel tones.  Mouthfeel verges on heavy, but shows a tamed body eased by the lightest kind of carbonation; bits of malty grit along the mid-palate build steadily, eventually resulting in an amazingly dry finish that subdues the weight of the profile nicely.  This 2019 iteration is very oak-forward with an intense chocolate profile that threatens to overwhelm the beer entirely, although the depth coming through the borderline one-dimensionality is impressive, all things considered, and there’s an overall refinement that makes this consistently easy to enjoy; a BA stout done at a high level, simply put.","  rDev First had poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped “Bottled on 03.05.2018,” gift from friend, into snifter.  They don’t get much bigger than this, in malt and ABV. But while the alcohol is over the top, the chocolate, coffee and whiskey are not. This absolutely black beer has a big continuing aroma of rich malts, chocolate and bourbon, and is even more complex on the palate, with sweet bourbon, smooth coffee, malts, and chocolate, before a heated alcohol finish. The overall effect is rather like drinking a fine liqueur (after the half-finger dark tan head drops out).","  rDev Poured from a single-serve bottle into a tulip.  I am glad we finally have this brew available on the barren prairie. I can't believe I've not tasted this one before.  Pours a thick, viscous, absolutely opaque black/brown with dark mottled tan two-fingered head, which lingers well for the ABV and good lacing. A very fine looking imperial stout.   A very strong, complex and pleasing aroma is delivered here. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, anise/herb notes, along with caramel, roasted grain, nutty background aromas (hazelnuts and walnuts). Graham cracker, molasses and hints of booze, rather well-hidden for the ABV.  The flavors of this brew are varied, complex, and tasty. The bourbon/vanilla notes are, obviously, pretty strong and solid, but they are part of a collection of flavors, not the only show. Coffee, chocolate cake batter, semi-sweet chocolate nibs, char, fig, date, hazelnut, anise, molasses, oak, tobacco, leather, and broader non-bourbon booziness join the party.   Barrel-aged offerings of anything are often skewed  thin  for the style that was aged--not so this offering. The mouthfeel is medium full, with solid carbonation for the style and ABV. The finish is just so--no stickiness or sweetness.   Barrel-aging has always been a hit or miss for me. This is one of the best barrel-aged brews I've had. I'm glad I finally had the chance to taste this well-regarded brew.","  rDev I am rather incredulous that I have not reviewed this beer until now! I have had multiple vintages, but the one currently in my possession is absolutely fresh as a 2019 release.   From the Bottle:  The Amazing Kosmicki's KBS ;  A flavored Stout is good for everything a flavored Stout ought to be good for ;  Ale brewed with Chocolate and Coffee [and] aged in Oak Bourbon Barrels ;  Barrel Aged Series ;  What we’ve got here is an imperial stout brewed with a massive amount of coffee and chocolates, then cave-aged in oak bourbon barrels for an entire year to make sure wonderful bourbon undertones come through in the finish. Makes your taste buds squeal with delight.   I wouldn't mind squealing with delight so I Pop!ped the cap &amp; began a slow, gentle pour into the awaiting glass. The beauty of a Stout, in any form, even if it is CO2-driven, is that they tend to perform a pseudo-cascade, leading to the formation of loads of head. In this case, I wound up with over two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with very good retention that left loads of lacing in its wake. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled prevalently of baker's chocolate &amp; bourbon with an undertone of dark-roasted black coffee. Mmm. The taste, while delicious, lacked the subtleties that I have noticed in aged vintages. For example, the bourbon brought an unsubtle heat to the equation and thereby masked especially the coffee while it muted the chocolate. That is not to say that I did not enjoy its taste - simply that I feel that it improves with age. The heat brought a dryness to the finish that aging seems to buff off. I am glad that I finally reviewed it, but I still recommend aging before drinking. YMMV.","  rDev From the growler via Jungle Jim's in a snifter. This legend pours a  blackish brown with a very nice head of tan foam that subsides to  a thick ring, thin layer, and sports some rather nice lacing. Nose of  deep coffee, subtle boozy bourbon, and heavy char with touches of  vanilla and bakers chocolate. Flavors surpass the nose with light bourbon  and heavy roasted coffee with a heavy handed dose of charred malt with  light vanilla and hints of cream with a lightly bitter hop note with  warmth as well as large doses of bakers chocolate. Nice mouth  feel; full body, light carbonation, and a heavy char  and bitter cocoa coffee finish that is slick and lightly warming.  Overall, a SOLID brew from a great brewery.   Cheers","  rDev Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter  A: Pours nearly black with a dense frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves some nice lacing.   S: Roasty, lots of coffee, chocolate, dark sugar, bourbon, vanilla, a bit earthy and spicy, and a touch of oak.  T: Roasty, big dark chocolate and coffee, nice touch of bourbon, dark sugar, vanilla, slight spicy and earthy notes, and faint oak, with a touch of alcohol poking though.  M: Full body, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy, a touch of warmth. Holds its % very well.   O: Had a couple of sips of this one before, and have a couple bottles aging in my cellar, but made it a point to get some as fresh as possible to see how it is straight out of the barrel.   Opens up nicely as it warms. Really nice fresh, maybe a few slightly rough edges. I'm definitely going to pull out a bottle with some age for a comparison. I can only see this one getting better over time.","  2019 Release -- 12.2% ABV  Opaque black and brown body; thick, dense, frothy and sticky head; Well-balanced aroma mingling notes of coffee, roasted and charred grain and elements of dark, bitter chocolate; mocha. Immediate hit of whiskey which quickly dissolves into rich milk chocolate, coffee and caffeine. Heavy body; dense and luscious sense of velvet and residual sugars; warm with lots of boozy heat; semi-sweet.  At long last I get to try some of this beer. I am not disappointed. And compared to the price of Founder's Canadian Breakfast Stout, KBS would be my preferred choice for an epic Founder's imperial stout. The bourbon barrel aging is prominent yet is nicely balanced and offset by the base imperial stout. A wonderful beer that is deserving of its reputation based solely on taste and mouthfeel.","  rDev 2018 edition 12oz bottle. Bottled on date is '02.22.18'. 12.31ABV%. Dark brown colored body, with a medium brown backlit edge. One finger of dark tan head, which shimmers from the rising bubbles. Leaves behind a spotty pattern of lacing. Aroma right away expresses the aromatic nature of the bourbon barrel, and beneath that are the smells of chocolate and coffee. Also caramel and some vanilla are present.  Taste is first the more bitter coffee, and then the rich chocolate flavor arrives, along with the roasty base, some caramel and vanilla. The bourbon barrel encompasses it all but never overwhelms. Toward the end are the more boozy notes. The end trails off with bourbon tinged chocolate and slight coffee. Some light char and smoke in the aftertaste. Ends up with a dry note. Full and creamy mouth feel. Supportive carbonation.  Fully deserving of its accolades, this beer delivers with both a pleasant and a powerful drinking experience. Lots of big time flavors but quite easy to drink. The bourbon barrel is so well incorporated.","  rDev A 12 fl. oz. bottle, bottled on 13th March 2018. Poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: Dark brown to black in colour with a half finger mocha brown head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left some nice lacing.  Aroma: Roasty, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak and a light caramel.  Taste: Roasted malts, lots of rich dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, light bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, full bodied with soft carbonation.  Overall: Aroma wasn’t as rich as the taste, but the taste was outstanding with the strong rich and smooth chocolate flavours. The coffee, bourbon and oak balanced it out very nicely, and it was just a great sipper for a cool winter (or air conditioned) night.","  rDev L: Dark brown color, quarter finger fast dissipating head, messy, thin lacing, no carbonation.  S: Chocolate, coffee. Nice!  T: Chocolate, coffee, sweet, a bit boozy, lots of complexity.  F: Full bodied, full flavored. Lacking a bit in smoothness.  O: A good imperial stout, no doubt. But there are much richer options out there.","  rDev Founders Brewing 'KBS' @ 12.3% served from a 330 ml bottle  A-pour is a dark brown from the bottle to a black in the glass with a small dark tan head leaving a minimal lace along the tulip  S-coffee &amp; chocolate T-BA beer , wow ,  MF-ok carbonation , full bodied beer , pacts a punch Ov-amazing beer , believe the hype  prost LampertLand","  rDev Huge standout Stout.

Hint of coffee  T - Sweet up front, coffee kicks in next and chocolate. Not much of the bourbon notes  F - Medium body and carbonation. Silky smooth  O - A good brew, but the bourbon does not stand out and carry this beer in my opinion. Tastes more like an imperial stout.","  rDev Poured to an Ora et Labora taster.  A: Body is totally black opaque, with a small head that's brown to beige living to the side of the glass. When swirling, it creates a 3mm thick head. S: Aroma is incredible. It starts with vanilla, caramel and then moves to bourbon and ends in dark chocolate with a big smily end. T: Taste starts with vanilla and caramel. It then changes to the slight sweetness of dark chocolate and in between you a boozy blanket of bourbon that's just great. Just like Backwoods, this is a perfect marriage of whisky and beer. M: Body is high. Carbonation is perfect. Alcohol is noticeable but runs at 11.9% ABV. Bitterness is mild and sweetness is also mild, resulting in a beautiful mouthfeel. O: These guys kill it when it comes to marry whisky stuff and beer. It's amazing.","  rDev Thank you, Rkitchen!  Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) brown bottle into a conical pint glass; 2018 release (bottled on 02/21/2018). A: Pours a very, very dark brown color (but not quite black) with excellent formation of a one inch plus, light brown head, moderate retention, but rings and rings of serious lacing. S: Gorgeous nose with aromas of chocolate &gt; coffee (but definitely both), vanilla, frankly very reminiscent of a chocolate ice cream malted. As warms, more of a bourbon note. T: Chocolate and coffee are very evident, with vanilla and bourbon flavors much more evident. Thought I detected orange peel and spicy notes. Aging from oak and higher order alcohols both seem to be present. Bitterness imparts almost a birch or sarsaparilla note. M: Full bodied with solid, very persistent carbonation. Creamy and smooth. O: Wow! If you like stouts and porters, this is for you. Delicious, high quality stout, not much more to say.","  rDev I get it why this is so popular, damn is it good...  This, for the most part, lives up to its hype. There's been other brews I have had that have not, but this one certainly does. From the time I poured it out of the bottle from the time I downed it, it was dark, laced on the pint glass, and did I mention dark...The smell was everything you would expect - boozy, chocolaty, full of the scent of coffee - and that goes for the taste as well. Mouthfeel is something I am rarely impressed with when it comes to beers - but this one was creamy, light on the carbonation (like I like it) and for all the bourbon - smooth. Yes, it was a special experience at the end of a long weekend to sip this and enjoy it."]},{"Name":"Hopslam Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/17112/","Brewery":"Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":10.00,"Score":98.0,"Comments":["  rDev Pours a bright copper with a full head that slowly dissipates.  A broad array of floral and pine hop notes on the nose. The honey, had I not known was there would have been too negligible to notice, but, knowing it is there, my nose picks up a smidgen.  Classically piney/grassy IPA on the tongue with a solid bitterness to finish the sip. The honey shines without adding any unwanted sweetness. Quite good.  Lightly effervescent with a full body.  This is excellent stuff. I’m thrilled to have finally tried a can and would definitely buy it in large numbers were I afforded the opportunity.","  rDev Although previously consumed a review hasn't yet been posted. So, this time, a twelve ounce brown bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It looks good, but not inspiring. The color is a bright and light copper-amber, on the translucent side. There's only a slight head and no glass lacing. The aroma begins to improve expectations, as there's malt, hops and even honey to detect. The taste starts with a good full on earthy malt character. This never gets bitter, but it never gets too sweet. The body is near perfect and the balance of malt to hop is unassailable. That must be quite the accomplishment, since honey is in the mix. A wonderful exchange of sweeter malt and mild hops that 0deliveres a tasteful brew that may disguise its high ABV better than any other. Outstanding.","  rDev Bottled 1/6/21  This is a legendary beer that I honestly haven't paid much attention too. Pretty widely available too, so it's a shame that it's taken me this long to get around to it, but at least I'm having it now! Let's jump into this beast  Pours a lightly cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves patchy lacing, carbonation bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass  There's a definite balance in the nose between fresh, vibrant hops, and sweet chewy malt. I'm picking up on aromas of oily pine, pithy grapefruit, crackery malt, some earthy spice, sweet honey, and grassy hops  The balance continues into the taste, but leans more into the bitter side of things. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh cut pine, tangerine, pale malt, and lemon rind. The swallow brings notes of pale malt, light toast, orange zest, and floral hops  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet dry beer that is quite refreshing for the abv. Finishes mostly dry with aa decent sweetness  While this is good, it did not come anywhere near the average on here. I suspect the high rating reflects much older batches, as I've heard this has changed a lot over the years. Oh well, I'm still happy I had it","  rDev Clear brass, white head, retention is somewhat lacking, spotty lace. Grapefruit, juniper/pine, mango, peach, floral, and dank aromas. Grapefruit, overripe peach, and juniper over a slightly sweet honey and malt background A bit more full than I prefer IPAs, but not sticky, medium light carbonation, clean  There's a reason this has been so popular for so long.","  rDev 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a fairly clear orange copper in color with a thin cap of off white foam. Fair retention though settling to some spottiness.  Bold hop aromas on the nose, coupled with some some honey rich malt notes and a waft of ethanol. Doesn't exactly blast the hops as you gotta get into the glass to find them.  Taste seems a bit muddled with sweetness evident on the finish. Not a whole lot of malt character as honey notes take center stage but do mask the alcohol well. Some citric hop spice on the finish breaks the monotony to a degree and keeps the mouthfeel from being overly cloying given the ABV.   Overall a decent quaff but not what I expected from such a highly lauded brew. We'll see if a little warming improves things. Packaged 1/15/2021 so just two weeks in the bottle.","  rDev Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of pale malt, citrus and mildly grassy hops, orange, grapefruit, mild light stone fruit; faintly floral. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, grapefruit, pine, light stone fruit, hints of tropical fruit; complex and a bit boozy. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess, nice body and mouth feel. I see what all the fuss is about with this IPA. The hopping is West Coast leaning, with lots of citrus and pine, but there is also nice layers of apricot and peach as well as mixed tropical fruit notes. Lingering pine and citrus rind resinous finish with both aggressive hop bitterness and herbal hop flavors. I got this can round-about from California and it is not quite as fresh as I would like, but really still has both depth and intensity of flavor. There were rumors of Bell being distributed in Washington, but I've never seen them. I would happily get this again if it were available; kind of regret that this was only a 12 oz can.","  rDev Tasted on tap at Aces &amp; Ales - Tenaya, in Las Vegas, NV.","  rDev Getting to this famous brew, love the other offerings of Bells.  a) Satisfying. hazy golden/orange bronze, with white head lots of retention and lace.  s) Bigger, flowers and honey tempered by pine hops.  t) Sweet and honeyed while tempered by multi-faceted hops f) creamy, bite falls in balance with the sweet, hides the ABV.  o) Lives up to its storey'd reputation.","  rDev Bell's Hopslam DIPA, 10% ABV.

Smell is light pine, mixed citrus, bready malt, and a sweet floral aroma.  Taste is pine, caramelized bread crust (think toasted raisin bread, or other sweet breads), &amp; a light bit of grass and honey.

The mighty Hopslam! I've heard so much about this beer over the years. Lots of good, lots of bad. And, now that Bell's distributes to NJ, it's time to check it out for myself. Let's dive in!  Great looking beer in the glass. Somewhere in between deep gold and pale amber. Slight haze. Large, frothy, persistent white head that leaves behind a good amount of lacing.  Complex aroma that runs the gamut of hop descriptors. No shortage of grapefruit, pine, and orange. Maybe even some melon too? Sure, why not. Once you get past that, especially as the beer warms, there is this beautiful floral, herbal, earthy aspect to it. Even perfume comes to mind. Really impressive.  Heavy malt and honey sweetness show up in the flavor. The balances really shifts to the malt here and the finish is sweet and bitter.  Medium-full bodied, sticky, and almost syrupy. Slightly warming from the 10% ABV.  This is an old school Imperial IPA. A real blast from the past.","  rDev Pours a mildly hazy amber color with a thick foamy head. Head retention is decent and lacing is good. Aroma is light on the nose but get citrus, caramel, honey, and some pine. Very floral taste with slight caramel and honey finish. Bitter, slightly piney aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very well balanced. Slightly boozy.","  rDev On tap at Verona Inn. Pours a golden, effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Assertive aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Similar overall flavor profile.","  rDev It has tons of citrus and floral hop notes in the aroma. Then the flavor hits with loads of white grapefruit, tangerine and bitter floral hops over pale malt. The finish has some warmth from the alcohol and lingering hop bitterness.","  rDev From the can (packed 1 15 19), it pours a lovely clear amber color with a large, thick head that leaves lacing as you watch. A large amount of hops in the nose, primarily citrus stinging the nose. The mouth is pineapple with a solid malt base. Easy to drink - at 10%, it is pretty dangerous.  2022 Update: Yum!","  rDev a: clear, dark amber color with some real rich caramel notes. 1.5 finger fluffy white head that fades to about 1/2 finger as i'm typing this  s: pineapple, orange, sweet &amp; tangy grapefruit with a juicy punch upfront that makes the mouth water. there is a large biscuity malt backbone behind that, with a hint of subtle caramel. more juicy orange &amp; orange zest, along with a hint of pine. something slightly floral in the aroma here as well  t: sweet and bitter grapefruit upfront, as well as a big punch of sweet caramel malt and honey. pine and sticky resin behind that, as well as a mild herbal tea leaf bitterness. more bitter pine and sweet malts. grapefruit &amp; orange zest towards the need as well. definitely some alcohol tinge in here towards the back of the tongue as well  m: heavier side of medium, very sticky mouthfeel. medium carbonation, with some nice effervescence on the sides of the tongue  o: this is a serious DIPA. it's heavy in flavor and not shy. the bitter is balanced out by some sweet malts &amp; definitely the honey. the way a DIPA should be. no faults in this beer at all. the price tag does seem a bit steep, but people are paying more for 4 packs these days, so it's probably at a fair level for a DIPA","  rDev Pours a ruby-gold color with a foamy head that disappears quickly. Aromas of grapefruit. Tastes of sweet pineapple, honey and grapefruit. Plenty of hop flavor but sweet.","  rDev Canned on 1/10/19  Pours a deep golden burnt orange with a steady white head; higher level retention eventually leaves a formidable wall of semi-thick lacing; a clear, exceptional-looking nectar of a beer.  Aroma brings concentrated notes of ultra-dank pine, herbal sweet malts, pithy grapefruit, a pungent forality, and dank citrus rind; more of a hop-malt balance upfront here, with the bouquet hinting toward an underlying intensity.  Taste hints of dank citrus rind with an intense stream of raw hop resin coursing through the center of the profile onward, and touched by hints of honeyed malt toward the back end; intense, bitter, but excellently balanced by the honey.  Mouthfeel shows an incredibly smooth medium body topped with creamy carbonation; prickly and hugely refreshing resinous tones from the hops build throughout; primarily dry near the finish, but with an almost syrupy slickness faintly in the background adding some depth.  Excellently-crafted heavy hitter of an older style IPA; impressive in its balance of both flavor profile and mouthfeel, as well as a finely-tuned, condensed hop intensity. Spectacular drinkability for a 10%er, too.","  rDev Not impressed. Hop character is completely buried. Not in line with a beer called  hop slam . Honey provides a little character but the beer drinks much too boring, modest, humble for a 10% beer. For 10% and the $20 price I expect it to taste exciting and indulgent. It doesn't. Waste of money.","  rDev Here goes nothing. The highly-vaunted HopSlam finally flows into my glass via a can dated 1/9/19, meaning that not only did Bell's recently get distribution in New England, but they're paying extra-good attention to the dates they get stuff out here by! Now that is how you treat a new market... I feel very lucky to have this beer right now, that's for sure. I've heard so much about it, and now it's finally time to sink my teeth into it.  Pours a slightly-hazy medium-amber/golden color with no notable hop/yeast particulate in the body. Head builds up to about three fingers at first, but eventually it settles to about a half-finger with soapy lace show and medium legs. Surface is pretty much covered in the same foam, but a little less dense. A fairly good pour with an air of classiness to it. It's not crazy, but it's not boring or underwhelming. I approve!  The nose reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada's Hop Bullet, and maybe I'll get some hate for comparing an older beer by a much-loved brewery to a newer IPA from an even-older, maybe-more-well-liked brewery, but that was the first thing that came to mind. Strong tangerine/grapefruit and lemon verbena notes with some catty dankness and pine resin. Slight peach/nectarine with a little suggestion of the honey they used in this one. I have had some excellent honey-infused IPAs over the past year or two, and this is definitely the godfather of such an idea, and it deserves to be appreciated for that! That said, I would like this to be a little more aromatic than it is... it doesn't jump out of the glass quite as much as I'd prefer.  On the other hand, the flavor profile is sticky and super-satisfying. I get a bit of citrusy juiciness right upfront combined with some suggestions of stone fruit, grassy hops, pine-resin stickiness and pithy bitterness toward the finish. The honey is prevalent here, surprisingly enough. It really punches through the semi-heavy body and gives a nice balance to the proceedings. I was assuming it would totally be fermented out, but I was proven wrong... light florals and herbal elements definitely congeal in the mid-to-finish of each sip, lending a very full bodied and complex flavor to this classic. And I now understand why it is considered a classic. It may have been the first commercially-distributed triple IPA, after all. Why isn't that a style on BA...?","  rDev A: Pours a copper color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap  S: A good mix of citrus, floral, and fruity hops along with a light malt sweetness  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and floral hop notes and then picks up some of the residual sweetness from the honey and a bit of booziness. Finishes with lingering grapefruit and floral notes  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A great DIPA that is far too easy to drink for being 10%. One of the classics for a reason","  rDev 12oz can poured into a globe. One week young at the time of consumption!  A: Deep Amber color with good clarity. Rocky white head retains well. Clumpy lacing.  S: Candied lemon, sugared white grapefruit, orange pulp. Grassy with a bit of an earthy/herbal tone too. Clover honey. Caramel and pound cake.  T: Green and oily up front with soft herbal tones and perhaps a touch of scallion. This soon transitions to full blown citrus. Bitter white grapefruit, lemon peel, pulpy orange. Bitterness is firm and clamping, reaching its apex on the back end. Honey, caramel, and pound cake sweetness help to keep it tethered. Brush of alcohol. Honey, orange slices, and some firm bitterness on the finish.  M: Full body with a chewy feel. Definitely some residual sugars. Some heft, but it isn't too weighty. Hop astringency grips at the tooth enamel a little bit.   O: A one-two punch of honey and malt sweetness and citrusy and green hop bitterness. It hits it's balance perfectly. A big beer, but not too hard to drink. This used to be an occasional treat in the rare instances I came across it in my travels in years past. Now it's available in my home market, with impressive freshness! Score!","  rDev 12oz can. Pours a clear brownish orange with an inch of creamy head. Tons of lacing.

Grapefruit and nectarine towards the finish with bread crust, more honey and a finish of tea. Oily mouthfeel. Heavy with a very noticeable alcohol presence.

The taste is outstanding and consists of loads of fruit: grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, mango and passionfruit. There’s also some weaker piney hops, herbal hops, malt, caramel, bread and vanilla. Smooth mild mouthfeel with a little bit of creaminess the coats the palate. Nice carbonation. Outstanding flavors with a great balance between the slightly bitter hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Perfect amount of bitterness at the finish.

Feels medium-full bodied, thick, creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a really great DIPA with honey.","  rDev Canned in January, but I don’t expect for this to have fallen off much as a DIPA.  Pours a deep orange, with a nice three finger head of frothy foam that leaves patches of heavy lace as it settles.  A vibrant array of lemon, grass, and floral hops hit your nose. Fresh honey and light bready malt linger.   The flavors here are really nice. The honey isn’t overwhelming or too sweet, and the bitter, floral hops return and dissolve into a malty finish. A good balance, well done.  Medium body, medium carb.. not too sticky, a little filmy.","  rDev Drinking a 6-pack just prior to the 60 day mark, so it is reasonably fresh. Pours a relatively clear copper orange with medium head that leaves good lace. Nose is not as big as I expected, and has some dank pine and citrus. Taste is more orange rind and some caramel. Obviously a big beer, but holds it well for 10% abv. Overall, I liked it but don’t get the uber high scores here.","  rDev Poured on tap at a bar in Tempe, Arizona.  Pours a clear golden color with a white sheet of head. Leaves zero lacing before the head completely dissipates into nothingness.  The aroma brings notes of pine. That's it. Hey I love a good pine bomb but I also like balance. No honey, no citrus, no tropical fruits. Just pine. A lumberjack wouldn't like this shit.  The taste actually brings some citrus into the mix. There's some oranges and a touch of grapefruit before a wave of chalky aspirin humps my taste buds. There's some malt on the backbone so it gets a point for that. Otherwise, entirely bland and unnecessarily bitter.  The feel is thin with moderate carbonation. It's thin, yet somehow sticky. Solve that one, nerds. Alcohol is barely present which is neat.  Overall, a pretty damn awful DIPA. I don't care how hyped up this beer is, I just didn't like it. I'd gladly give it another chance if I ever got some bottles but other than that I'm not impressed. Hopefully a bad batch."]},{"Name":"Bourbon County Brand Stout","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1146/10672/","Brewery":"Goose Island Beer Co.","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":14.70,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev 16.9 ounce bottle, dated August 11, 2017. 14.1% abv.  Black in color with a cocoa tan cap, rather thin, ample lacing.  Aromas are beautiful; vanilla and caramel, bourbon, charred oak barrel, licorice.  Flavors come as vanilla, chocolate, and a touch of licorice. Smoked whiskey and dark fruits loiter in the background.  Smooth, rich, and strong sipping quality stout.  BCBS, as good as it gets.","  rDev I won't do a traditional review, except to say that this thing is incredibly overrated. Maybe it was better once, before A-B bought bought out Goose Island. I only tried this in the last couple years and it is like rubbing alcohol mixed with equal parts soy sauce, brown sugar, and burned chocolate syrup, all served in a rubber boot. Not great for almost $20 a bottle.   I'd rather have literally any cheap bourbon off the shelf drop shotted into the worst imperial stout available. The emperor wears no clothes","  rDev At Party Town in a flight. 2019, 2020 and 2021 vintage. Pours a pitch black color with a creamy brown head. Aroma of roasted malts and coffee. Taste follows suit with dark chocolate and hints of vanilla and caramel. The '19 had a more oily mouthfeel while the '20 and '21 felt more airy. 12/24/2021 had a bottle of the 2020, flavor had notes of licorice.","  rDev 2021 vintage. Bottled 8/31/21.  Pours pretty much pitch black with less than a finger of dark mocha head that dissipates quickly. When swirling it around the glass, it fully coats it and leaves tons of alcohol legs. Looks like your classic BCBS.  Aroma is also your classic Bourbon County smell, but I get a lot more dark fruit than expected. Almost port wine-like. Blackberry, fig, date, plum, caramel, oak tannin, bakers chocolate, molasses, some oatmeal raisin cookie, tobacco, roasted malt, some vanilla, bourbon.  Taste pretty much follows the nose, elevated dark fruit and all. Blackberry jam, plum, fig, raisin, some caramel, toffee, burnt sugar, charred oak tannin, bakers chocolate, bittersweet chocolate chip, molasses, tobacco, roasted malt, vanilla, fairly smooth bourbon presence but there is some heat as expected fresh. As always, has a nice balance of sweet to dry notes. As it warms, the chocolate, sweeter notes, and barrel come through more, leaving the dark fruit in the background.  High medium body to low full body. Slick, oily, sticky.  Another great vintage as I knew it would be. The consistency year in and year out (other than the nightmare 2015 infected release) is excellent.","  rDev As one of the top beers, this one has some high expectations to live up to. Which it pretty much does all the way.  Very sweet, very aromatic, front heavy on the bourbon and barrel. Dark fruity notes along with chocolate and vanilla.   Rich and thick like diesel oil, lingering bourbon taste.   Definitely worthy of its high status.","  rDev 2020.  14.6%, Drink by 22 Jun 2025.   Pours an impressive black as night body with an even more impressive lasting 2 finger head. I can't believe how much head retention this has. It's not going anywhere. I'll bet they used more oatmeal this time. Due to the head retention at its ABV and barrel aging, I must give this a 5.   The aroma from the bottle is sharp and biting, bringing loads of caramel and almond, with undertones of smoke, blueberries, molasses, cannabis, and dark chocolate. From the glass it's ironically more metallic. Swirling brings that marvelous head back. I can't say enough about it. I still get lots of heavy caramel from the glass and a new note - booze.   Flavor is very different from years' past. Sweeter. A little ruder. Molasses and dark chocolate hit first, with smoke intermingling. Medium palate brings fig and raisin, with slight nuts, a whisper of caramel, and finally a finish of - wait for it - fruitcake. Lingering elements of smoke come out here and there - breaths of what I would call a,  dark chocolate cigar .   Feel is slick and smooth, a little thinner than years' past (perhaps on par with 2016 and 2017), but the oatmeal creaminess is still there. Has a very resinous finish, coats it on thick, much like a Russian Imperial Stout would, with lingering boozy heat and light stickiness.   Overall, another absolute banger in the BCBS anthology - though this one is a bit strange with its fruitcake oddities. I did like 2019 a bit better, and it looks like I skipped a few years with posting my reviews. I'll have to update that as I'm sure I have it written down somewhere. Solid beer, absolutely buy it, but try one bottle before you stock up endlessly on 2020's iteration.   5, 4.5, 4.25, 4.5, 4.5    2016 :  Black of course, no head  Aroma of maple, brown sugar, molasses, fig, and whiskey.  Lots of bourbon and honey sweetness with mild dirt, molasses, and dark cherry.  Feel is thinner than last year with some serious burning.  Last year's was better but this ain't no slouch.  3, 4.25, 4, 4, 4.   2015.   Black as black can be. Diminutive head forms and fades away real quick. Appearance ends up looking like Coca Cola. Eh.  The aroma is intoxicating, and I mean that literally. Smells like a straight shot of Jack Daniels. Trailing behind are syrupy sap straight from the tree, melted sticky plum, and french pressed coffee aromas.   Wow. If this isn't complex, I don't know what is. Quite possibly the most complex beer I've ever laid lips to, and out of 800 some odd trials, that's quite a feat. Oddly enough it's still easily drinkable, and by that I mean sippable. Bourbon County manages to do away with lingering bitterness or off-flavors. A total array of chocolate, cream, milk, caramels, sugared plum, coffee, dried figs - all swirling at once taking turns like the Knights of the Round Summon in Final Fantasy VII. This is a beer that if you simply take a shot glass sized sample, you get the full gammut and you know right off the bat what this beer has to offer. If you don't like this you either hate stouts or you've got a bad batch (known to happen). The fading flavors are perfectly done morning coffee, a touch of acidity, and bourbon-soaked plums.   The feel is nothing short of substantial. It just destroys the palate with syrup and a stickiness rivaling caramel apples. This is a palate wrecker in the sense that it doesn't scrub your tongue, it invades it.   Overall Bourbon County seemed to be not worth the hype until I laid lips to it. I paid $13.99 for this bottle and I feel it was a bit stiff, but on the flipside you could spend that on a 12 pack of Budweiser and not get 1/4 of the experience presented here. I'll be having this again next year.    (P.S. : 1/3 of the bottle is gone, and so am I)  3.5, 3.75, 5, 4.5, Overall : 4.5 (4.46)","  rDev DATE: November 3, 2020... OCCASION: four years of the last presidency led to a beer I have cellared for almost as long... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours a jet-black body with a quarter-inch ochre-tinted swirl that roils stoically... first waft: bold bourbon, heavy brown sugar, vanilla, leather, raisin, toasted malts, caramel and toffee, with hints of woodiness and chocolate.... a thick, viscous burn finishes a fiery, grand gesture--the teeth acknowledge the hop profile, while the body coats the mouth like the best medicine... full-bodied, weighty, each sip a ponderance of the more than three years it has sat waiting for this night--a bit creamy and dry its pull... vanilla, boozy, toasted malts, caramel--almost an ice cream finish that satisfies like a dessert... the chocolate and brown sugar builds a powerful impact, lingering and uplifting... this is indeed an epic beer, with wine-like hubris and scotch-like respect... Goose Island may catch flack for their In-Bev association, but this is a legit beer for a special occasion like this...","  rDev 2019 vintage, best by 6/29/24  Here we are. A beer that sits amongst the best of the best, currently at number 24 on this site. I've actually sampled this before. It was my friends birthday and I wanted to get him something nice, so I grabbed him a bottle of this, but that left me without enough money to get a bottle for myself. Needless to say, my generous friend poured me a bit and I loved it, though I did not review it  This beer pours a velvety black with just a finger of brown head that quickly fades to a ring, leaving legs behind instead of lacing  The aroma really is something to marvel at. Intensely complex and constantly toeing the line between sweet and roasty. For starters, I get sweet bourbon, vanilla, chewy caramel, and oak. Some less obvious notes include medium roast coffee, raisin, maple syrup, dark breads, and a surprisingly small trace of alcohol  I don't think this beer ever really settles down on one set of flavors, rather it redefines itself throughout the entire bottle. Starting off with smoky malt, sweet bourbon and a touch of alcohol heat, this lets you know its' strength. However, this mellows out nicely on the swallow. After that, notes of caramel, raisin, cinnamon, dark chocolate, and coffee are wrapped up in a smooth, buttery oak. Again, every sip here seems to be unique, and I picked up on additional flavors of walnut, banana, plum, and nutmeg  Obviously this is a full bodied beer, borderline decadent dessert. When you pair this with an almost complete lack of carbonation (other than the tingle from the alcohol) you end up with a beer meant to be savored. Rich and chewy in the finish, coating the mouth completely after every sip  Absolutely indulgent stout right here. It's crazy that one of the highest rated beers in the world is so readily available (and reasonably priced at $10/0.5 L). I intend to pick up more bottles when I see it around and need something solid to fall back on. I plan on keeping this review going with every new vintage I have. Cheers!!  ————————————————————  EDIT 11/28/21: 2021 vintage best by 8/4/26  I’m happy to have found a fresh base BCBS this year, having only had one with a year of age on it before. Let’s see how that changes it  The pour is similar this time, but leaves much better lacing, bumping from 4.25 to 4.5 in my head  Honestly the nose here is almost exactly the same as what I described above. I would have to have them side by side to say for certain, but I think the bourbon is a little more prevalent in this one  Holy hell, this is way hotter in taste when it’s fresh. A bit less of the smoke I got in the last bottle, but everything else here is similar just stronger. I think I definitely prefer it with a bit of age on it  The body is pretty much the same, but the heat does detract a bit  Yeah, I think 1 year is the best time to drink this (of what I’ve had so far). I don’t think it’s really batch variability as I’ve heard they’re pretty consistent across the years. I know this year had a 14% version and a 14.4% version, this one being the 14% version. Also this beer moved down a spot on the top rankings here, from #24 to #25","  rDev From the 22 oz bottle in a snifter. A tried and true one for certain. This award winner pours a rich obsidian with a nice head of brown  foam that settles to a thick ring, thin light film, and displays some  very nice lacing. Nose of Brown sugar dashed bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark cocoa, dark coffee, and moderate char and brulee. Flavors follow the nose with a nice dark cocoa and coffee flavor layered over char and roast with deep brown sugar, oak, and warming bourbon with  touches of vanilla. Excellent mouth feel; full body, smooth, rich, coating, light carbonation that is just enough to give this beast some rise, and a  rich full faintly dry finish.  What can one say---there is a reason it is an award winner, that said it ranks amongst the greats from Clown Shoes and others (Hoofhearted  comes to mind) who have taken the idea and made a go of it themselves.  That said it is still and always will be a winner as well as a great choice  for a rich and full stout experience.  Cheers","  rDev 2019 16.9oz bottle drink by 30 SEP 24 poured into a Duvel glass at just above fridge temp 15.2% ABV. The beer pours dense black with mocha brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and eventually a thin ring. Minimal lacing. The aroma is complex with caramel, dried fruit, chocolate fudge and dark chocolate. The taste is decadent chocolate fudge with additional notes of toffee, dried fruit, coffee and vanilla before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is very full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. There's a little boozieness, but it's well integrated and fits the style. The taste reveals more molasses and dark fruit as it warms. Overall, outstanding. One of the best I've sampled, but the price is out of line with the competition.","  rDev Look: It pours very dark brown with a brown head. Head retention is good.   Smell: The initial aromas are bourbon, chocolate and roast. There are low vanilla notes with some dark fruits.   Taste: It has dark chocolate flavor with roast and bourbon. There are some burnt elements with vanilla and dark fruits.   Feel: It has a full body with very strong alcohol warming. It is warming, not hot. The flavor last long into the finish.   Overall, a complex blend of multiple elements with powerful alcohol without being hot.","  rDev I think this one is 14.9. My brother is starting to prune his cellar a bit so we shared a bottle with my sister in from California for the holidays. This is exquisite in texture and smoother than I thought possible, even six years aged. This has heavy whisky tones and notes of molasses and caramel. Kind of a delicious melange.","  rDev 1pt.9oz bottle into a goblet. 2019 release.  Looks outstanding in the glass. Black as night oily body. Small light tan head dissipates to a ring, leaving a only a trace of lacing.  Nice aroma. Dried and dark skin fruit, molasses and bourbon.  Upon tasting, it's smooth, sweet, toffee, and molasses. A touch of vanilla, and the bourbon haunts throughout. Warms the throat, and there is not a trace of harshness, speaking to the quality of the brewing and aging process.  Mouth full, finish sweet and warm, rolls around the tongue beautifully.  Although I am reluctant to put a penny into AB's purse, finally pulled the trigger, and I'm glad I did. This is a world class beer.","  rDev Poured into a tulip.  Pours opaque brownish-black with very limited head but a nice ring of lacing.  The aromas come from every quarter of the map. Dark fruits (raisins, dried cherries, figs); nuts (cashews and almonds); chocolate; bourbon; coffee; vanilla; char; anise; leather; and smoke; with maple syrup, molasses, sorghum, honey, brown sugar, and candi sugar. As the brew warms, the aromas become more and more prevalent and complex. This is one of the most complex and welcome aromas of any brew I've had.  The brew arrives on the tip of the tongue with caramel malt, cashew, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, coffee, carob, chocolate, char, anise, tobacco, and some warming but not burning booze at the finish.  The brew is full-bodied but not heavy or sticky. Just enough carbonation and drying/warming booze.  After many years of waiting for this legend to arrive to the barren prairie, this is a welcome brew.","  rDev Look - basically thick black liquid tar with a brown rim foam and sticky lacing Smell - really dark fruit, toasty, boozy, rich caramel and chocolate Taste - strong but not less than I expected with a 14.7 abv. A lot of those same accents as the scent and some woodiness as well Feel - full body light carbonation with a slight crisp Overall - fantastic beer  2014 had in November 2021 Look - nice black and thick for 7 years 4.25.

Ok, this probably is the best tasting stout I have had. The flavors are bright and intense.   Poured from a bottle sitting in the fridge for a while. Decanted into a tulip glass. Fairly black color with short lived brown head and little lacing. Pungent smell of dark chocolate and bourbon. Intense flavors of both along with vanilla and very dark, very ripe fruit. I need to see if I can find a 2019 bottle!","  rDev Appearance: Deep, dark amber body, with a modest, very dense tan head, with superb persistence. Thick, absolutely unbroken, fine-beaded lacing adorns the glass walls.  Aroma: Very strong notes of bourbon, wood, and alcohol dominates the aroma. The nose is profoundly spicy, with vanilla, dark molasses, brown sugar, and oak wood being extraordinarily prominent., but, most especially sweet, vinous alcohol, and vanilla beans.  Taste: Opens with strong notes of oak wood and sweet alcohol, soon followed by brown sugar and molasses. Coffee notes are present, in modest amounts. The oak-like wood provides a gracious backdrop, which lingers throughout the taste, as do the sweet undercurrents of alcohol. As the taste draws to a close, the strong notes of molasses and alcohol intensify, bringing the taste to a memorable close.  Mouth feel: Smooth, extraordinarily full, and absolutely gracious, no less than stellar in its presentation.  Drinkabilty/notes: A beer that would stagger the drinker by its utter greatness,, all the while being attainable for most, due to widespread availability and a reasonable price.  Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen point nine ounce custom glass bomber, with a pry-off crown, served in a South-American-style Pilsener glass.","  rDev 2013 vintage consumed 13-Dec-2013. Very tasty and rich on a very cold night. Sweet, malty, chocolatey, with notes of dried fruit. Warming. Mmm good.","  rDev Pours black with nary a head, fine carbonation visible. Nose of malty bourbon. Flavor follows suit, very sweet followed by a wave of bourbon goodness. Hops are not really noticeable. Definitely a sipping beer and it gets better as it warms up. Drinking the 2018 version, booze is definitely noticeable but surprisingly not that hot. A good stout albeit rather expensive.  Personally, I prefer Founder's Backwoods Bastard over this,this is just too sweet for my taste.","  rDev One of the best of the planet's dark beverages! Thick (used to be thicker). Incredible. My favorite was 2014, followed by 2015, then 2017. Seems they have off years and some inconsistency. Also the occasional quality control problem that they have done better than most to make up for.  Molasses, bourbon, smoke, leather - all the good stuff concentrated.","  rDev 16.9oz bottle. Bottling date is '24OCT16'. 13.8% ABV. Black colored body, with no back lit highlights. Brief tan head, leaves behind a bubble fed ring and a swirling bubble fed surface. No lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malts, with oak bourbon barrels and some dark fruit, along with slight vanilla, caramel, and smoke. Taste of dark roasted malts and dark cherry and raisin, along with bourbon oak barrel and its vanilla, also caramel and dark char. Burbs of dark chocolate. Medium plus mouth feel, heavy texture with the alcohol. Lesser carbonation feel. This is a high ABV% stout with appropriate flavors. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 16.9oz bottle. Bottling date is '15SEP17'. 14.1% ABV. Black colored body, with no back lit highlights. Brief fizzy (noisy) tan head disappears, leaving no head and no ring. No lacing. Aroma of bourbon oak barrel, dark roasted malts, caramel, and thin vanilla. Taste of dark roasted malts soaked in bourbon oak barrels, with caramel, vanilla, and slight smoke.  Medium plus mouth feel, very smooth texture. Seems like absent carbonation. Correctly tasting imperial stout that conducts itself as a smooth drinking experience. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 16.9oz bottle. Bottling date is '07SEP18'. 15.2% ABV. Black colored body. Brief tan colored head settles back to some swirling small islands and an active thin ring. Leaves behind a few tiny spots of lacing, but most slide back down into body. Aroma of oak bourbon barrel, with rich caramel and vanilla. Dark roasted malts. Taste of purple grapes soaked in the bourbon oak barrel. Big vanilla and caramel components, with a supporting smokiness. Rich dark roasted malts.  Mouth feel is heavy and thick, with a coating of the mouth texture. Better carbonation. This is a real treat of high ABV%, toffee/caramel, oak barrel with vanilla, and a base of dark roasted malts. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In trying the vintages of 2016, 2017, and 2018, the 2018 is most rewarding in smell density, taste profile, and mouth feel. The 2016 vintage presented as thinner and with dark fruit expressions. The 2017 vintage lacked the warmness and smoothness of the 2018 vintage. Based on my limited review, I say that aging BCBS is not necessary and will likely lessen the drinking pleasure experience. Rating is based on the 2018 vintage.","  Pours a black color with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. Aromas of roasted, chocolate, caramel, bourbon, and vanilla. Tastes of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. Great mouth feel.","  rDev Review #600  Delicious imperial stout that really lives up to its hype - although I gave it almost straight 4.5s all the way through, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't going to reach the 4.6-4.7 range beer that I was expecting, especially given that this was a 2016 vintage that I'd specifically aged a few more months just to wait as long as I could. Looks great, nice deep dark rich black color with a little tan lingering head and just a hint of some spotty lingering lacing. Would have given it more points if it had nicer-looking lacing, but I gave an extra 0.25 for the richness of the color and of the tan head. Smells great, lots of dark mocha fudge, vanilla, medium roast coffee, roasted nuttiness, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, fig, oak, bourbon and some toffee. Aromas blended well together and the smell was just heavenly. Taste follows the nose, and again that rich chewy fudge, vanilla, oak and bourbon is just so well-balanced. There was a little alcohol upfront as the beer warmed, but not aggressively so, and the very high ABV always felt deceivingly well-hidden. Smooth, rich, chewy, thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just enough carbonation to match the depth of this stout. I really enjoyed it, wish I had more bottles to sample and savor at a later date, and couldn't recommend this beer more highly. It paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert. Delicious!","  rDev 22 oz bottle, 2018. Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of chocolate malt, toast, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla and spices. Body is full, creamy and smooth. Taste is of bourbon, nutty, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit, vanilla and spices. Finish is long, massive and spicy. Delicious brew.","  rDev My first taste of this legend. 2018 version. poured at cellar temp  Pours a really beautiful rich ebony brown. Very active cocoa colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. Lots of visible carbonation. Smell is boozy and figgy. chocolate. dark fruit. some light roastiness. coherent and pleasant. Taste is rich and smooth up front with just a touch of boozy heat on the back end. Bitter chocolate is much more prominent than in the nose, dark fruit much less present. Chocolate is in fact quite dominant. There seems to be a bit of detectable barrel (although it's faint enough for me that I can imagine it is psychosomatic) and with a bit of wine-snob aeration in the mouth the bourbon is easily detectable.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Truly lovely body that is certainly dominant on the palate but doesn't seem to build up too much. Overall I am genuinely impressed. This is one that you hear so much about that it is hard to go into it without preconceptions. To me though, this is an excellent stout, and at $12 for a pint+ bottle it's actually kind of a good deal. Rich and chocolatey (without chocolate added), complex and yet coherent. This is certainly a deserving superstar. Well done GI","  rDev Wanted to love this beer after waiting so many years for the chance to try it. Unfortunately, I can only say  like  as it seems to be true that you can have too much of a good thing. The over-the-top ABV and flavors just don't meld for a great overall experience. And that's from a guy who loves other  big  bourbon beers like KBS, Parabola, BA TenFidy, BA Expedition, etc. Individual notes of bourbon, leather, tobacco, licorice, chocolate, charred grains, etc are all there, but the ABV is just a couple points too high to allow all that goodness to come together. Instead of doing everything possible to push this beer to 11, I wish they had just the slightest restraint and allowed all the goodness to come out in full. Still a pretty good beer, but definitely not at the hype level. A bit tough to finish the whole thing over the course of a long sitting.","  rDev Since it didn't require any chasing around this year with plenty on the shelf, I decided to buy a couple; one to drink, one for the cellar. Aroma is whiskey with roasted malts, caramel, vanilla, dark fruits. Deep black with just a slight brown tinge around the edges with a back light. Short tan head dies quickly to a ring with an island in the middle. No lacing. Thick, chewy, substantial body initially on the tongue. Deep flavor of whiskey, roasty raisins, caramel, vanilla, and alcohol. Sweet and delicious. The finish is mild (low bitterness) with an alcohol burn. This stout is dangerously easy drinking and smooth. I had to keep reminding myself of the ABV... slowly, sip slowly!","  rDev 2018 vintage. Bottled on 9/17/18. 16.9oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours almost black with some brown hues; dark khaki head that fades nice retention and lacing. The aromas are balanced, but pretty bold. The bourbon comes through along with some chocolate. Hints of caramel along with some mild hints of vanilla. It has a chocolate chip cookie vibe going on. Some char and peat most in the mix. Some oak. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose, but are even bolder. Once again everything is balanced, but bold. It's on the sweeter side, but it's not cloying or over the top at all. The bourbon shines without dominating. More chocolate, caramel along with some hints of vanilla. More hints of oak/wood in the mix. There's a subtle spiciness in the finish. Low bitterness. Very nice malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is definitely hidden, which is very impressive. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. It's fluffy, creamy, velvety and very smooth. This beer is the epitome of being dangerously drinkable.  This is an awesome stout. It's worthy of the hype. In a way it's simple, straight forward and not flashy. It's just just simply executed at the highest level. It's scary how smooth it is. Balance is honestly the key with this one. The craftsmanship is top notch. This is definitely an elite barrel-aged stout. Great stuff.","  rDev L - Dark as night, but nothing all that distinctive as stouts go - appearance is black than black, so...it's on to S - Hey there good smellin' - marshmallows on fire, with bourbon to boot, some choco-caffeine noticeable even though this is not the coffee version.

Tons of chocolate and vanilla, a bit lighter on the bourbon M:Full-bodied, incredibly smooth O: A very impressive, very well-made stout","  rDev I have heard about this beer, read about it, seen it in social media, and finally got a chance to try it...  ...on a special day no less. So I figured a special day calls for something special. From the pour, to what met my nose, to what crossed my tongue, there's only one thing I can say...Wow...as in *wow*. Hot damn, this is good. This is one of those rare beers I have had that you simply take the time to enjoy, sip, slosh, experience, repeat...slowly...and I did. The look is perfectly black, even though there is no foam or lacing. The smell is an almost perfect blend of the bourbon and distinct stout scent, even with a hint of chocolate and coffee. The same can be said for the taste - and with a hint of heat from the booze, which adds an extra dimension to the overall experience. I can get the hype, I can ignore the hate, and I will be looking forward to the next one I can age and sit back and enjoy...","  rDev Bourbon county 2017. Finally, my chance to see what the hype is all about. Pours a jetblack. Viscous, with coffee and vanilla notes. Incredibly smooth.

Rich and malty, roasty as all get out with a great dose of bitter from a nice malt-hop combo punch. Late licorice Full body, smooth mouthfeel with a good moderate but scrubbing carbonation. Lengthy bitter and roasty dry finish. World-Class.","  rDev From the older bottle, it pours a very dark brown color with a light brown head that reduces to a quarter inch and sticks around. Lacing. The scent is burnt/roasted malts with a touch of chocolate and spices. The taste is roasted malts, chocolate and dark fruit. Aftertaste is amazingly pleasant.","  rDev Solid black appearance. Medium light carbonation with a just above average body. Slightly creamy feel which all adds up to a nice body. Aroma is malt, roasted malt, dark cocoa, sweet anise candy. Mild char, smoke, and black coffee. The taste is very mildly sweet with some bitter char,smoke,dark bakers chocolate. Leaves an almost dry chalky dark cocoa aftertaste.

Beer is black as expected.  On the nose, strong aromas of dark chocolates and roasted malts.  Starting sipping on it now the flavors of the aforementioned dark chocolate are there, along with oats and an expresso bitter finish.   This is a very thick bodied RIS with moderate carbonation.   Overall, this is no doubt a World class beer that need a slow sipping, enjoying it more as you drink it. Unlike some other stouts like CBS or the New Holland Milk Stout this is not so sweet. The bitter aspect is predominant and overwhelming. It’s totally worth your bucks, euros or pounds.","  rDev Agree with several others in that all I taste is burnt malt. I am no expert, but Founders Imperial Stout and Dark Horse Plead the Fifth are far superior RIS. I can’t dis the price, well under $2 per 12 oz bottle.","  rDev Looks great poured, the color and head expected in a stout. The taste has a burnt malt rather than roasted malt flavor. Alcohol can be detected and with a 9% ABV, no loss of points there. There are other Imperial Stouts that manage to deliver the same octane, but with a much smoother feel. I'll have another but I won't seek it out.  Second review from a tap pour: It still looks great. Some of the burnt malt aspect has mitigated, but not enough to change the rating. It drinks even more lightly across the palate. There's not a significant reason to change any of the numbers. This one is over-rated by many.","  rDev Oh, Old Ras, we finally meet. I've heard a lot about this one  Pours a deep dark brown with 2 fingers of mocha colored head, slowly fades and leaves tons of lacing  Huge aromas of bitter roast, licorice, mild vanilla and coffee  Mmmmm, taste is really similar but some hops get to shine through too. Some dark sweet fruits in the beginning before the roast and hops come in to create a nice bittersweet finish  Definitely full bodied and dancing the line between roasty and creamy, this drinks super easy for the abv with mild carbonation  Overall I really enjoyed this one. Went well with a fruit and nut dark chocolate bar to bring out some of those notes, will pick it up again","  rDev No bottling date present  Pours deep pitch black body with copper brown highlights and topped with two fingers of tight, almost creamy light mocha head, head retention is nearly beyond reproach, fading ever so steadily to a paper-thin cap strewn with clumpy islands, a moderate creamy cap, and a stringy spatter of bubbly lacing.  Aroma features big notes of heavily roasted malt soaked in jammy plums upfront, followed by astringent, smoky coffee grounds, a dark fruit medley, and a touch of alcohol; smooth milk chocolate takes a firm hold of the background as the beer warms.  Taste profile interchanges between plummy sweetness, malty char, and dark chocolate, with an toasted pumpernickel bread and astringent, spent coffee grounds back end/exhale.  Mouthfeel features a body just a touching the heavier side of medium, with moderate carbonation and persistent mild astringency coursing across the palate; dry and roasty throughout, but especially present leading to a finish teeming with boozy depth.  So blunt and embracing of its intensities it becomes an unabashed hallmark and an authentic highlighting of what defines the Russian imperial stout against its American counterpart; a standard-bearer and perpetually enjoyable take on the style for an unflinching malt profile and deceptively approachable body; as one who greatly prefers American imperial stouts, I have great respect for this beer.","  rDev L: Jet black color, two finger brown head, nice lacing, no visible carbonation.  S: Chocolate, roasted coffee.  T: Chocolate, roasted coffee.  F: Full bodied, thick as motor oil. Full flavored.  O: Nice Russian imperial stout.","  rDev Creamy beige mousse like head with some rocks sits atop black liquid poured at 58 degrees; long cap retention; thick ring; moderately heavy lacing; thin legs. Burnt roast malt nose. Bitter roast malt, char taste; dark chocolate. Medium full body, moderate carbonation.

S: Aromas of black cafe, unseated chocolate, walnut, and licorice. A white pepper note. T: Semisweet. Flavors follow the nose. Bitterness solid and consistent with the style. M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Almost chewy. O: A really delicious Russian Imperial Stout. Oddly but aptly named somehow. Strong and a bit crazy.","  rDev Old Rasputin brewed by North Coast Brewing Co. ,with an ABV of 9.00% This Russian Imperial Stout pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer an deep brown color with an a nice light brown head. This brew has the look of black coffee, not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted goodness. You pick up on a lot of roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of hop bitterness at the end to tie it all together. So far Old Rasputin is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold an Rich with flavors. You first pick on all the roasted goodness. Lots of nice smooth roasted malts and grains. The body of Old Rasputin is a medium to heavy. Not to heavy but definitely a lot heavier than other Stouts on the market. It is hard to pick up on the 9.00% ABV in this brew, it goes down just that smooth. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The mouth feel is Rich, Bold, Roasted, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Old Rasputin a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. North Coast Brewing Co., did a super nice job with this Russian Imperial Stout.","  rDev Having a classic, and it deserves the title.  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.

Same with the nose. Black, opaque, tan refined nitro head. Medium/full body. Better than I remembered. 70 IBUs","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Possible date stamp on label is '81330709'. This is a 2018 produced beer. Black colored body, with some dark brown and ruby brown edges when back lit. Aggressive pour brought forth a one finger, puffy, khaki colored head. Each sip leaves behind a few scattered spots of lacing. Well balanced aroma of dark roasted malts with char, coffee, and chocolate. Out of the char is a whiff of dark dried fruits. Taste is dark roasted malts that express deep dark chocolate, burnt coffee, and a hint of soaked, dark dried fruit. Quite the smooth and creamy mouth feel. Very enjoyable. Okay carbonation. Not overly bitter. Tremendous balance of the flavors lead to a very pleasant drinking experience. Very easy to take repeated sips in short order. Bitterness is kept very low and the char stays at the end, but the slight sweetness of the malts balance this out. There is a companion component of brighter hops that add well to the mix and balance.","  rDev Unknown vintage; drank 7/29/18 @ the Yarchives.   Black/brown appearance.   A violent pour yielded a HUGE dark tan head; thick tree-rung lace.   Fresh earth, medium roast coffee bean &amp; hop bite notes in the nose.   Creamy medium thick mouthfeel.   Medium roast coffee bean &amp; hop bite flavors up front; fresh earth notes on the finish.   Too hop forward for me to really love; this is practically a Cascadian dark ale.","  rDev Very excited to try this beer after hearing a lot about its reputation. Nice dark black color with some lingering foamy head and lacing. Smells faintly of coffee and chocolate, tastes of dark chocolate, dark coffee, some malt and hoppiness without much bitterness. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, trace lingering hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. A nice enjoyable stout.","  rDev Oily black in color. Poured with a tall, creamy, espresso beige foam with medium light retention. Intense, earthy, dark roasted malt, sweet dark malts, dark fruit and dark chocolate aromas with an underlying booziness. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Smooth, slightly oily, creamy feel through the middle followed by pleasant boozy warmth to the finish. Sweet dark malt flavors up front that slowly transition to intense roasted maltiness. Medium bitterness through the middle followed by bitter , charred malt overtop emerging boozy warmth. Finished semi-dryly with grainy, dark malt flavors followed by dark roasted maltiness that transition to mellow, burnt malt notes.

Smells of roasted coffee, caramel and a hint of dark fruits. Taste follows the nose with a rich roasted coffee taste and notes of sweet caramel malts, dark fruits and chocolate, with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice, but could honestly be better, which is my main complain here. Does not top Narwhal for me, which has a better mouthfeel and is more chocolate-forward, with a milder bitterness.","  rDev 12oz bottled 5/8/17 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 9% ABV. The beer pours dense black with mocha brown head. The head recedes to a ring and patchy islands leaving lacing from the top of the glass to the bottom. The aroma is roast malt, coffee and a hint of dark fruit. The taste is semisweet dark fruit at first that transitions to big roasty bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated, smooth and dry. Overall, excellent. This is a standard bearer for the style.","  rDev From notes 2/3/12: Pours midnight black but when inspected closely is found to be very dark brown with a ruby hint when held to the light. The pour produces a huge, lasting, tight, cottony, mocha head which leaves thin, sticky lacing. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, dark bread, roast and earthy hops. Taste is semi-sweet dark chocolate, toffee, roasted/burnt malt, dates, figs and fruit cake with coffee in the finish where it blends with hop bitterness and peppery spice. Heavy bodied, complex and incredibly good!","  rDev Poured from fridge temp. Pours jet black with light tan head. Nose is smoke, tobacco, roasted malts, and licorice. Very strong and nice. Taste is a smack in the face. Crazy coffee, bitterness, smoke, molasses, tobacco, and chocolate. Bitterness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Amazing.","  rDev Bomber purchased at the LCBO; bottled Oct 28 2016 and served slightly chilled. Not the first time I've enjoyed this stout, though it is the first time I've had a chance to review it.  Pours black as night, with roughly one inch of frothy, tan-coloured foam seated atop. Ungodly retention; the head gives up virtually no ground for more than 15 minutes, though it does take on a smoother, creamier, lumpier appearance - as its big, soapy bubbles burst, gradually being replaced from below by tiny, finer gauge bubbles. Beautiful lacing, too; this is a visually-stunning brew. The aroma reveals this to be a rather well-hopped stout, with big leafy, earthy hop notes coming through almost as clearly as the rich, roasted malts themselves. Black coffee, molasses, dark chocolate and cocoa figure in strongly, with accents of licorice, dates, raisin, alcohol and smoke supplying added depth of character to the nose.  A genuine treat to sip. Big roasted malt flavours dominate the profile right off the bat - espresso coffee and baker's chocolate blend together with a mix of caramelized sugar and molasses sweetness. Hints of date, prune and vanilla also come through by the midpoint, with the sip rounded out by herbal licorice, earthy pine resin and leafy hop bitterness on the back end. Finishes bitter, with coffee grounds and earthy hop flavours fading as you approach the dry-ish aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with restrained carbonation that gently prickles the palate and provides a slight bite; the overall texture is quite smooth, luscious and creamy. Pleasurable and fulfilling to sip.  Final Grade: 4.35, an A grade. Old Rasputin is exactly what an imperial Russian stout should be - rich, smooth, balanced, and intense. When I first tried this imperial stout a few years back, I definitely liked it, but not to the extent where I considered it one of the best - however, this follow-up sampling has converted me into a true believer. The exquisite balance achieved between the roasted malts and sturdy hop notes is nothing less than a thing of beauty. There may very well be better stouts out there, but that doesn't diminish what North Coast has managed to accomplish. One of the grand-daddies of them all; if you haven't tried Old Rasputin, do yourself a favour and take whatever steps are necessary to correct that.","  rDev I am baffled as to how it has taken me until now to review this beer. I wish that it were as easy as blaming it on The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody, but this was a fairly fresh bottle that I recently scored simply to drink &amp; review. I am scratching my head in response.   From the bottle:  Brewed in the tradition of the 18th century English brewers who supplied the Russian court of Catherine the Great. ;  Old Rasputin develops a cult following wherever it goes. It's a rich, intense brew with big, complex flavors &amp; a warming finish.   Still shaking my head, I Pop!ped the cap &amp; began a slow, gentle pour. Once sufficiently decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised three-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with good retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing deep brown highlights to be visible only at the edges. Nose was smoky, with notes of coffee and especially dark chocolate brownies. To be even more precise, this smelled like liquefied chocolate brownies! Wow. No wonder this is so popular. I was impressed &amp; I hadn't even taken my first sip of this review! Mouthfeel was big, thick &amp; creamy, a dollop on my tongue. I just let it lie there &amp; roll around. The dark, rich chocolaty taste was like a liquefied dessert, whether brownies, chocolate mousse, chocolate ice cream, ad chocofinitum. Wow! Finish was semi-sweet since the chocolate also had a bitter edge to it. It was just a bit much for me and left me craving something that was hop-driven. An RIS just is not my bag.","  rDev This one has a couple years on it. L- Pours a very dark brown impenetrable to light. A one-finger, creamy, tan head with next to no carbonation. S- Roasted coffee, caramel malt, cocoa. T- Bitter coffee dominates with black licorice transitioning into bitter hop. Dark chocolate. Bitterness resinates up the nose. F- One of the best warming feeling I have had. Very slight alcohol burn. O- Awesome Russian stout. Just as they should be.","  rDev Pours total black with a shortlived espresso head. Dark chocolate and coffee with maple syrup in the nose. The taste is roasty, with rich chocolate notes. Pinesol and lemony hops provide great balance. Tobacco and leather notes in the background. The mouthfeel is medium full with a light carbonation. Moderate bitterness and dark chocolate and roasted barley in the long finish.  A very nice RIS, very much to style with plenty of complexity and balance. Any dark beer fan should seek it out.","  rDev It pours a pretty solid black color with a giant three-plus fingers of lasting tan foam that leave heavy webbed lacing.  Nutty, lightly-roasted malts, chocolate and a little coffee stand out in the aroma. These continue to the taste where they mix with a stronger, more charred-malt flavor, some pretty strong hop bitterness, a slight vegetal flavor and a kiss of alcohol on the backend.   It's medium-to-heavy bodied with strong carbonation in play in the mouthfeel.   To me, this is a beer that would have seemed world class fifteen years ago. The vegetal note and the not-quite-perfect carbonation level knock it a bit in my scoring, but I really appreciate the charred, bitter qualities in this one and can definitely see why it's beloved.

Fizzes well in the mouth. Classic style and taste. Clearly hop driven but low in bitterness. Very drinkable. When I first drank this years ago, the excessive bitterness in IPAs was going on, and my impression was that this beer was lacking. With more experience I now recognize this as just a well made IPA, one to come back to again and again.","  rDev Umm, sure. Why not? This one is a classic, and I believe that I’ll treat it like such. Yeah, it’s pretty much AOL on a dial up; it will do the trick at the time, but there was a more beautiful and bright future to be had. A lil caramel, a lil malt... Yeah, that’s basically it. So ima peace out.  Bye!","  rDev Poured from a can -clear medium gold with thick white head leaving significant frosty lacing. Nose is slightly hoppy with some sweet malt notes. Taste follows with a bit more malt and a slight hop bite then an almost dry finish. More along the lines of a classic WC ipa than the NE stuff out now.","  rDev Nice amber pour with significant but quickly dissipating off-white head, some of which is left on the inside of the glass. A pleasant hoppy bouquet carries nicely into the taste. The hop delivery is on the dry side, not overly bitter, with an enjoyable linger. It drinks a little thin on the pallet, despite its nice dose of hops.","  rDev 12oz can from the variety pack  Agressive pour gives a big ole head that sticks around, cloudy but clear of 'chunks'. Smells like freshly cut grass. Tastes 'green'. Leafy, greasy and sweet. Ton of malt that almosts outshadows the hops.   This tastes great, dwarfed by modern IPAs but still high quality","  rDev Bottled 3/20/20  Just realized I’ve never actually reviewed this American classic, as I usually just have it at bars  Pours a clear copper orange with 2 slowly settling fingers of soapy white head, just a bit of lacing  Aromas of zesty citrus, wheat, piney hops and caramel malts. Nothing too overbearing, great aroma  The lemony citrus and pine come through strong in the beginning of the sip, getting a bit more oily as the sip progresses, before finishing with lightly bitter hops  Medium bodied with very mild carbonation, this is rather still, but refreshing nonetheless with a mostly dry finish  It’s funny to me, seeing a beer I generally take for granted get rated so high by me. It’s always a solid option and widely available in bars and restaurants so I never really think twice about getting it, but keeping some of this at home would probably be a good idea for me. A classic for a reason","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip.  Pours crystal-clear orange-gold. Good head, but quickly gone. Thin but persistent lacing.  Classic but restrained hop aromas. Pine, citrus, hints of dank. Very subdued, however.  The brew has solid IPA flavors as well, with a bit more assertiveness. A touch of pale and caramel malt sweetness quickly steps aside for equal parts citrus and resin goodness A clean finish.  The brew feels down-the-middle medium in weight and finish.  I can't help but wonder if this one was getting a little  long in the tooth  (bottled in late December, and it's nearly mid-February, so getting close to 45 days). The hop flavors didn't pop like others have described. Then again, I've had the 75 and 90-minute varieties with consistently good results. Still, an excellent brew.","  rDev Drinking this at Tapped a local tap house. Appears Amber, hazy orangish, nice white head that dropped quickly. Smells citrusy, piney, orange, grapefruit.

Pours orangish yellow, with a one-finger white head. Nose is vanilla, light citrus, and berry. Taste is grapefruit, some melon, some pine, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. Excellent mouthfeel, overall excellent.","  rDev I'm surprised I've never reviewed this classic. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy, golden-orange with a half finger of fluffy, bright white cap and a thin film of lacing. It has a classic IPA nose of tart, bitter citrus and pine needles. But as the glass warms there is increasing sweet malt, onion, hop oil, and tangerine. The taste opens with bitter citrus: lemon peel and grapefruit rind, with some sweet citrus in the background. The hops are bitter but without a strong bite. The mouth feel is great! Lite and crisp with lively carbonation, and with an ABV of only 6% it's crushable. I typically enjoy the Dogfish 90 better but the 60 is and always will be a great beach-drinking IPA.","  rDev Amber tinted clear gold color with good cap and lacing.  Aroma of bready malt and citrus hops with touches of pine and grapefruit.  Flavor for me is about 60'40 hop/malt ratio with both malt and hops retaining their identity. Malt is rich with the slightest touch of sweetness with hops shining brightly yet the hop flavors of pine, herbs, citrus and fruit all sing with one harmonious note. Also without bitterness which is a neat trick considering the amount of hops used. Very complex, very polished and easy to drink.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.  Overall a delightful brew that outclasses it's bigger brother, the 90 minute.","  rDev De Beershelf. En copa Teku. Jugando a Slay the Spire y Guacamelee 2.

From a 12 ounce bottle dated 07/25/18 and it still tastes great! Verified by a fresher bottle. 06/03/2020 only 35 days old. Excellent beer.

Surprised I'd never reviewed it so, after Dry January and now craving some hops -- here goes.  Poured into my Libbey Imperial Pint. Bottled-on date of 12/11/18 -- so not terribly old.  L -- Clear, deep gold with a white head that pours very dense and holds up well, leaving nice lacing as it slowly settles.  S -- Pine resins up front. Vague biscuit malts fighting to be recognized.  T -- Same pine resins up front in the flavor, if not as harsh as in the nose. Lightly sweet biscuit malts balancing out the hops nicely. Bitter resins rounding out the finish and aftertaste. Light citrus notes at the very finish of the drink.  F -- Mouthfeel is soft to crisp with a light-medium body.  O -- While I wish there was more malt character in the nose, and maybe more citrus esters in the flavor, that's just my preferences in an IPA. There's no mistaking what's in your glass with this beer, and it's very well made.","  rDev From notes 8/23/14: Pours a clear pale gold producing 3+ fingers of off-white, finely bubbled, foamy, lasting head that leaves motes and blotches of lacing. Aroma is sweet with hop notes of pine and citrus backed by caramel malt and something floral and candy sugar like. It is heavenly hoppy from mid-sip into the aftertaste. Taste is more balanced than its 90 minute sibling. Starts sweet and finishes bitter-sweet with a dry, peppery finish. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate-high carbonation; peppery bite, lightly chewy, finishing dry with an astringency lasting deep into the aftertaste.","  rDev Brilliant and clear golden body topped with a thick, sculpted head. A crisp and mildly sweet malty aroma, suggestive of crystal malt; some ester floating in the background.

A solid IPA bringing a pleasing look with a well-balanced and decently complex malt and hop combination to the palate.","  rDev Very nice, easy-to-drink sessionable IPA.

The aroma and flavors match: grapefruit and grapefruit zest, very dank hop notes. The bitterness is moderate.  This brew varies in flavor a bit.","  rDev Clear, deep gold, thick white head with good retention and lace A little grapefruit, a little pine, malt character definitely comes through Pretty much tastes like it smells Medium body and carbonation It's funny how this beer was so big of a deal 10-15 years ago, and now its just meh. Not bad at all, just more of a window into what was considered  extreme  in the past, and how quickly the industry has developed","  rDev I asked the server at Roosters in Grove City, Ohio, what was on tap the day I was there. After running down the entire list of macro swill, she said,  Dogfish...  I said I'd have that. Turned out to be 60 Minute. Typical restaurant pour: standard pint glass, minimal head. Slightly hazy amber color, with a white head (what there was of it). Absolutely wonderful aromas and flavors of pine and citrus, with notes of tropical fruit and light caramel. Very well balanced, with a solid malt backbone to support the hop bitterness. Medium bodied, clean finish. This is one fantastic beer!","  rDev Oh man, this should be the IPA that new IPA drinkers work their way towards. Every aspect of this beer is perfectly matched. Rich amber look, confident nose without being dominate, taste....well the taste is why nobody buys this beer just once. Super balanced and a bargain at $9.99 for a 6-pak.","  rDev I liked the new label. Amber color with a thick head with great retention and leaving lots of laces. Nice piney aroma with notes of lychees, stone fruit, a bit of caramel and dough. Flavor with notes of stone fruit, pine, grapefruit citrusy, lychees, caramel and biscuit malt, spices, melon and tangerines. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. This American IPA is original and elegant with lots of white fruits, citrusy and piney notes. Its bitterness is very flavorful and not harsh at all. I couldn’t resist to wash down their reliable six-pack.","  rDev Decanted from 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into 16 oz plastic conical pint at Dagger John's in Bronx, NY. A: Pours a very slightly hazy, light copper color with a, no more than quarter inch head and minimal lacing, although the  glass  may have contributed.  S: Aromas of lemon citrus, caramel, and pine. Maybe a whiff of tutti-fruity at points.  T: Tastes of caramel malt subsumed by citrus: lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine all present. Relatively light bitterness in excellent balance with overall flavor profile.  M: Light to medium bodied with moderate to strong carbonation. Crisp and clean finish. O: This is a go to EC IPA. Clearly less complex than the 90 minute or all day versions, but very drinkable. I would not hesitate to order/drink/serve/share.","  rDev 12oz bottled 9/25/17 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours bright golden orange amber in color with a thick, sticky, nearly white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is citrus leaning more toward orange or lemon. The taste is semisweet caramel up front with a lemony, earthy slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Finishes with an almost tea-like feel. Overall, very good. A good reference for what was ground breaking 15-20 years ago on the east coast.","  rDev L: Clear golden orange with a solid white head. Moderate retention, good lacing.  S: Dank and weedy, earth, grassy, and piney. A slightly toasty malt backbone with hints of caramel. Hints of generic citrus, particularly orange peel and pith. A slight metallic, copper-like aroma.   T: Orange and grapefruit peel upfront, along with some pine, earth, and grass. Slightly toasty malt backbone with hints of caramel. Well-balanced between citrusy, earthy, and piney hop flavors and a moderate malt backbone. There is that slight copper taste. Finishes only momentarily bitter, and lightly dry.  F: Medium-light body, medium-high carbonation, well-rounded and cleanses the palate nicely.  O: An iconic IPA for a reason. Well-balanced, acceptable to hopheads and malt lovers alike. Not too bitter, but not sweet, either.","  rDev This beer pours a deep gold with a decent head. The aroma leads with caramel, the fresh barley, cannabis, pine, and burnt orange. The flavor starts with a lovely bitter pine quality, then black tea, raw grain, orange peel, green tea, and wet moss. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a very tasty beer - not as bold and fruity as modern versions, but simple and layered at the same time."]},{"Name":"Pale Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/276/","Brewery":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","Style":"Pale Ale - American","Alcohol":5.60,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled 4/29/21  Man, it's a shock to me that I've never actually reviewed this legendary brew. One of my gateway beers into craft in 2018, which despite not being very long ago feels like a lifetime ago for a younger person such as myself. So given the site-wide tasting today, it's time to give this old classic/consistent go-to beer at restaurants a proper review  Pours a slightly cloudy amber gold with 2 fingers of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  For me personally, the nose is always the star of the show for this beer, really tying it all together with an exceptional balance of malt and hops. I'm picking up on aromas of piney hops, caramel malt, pithy grapefruit, orange zest, and light lemon  Oh man, what an iconic tasting beer. As I said, not quite as incredible as the aroma, but still nicely balanced. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh piney hops, lemon peel, orange zest, bready malt, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of pithy grapefruit, bready malt, toasted grain, floral peppery hops, and orange zest  A light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp yet full beer. Finishes mostly dry with a light spice to offset the malt  A beer more than the sum of its parts, an institution even. It's a classic for a reason, and I'm glad we have a day to celebrate it. Cheers!","  rDev Sampling a chilled 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. The beer is packaged 5/2021.  The beer pours a clear amber to copper color with an eggshell white fluffy head of 3 cm that fades slowly to a rocky surface layer and some clingy lattice. The foam sticks around as a sturdy surface layer throughout the tasting. Some very fine lazy streams of carbonation are rising to the surface. The aroma is some pine notes and a bit of grapefruit rind dominate, but I do get a little caramel and grainy bread note coming through the nose. First sip reveals a medium body and very fine gentle rolling carbonation. Fairly soft texture and very easy drinking. Flavor is some crisp hop bite of pine sap and grapefruit rind which rolls to some milder caramel notes in the background. Finish is pretty clean but a lingering hop bite leaves a bitter note across my palate. Also a very drying finish. No hint of any ABV and the beer is very easy to drink. Glad to try this one again, AND finally review this beer. Will remember this one as an option when I want some dry hop bite in a beer.","  rDev 12 oz can. Packaged in Mills River on June 04, 2021  L: Amber in color, fluffy white head. Noticed (transfixed by) two small streams of bubbles flowing in parallel from the bottom of the glass to the surface. Left a moderate level of lacing. S: Primarily piney resin intertwined with a slight citrus presence. Caramel malt combines with those characteristics to give a nice, pleasant aroma. T: Mostly getting a piney, resinous character giving off a slight bitterness. Perhaps some citrus as a secondary characteristic but it's light to me and seems to give clear deference to the piney resinous aspect. Malt presence is perfect for this beer imo. F: A creamy feel gives way to a slight oily finish. moderate carbonation. O: SNPA is considered a classic for good reason. It's a delicious beer even to this day.","  rDev Bottled 5/07  Finally getting around to trying this. First off, this is a beautiful beer. Crystal clear with a big rocky head that leaves lots of sticky lace in its wake. And damned if it isn't tasty as hell! Clean with no off flavors. Prickly citrus rind and a nice lingering tingly pine note. Love the stiff caramel backbone. Very easy to drink too fast. This must have been absolutely revelatory back in the day and it's damn good today.","  rDev Excellent amber body; very clear; plenty of lively carbonation; thick head, dense and creamy. Enticing smell; pine, citrus, floral; low-key sweet malt notes in the background. Nice, balanced flavors; big pine resin note; fresh orange; light and bright malt taste; mild sweetness throughout; moderate to bold hop bitterness. Medium body; crisp with a mild prickliness on the palate; some stickiness overall yet also has a rather dry mouthfeel throughout.  This is not my first SN pale ale, but it has been years since I last had one. I love the balance between the malt bill and hop bill. One finds some interesting depth and complexity in the beer. At nearly three months of age, this beer is quite enjoyable.  Served at 52 F; bottle label data: PKGD 04/16/21","  rDev Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, 5.6% ABV. Pours clear orange with a two finger white head that left some lacing. Nose is citrus, malt, and pine. Taste is citrus and pine, slight sweetness, moderate to heavy bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall excellent.","  rDev SN Pale Ale is one of the first  IPA  I ever drank when I first got into craft beer. At that time I didn't like any IPAs and petty much avoided them completely. I actually didn't like SNPA the first time I had it, but after having a couple more I came to appreciate the balance this beer provides. It was definitely one of the  gateway   IPAs  that eventually got me to like these hoppier beers. Its funny though, because as the style changes and shifts, I find myself often craving a SNPA as what I really want from an IPA. (And yea, I know its a pale ale, not an IPA, but its easiest to refer to the general category).  This bottle I am drinking today was packaged on 5/21/21. It pours a lovely burnished orange color. Mostly clear, but there are some yeast particulates creating a slight cloudiness. A thick frothy buff head forms on the beer, lingers momentarily, then dissipates leaving just a ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Aroma has light nots of citrus, orange and grapefruit. There is a certain maltiness to the nose, but its quite balanced. Whisps of honey tinge the aroma providing a light sweetness.  Taste has notes of citrus up front - orange and grapefruit - transitioning into some pine and green hop notes. The bitterness is there, but pretty mild - again tit comes across as balanced. Notes of lightly toasted biscuit malts provide the back bone to the beer. Feel is light, smooth and easy drinking. Moderate, but very smooth, carbonation.  Overall this is the classic pale ale. I was drinking this one this morning and kept thinking to myself  why don't I drink this more often?  its better than the vast majority of high priced IPAs I buy. If anything this tasting was a good reminder to me to drink this more often than I do.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Label has 'PKGD 02/11/21'. Mostly clear, deep gold colored body. One finger of white bubbly head. Leaves rings of lacing. Aroma of lightly toasted malts and citrus/piney hops. Taste is balanced with toasty malt and hops that express pine and citrus (orange and grapefruit). All of this continues into the aftertaste. Bitter and sweet. Medium mouth feel, with just a touch of syrup. Very good carbonation. Classic pale ale that has been the introduction for many to the craft beer world. Yummy good.","  rDev How can it be that I've never reviewed this classic? At least I can put this in contemporary perspective, with this once outlier brew now being centrist.   Less unusual now than decades ago but the excellent balance and well chosen mix of ingredientsstill deserve high ratings, particularly for the style.","  rDev Drinking this at home. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Looks light amber in color with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap. Smells lightly bready, spicy. Taste follows the nose nicely, more spicy, hoppy like an IPA. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall I would definitely drink again. It's a good go to beer when shopping because of its widespread availability. Cheers!","  rDev Deep gold, white head, excellent retention and lace Floral, grapefruit and pine hop aromas, a bit of caramel malt underneath Nice grapefruit hop flavor on a solid caramel malt backbone Medium bodied, clean, and properly carbonated. A classic for a reason","  rDev L - Frothy, golden, see-through, with enough lacing and head for enjoying several minutes worth. S - Great pine, citrus, forest floor scents, and some good malt whiff in balance here. T - Classic light-bitter and forest malt tastes here, still the one.  F - Great mouthfeel, balance, never out of whack and USUALLY fresh at local stores. Has the same palate impact of old school IPAs back in the day, but with a brightness the latter could not match. O - still a great drinking pale ale, after all these years.","  rDev I've had this many times, but never as a side by side with the other coast's storied Pale Ale, Hill Farmstead Edward, which many know as having taken its inspiration from SNPA. Actually having the opportunity to do this head to head with Hill finally canning Edward is a blessing in the middle of a pandemic, but finding that it only elevated both beers in unique ways was even more pleasant of a surprise, so I couldn't help but completely delete and redo my old review of this reliable standby, as the comparisons and contrasts are very enjoyable to take note of.  While Edward is a hazy, nearly fully opaque pale amber-orange with a moderate, creamy khaki head, SNPA is sparkling clear darker amber with a slightly taller, slightly darker khaki foam head that collapses under large airy bubbles.  The similarities are present, yes. Edward is a little more bitter and a little more maltier than most of Hill's hoppy brews, or many other NEPAs/IPAs, which is in line with elements of SNPA, itself further diverging by being toastier and adding very mild notes of caramel and pine resinous aftershave.  However, the differences are stark. Drastically stark.  Edward is creamier, fuller, and juicier. It almost has a vanilla cream quality by comparison, with that Hill yeast and shortbread-like malt combination. It even has a hint of that bubblegum character to it that I always get in Tree House brews, and rarely get elsewhere, which is the biggest surprise to me here.  Either way, none of that takes away from SNPA, which is a high quality beer that's immensely crushable for a relatively bitter ale with a respectable complexity and insane shelf life. It may even be the preferred option for some, such as my old lady, who enjoyed SNPA more for it's drinkability in this head to head. With that in mind, Edward does feel heavier, but it's so delicious I wouldn't change a thing about it either. SNPA's signature but measured and crisp West Coast bitterness clearly sets it apart, and its reliability for when you need a quality  beer flavored beer  that has that nice mild bite to it is unmatched.","  rDev 12oz bottle, dated 05.06.2020, poured into a stemless wine glass.  The beer pours a very nice amber color, copper and orange hues, slight chill haze and some bubbles racing around the beer with about a finger and a half of white frothy head that has good retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is very nice, pine, orange peel, grapefruit juice, a bit grassy with a nice assertive amber malt character. The flavors are good, strong grains lead the way, pale dough and amber cereal grains with a nice crisp grapefruit character, some soft floral and fruitiness comes out before the bitter pine and grapefruit peel start to take over, earthy and grassy at the finish. The mouthfeel is very good, coating with a lively medium body that finishes with a crisp and dry bite.  Verdict: The quintessential west coast style pale ale. After years of experimentation and evolution within the industry, this might seem boring or pedestrian but it's certainly one of the most sessionable and flavorful pale ales and there is good reason why this is the standard to which so many beers get compared.","  rDev Bottle with retro artwork, bottled 05 Mar. Been forever since I've had one.   A gorgeous copper with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and exceptional lacing. The nose is excellent. Bright, sharp grapefruit, candied orange, a touch of pine, all tempered by a delicate caramel sweetness. The palate opens moderately bitter with the classic Cascade hop flavor, but without much of the chalkiness I remember. Clean, bright, moderately pungent with orange, grapefruit, a little pine, a delicate sweetness with a light caramel and honey note. The mid palate is dominated by the sweeter flavors duking it out with the bitterness. Let's call it a tie. Drying, bitter, clean and vibrant on the finish, the mouthfeel is initially a little thin and overcarbonated but once it dies down, this is a pleasure. Quite excellent, truly a classic.","  rDev This one was a little disappointing considering how popular it is. I expected a little more from this great brand. No date printed on bottle. Pours a slightly medium darker golden color with a little fluffy white head and some spotty lingering lacing that lasted for a while. Smells of muddled fruity and floral hops, caramel, weaker malt, vanilla, bread and maybe a touch of herbal hops at the finish. Taste follows the nose, ok balance but I wish there were more depth and complexity. Also seemed to lack a decent hoppy bitter bite. Smooth, mild mouthfeel with fairly good carbonation. I wish I knew how old this beer was and it did seem that it could’ve used a little more strength in its hoppiness.","  rDev L- Mid to dark amber, clear. Pours with 1Cm pillowy white head (holds very well). S- Hmm, apart from a 'beer' fragrance I don't get anything specific or distinctive from it at all - a bit of a surprise. T- It's a grown up APA. It has moderate dry hopping but is not OTT as some comtemporary iterations of the style can be. Neither does it use hops that bring in bonkers (to me) lychee, mango or other out of place fruit facets. F- It has some meatiness to it, some decent presence.  O- It's pretty good, drinkable and sessionable. But it's not that distinct or full of character (IMO) to warrant the ratings it seems to attract. Maybe it works better in the US at US prices, vs US competition vs abroad where it's a $-premium import facing different competition? Bought from WholeFoods, London W8. £1.80/355ml bottle.","  rDev From the back label of the bottle:  PKGD 07/22/19 1708   Appearance: The body is a light gold color with good clarity. The head is thick, white, and frothy. It has perfect head formation, retention, and lacing.  Aroma: There is a light lemon zest aroma with a touch of lime.  Taste: The beer has a noticeable lime flavor with a bit of pine in the back and just a hint of alcohol. Lemon comes through in the aftertaste and lingers around for a while. The flavors in the beer definitely make one sit up and take notice.  Mouthfeel: It is a very refreshing beer with a lighter body and a pleasant effervescence. It is a very enjoyable beer to drink.  Overall: Simply put, this beer is tasty and enjoyable. This is a very multi-purpose beer when it comes to food recommendations, where it would pair with anything from a hamburger to a cheese tray. The bottle seems to have held up very nicely flavor-wise for being just under three months old, so I would definitely recommend it within that timeframe or sooner. I would drink it again but I would like to try it on tap or from a can. It's a very enjoyable beer.","  rDev From old, undated notes. Poured from the can.   Murky light yellow color.   Foamy white head; strong lacing.   Light hops in the nose, malts also present.   Light mouthfeel.   Taste is slightly lager-ish, malty &amp; not much hops.   I'd slam one on a hot day but I won't be reaching for another anytime soon.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a standard tap glass.   Pours nearly crystal clear bronze with an outstanding foamy head, great retention and excellent lacing.   Malts, hops, and grains all swirl around the nose in well-balanced and equal measures.   The brew hits the tongue with a slightly sweet and spicy malt flavor. The mid-palate enjoys spicy grainy yeast. The finish is a nice, earthy dry hop note. Overall, a well-balanced, restrained flavor.  The feel is medium-light to medium, with excellent carbonation and a nice drying finish.   This was one of the first craft beers I ever tried, many years ago. This is the first time I've had one in 10 years. It still stands up. APA's can be  shy  on flavor. Not this classic. It may lack some of the nuance of more recent offerings, but this is one of the most well-balanced brews I've had.","  rDev A normal amber color, no head but ample carbonation. Terrific aroma. Great hop smell. The taste is excellent and very hoppy. Mouthfeel is only slightly bitter and compliments the taste in this pale ale. Overall an excellent choice for Pale Ales when you’re in the mood.","  rDev Bottled on 3/5/19  Pours a clear golden orange-copper topped with a few fingers of tightly-composed white foam; great retention that trickles its way down to a thick, frothy cap while leaving layers of webby lacing following to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma hits with smooth, semi-sweet caramel malt upfront, eventually giving way to deep pine, herbal hops, red grapefruit, and orange zest developing in that order; a potent and drying bouquet.  Taste shows crisp caramel malts balanced with sharp piney hops and a touch of citrusy grapefruit on the back end; hints of wild berries develop fervently around/on the swallow.  Mouthfeel has a light, crisp body reinforced with fluffy, drying carbonation; brief heft on the mid-palate serves only to guide this one to a new height, an immensely satisfying dryness tinged with a faint, bitter hoppiness; for a pale ale, this is about as good as it gets.  A seminal pale ale for a reason, it holds up with its incredible malt-hop harmony and dynamic simplicity; it does alot without ever abandoning its easy-drinking nature. An effortless beer for all occasions.","  rDev Pours a beautiful clear amber, thin white head and active carbonation. Smell is malty sweet with notes of apple, pine and caramel. Very pleasantly cohesive and complex.  Taste is wonderfully crisp, piney and grassy notes lead, into a lightly caramel/rich malt body, it all tails of into a piney/citrusy hop finish. Classic for a reason, this is a taste that is hard to get sick of. Mouthfeel is super clean, definitely a drinker. Leaves nothing but refreshment behind.  Overall this is an undisputable classic in the american beer market. For those of us deep in the modern craft scene it can seem out dated or passe but as someone deep in a stint of modern IPAs and big stouts I can testify to the refreshing, crisp delight this beer still brings. Don't be scared, it's just a classic","  rDev From notes 11/10/12: Pours clear amber producing a finger of creamy, rapidly diminishing, off-white head that leaves pasty rings of lace. Aroma is pale and light bready malt with floral and citrus hops. Taste is similar but more robust with citrus and a little pine in the hop profile. Finishes dry, astringent, peppery and bitter.","  rDev Nice evenhanded brew. Well balanced malt vs. hops. Comes away on the hoppy side but not overbearing. Not in anyway exciting to look at. Gentle aroma of caramel malt is quite appetizing. Easy drinking, well made.","  rDev Bottle poured into a teku glass  Clear copper liquid, micro streams of carbonation, two finger off white foam cap, good lacings   Aroma is spicy, mild pepper,   Spicy hops over a good malt grain taste   Slight bitterness, hop nibble, slightly dry  Good beer","  rDev L: Slightly hazy amber color, three finger white head, nice lacing, good carbonation.  S: Hops, malts, yeast.  T: Hoppy, malty.  F: Light bodied, extremely drinkable and refreshing.  O: Pretty good APA.","  rDev Pours a clear, deep gold/light amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells faintly of biscuity, bready malt, with a certain graininess coming through as well and the merest hint of citrus and pine. Taste is a good balance of biscuity malt and citrus hops, with just a hint of pine coming through and an underlaying grainy and slightly flowery note. Finishes with crisp, light/medium bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation.  I feel that the beer is actually supposed to have this slightly understated malt/hop presence, which is kind of typical of a classic, old school Pale Ale, I suppose. It's well balanced, crisp and easy-drinking."]},{"Name":"Stone IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/88/","Brewery":"Stone Brewing","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":6.90,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev On tap at Yard House.

Lovely hoppy aroma, notes of citrus and tropical fruits. The zesty and fruity flavour is distinctly hoppy from start to finish, on a sufficient malty background. Ends in a grapefruity bitterness, but it is not overdone. Long bitter aftertaste. More to my liking than the Arrogant Bastard. Good stuff!","  rDev The 6-pack was packaged on 6/3/20, so just over 9 weeks old at the time of this review (on 8/8/20).  Aroma is orange - almost sweet, hints of piney notes accompanying. A light toasty aroma underneath.  Orange-amber color, with a chill haze, ample rising bubbles to a creamy off-white head with very good retention. Nice-looking disconnected lacing. The chill haze eventually dissipates to a clear amber color.  Taste has the citrus rind (orange) biting up front, backed by some floral and orange juice flavors. The floral appears mostly as aroma that accompanies each swish in the mouth. There is sufficient malt presence, toasty bread, to provide the needed balance, but clearly the hops are the name of the game with this beer. The beer is not bitter for the first sip or two, but the bitterness builds with each successive drink to become a quite bitter beer. The aftertaste lingers for a long while and is intensely bitter.  The beer has substantial body for the style.  Overall, a very good IPA, and deserving of its iconic status in the West Coast substyle. To my palate, the bitterness is most evident in the lingering aftertaste than in the flavor of each sip itself. The bitter aftertaste comes to dominate everything before you are finished.","  rDev I am no big fan of Stone's but I have to admit, this is a very nice IPA.   Pours a crystal clear brilliant golden color. Nice 3 or 4 finger head settles in then quickly dissolves leaving just a mound ring of foam along the outside of the beer. Not a ton of lacing is left behind.   Aroma has bright notes of grapefruit, pine, dried grass, and a bit of sweet light malt.   Taste follows the nose with notes of pine, pine needles and grapefruit, with again, a bit of that malt peeping through. So far this has been the  maltiest  of the beers I've tried over the last day and a half, but lets be honest, it is by no means a  malty  IPA. Pronounced bitterness tarts on the back end and lingers into the finish.   Feel is light to medium bodied, pretty dry throughout producing a coating sensation in the mouth.   Overall its a really nice IPA and a worthy example of the style.","  rDev A go to whenever I want a WCIPA. Consistently good ale from a consistently good brewer.

Great hop finish.","  rDev A - Nice bright, medium to dark gold color, perfect clarity, creamy white lacing on top with great head retention, carbonation is light and steady.  S - Light caramel malt with a piney, citrus presence on the nose.  T - Strong caramel malt backbone up front until midway through when the pine and citrus roll in like a freight train and continues to roll even far past the sip down the 'ol pie hole. Long lingering pine bite with some citrus washes away and malt sweetness that was experienced up front. On the very, very back side some of that malt tries to resurface but with little success.   M - Big and full and the tongue with light carbonated pricklies and finishes dry on the back of the tongue.  O - A classic that never gets old.","  rDev Looks very slightly hazy and had a nice head. Aroma is good but weak. The taste is fair. More IPA like and hops are smooth. It’s good on the palate and smooth. Overall an excellent IPA. On draft at BJ’s Brewhouse.","  rDev Bottled on 2/25/19  Pours a slightly cloudy orange-copper body topped with a finger or so of taut, off-white foam; good retention results in an expansive distribution of webby lacing, a light cap, and a frothy, bubbly collar.  Aromas of raw, deep pine, evergreen, and a subtle but immovable foundation of flaky crisp malt; slight dank earth hangs in the background along with some tropical undertones; forest personified in a beer.  Taste profile is evergreen and pine needles, with grapefruit zest coming in to even out the advancing, raw earthiness of it all; bits of herbal weediness follow in tow; bitter hops and a building malt punch mature with the profile as a whole.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a moderate, dry carbonation; vaguely bitter; coats the palate tactfully with a smooth, herbaceous grit, while simultaneously, a juicy pop grows throughout and culminates near the finish.  Stiff but deceptively approachable paragon of old-school hops. I can’t speak of this beer before the Virginia expansion; I just know what I’m drinking now is one fine, expressive IPA, and I’d gladly drink more of it.","  rDev Served in a Bottle  Pine aroma  Pine hop taste is hops over malt base   Hop taste lingers, doesn’t bite but Nibbles .

Lots of aggressive pine notes, but with a nice citrus kick in there to keep it from being one-note. Not too shabby","  rDev Poured from a single-serve into a pub glass.  Pours a classic amber-gold with a fine two-finger head and good lacing. Just a hint of haze.   The aromas are subdued, but excellent. Grapefruit citrus and oily pine resin hops in equal measures meld with just a hint of crackery malt--not sweetness, but just enough maltiness to balance.  The flavor is skewed hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Floral hops hit the beginning of the sip, with citrus (grapefruit flesh and pith) rounding out the middle palate, and oily pine hops and a touch of booze at the finish. The malts present on the nose are, again, just barely noticeable here.  The mouthfeel is excellent. Medium-bodied with a fine crisp finish.  I don't remember the last time I had one of these, but it would good to revisit an old-timer. There are certainly better and more creative offerings of the style now, but this is a solid rock.","  rDev Pours clear gold, thin white head. not much in the way of retention or lace.

This may be brewed in Richmond but it's basically the perfect West Coast IPA - a nice hoppy, piney, citrusy bite well-balanced with a caramel malt backbone (with very little sweetness). This classic beats the pants off the vast majority of new-school IPAs (whether NE-style or not).","  rDev From notes 4/1/12: Pours a hazy burnt orange producing a 1.5 inch, long lasting beige head that leaves super lacing. Aroma is hop heaven with caramel malt and resinous tones. Taste is up front various hop flavor, bite and bitterness with subtle caramel malt and a dry finish. A solid IPA.","  rDev Pours a deep golden amber coloration with a large frothy head. Smells mainly of hoppy grapefruit and orange notes, with a hint of pine as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by hoppy grapefruit and orange rind notes, but with quite a resinous character, light caramel malt and strong pine as well. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and quite a bit of pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This is the quintessential West Coast IPA with its resinous character and notes of grapefruit, pine and caramel malt. Probably the best value-for-money IPA in Germany, if you can find it fresh.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a tulip  A- pours a clear golden color with a two-finger foamy white head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind  S- citrusy hops lead the way with grapefruit and orange zest, along with grassy notes and pine resin, light undertones of toasted malt  T- citrus grapefruit zest and tangy orange up front, followed by pine resin and grass. Mid-palate gives a hint of honey sweetness, the finish gives more citrus hops and toasted malt  M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly creamy finish, high drinkability  O- the quintessential west coast ipa, and one that never gets old","  rDev Pours a clear dark yellow with two fingers of off-white foam that retains well. Aroma is pine, dank, and resin hops with biscuit malts behind. Hops are biting, but not aggressive. Flavor profile is resin, dank, pine, and orange hops with biscuit and bread malts behind. It's clean, and while the hops bite a little, they are wonderfully balanced and blended into the beer. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a soft, velvety texture that lends itself to joyful sip after sip. Overall, a splendid, balanced IPA that hits traditional West Coast IPA hop notes. Classic, and for a good reason.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16.9oz can.","  rDev Crystal clear body; golden hued; fat carbonation bubbles. dense, rocky head. Spicy, malty nose; dank grass. The taste strongly follows the aroma; peppery and bitter; subtle bread crust base. Medium body; sharp and nearly biting; some grain warmth; overall dry.  Wow! Did this really kind of start the west coast IPA thing? And after all these years, is this really the first time I've tried this beer?? Who knows and who really cares. What is important is that this beer does deliver the sharp, poignant IPA bitterness that one would look for in an American IPA. I didn't find any freshness dating on the bottle, but it certainly delivers the goods. A fine beer; a classic beer.","  rDev My son got me a bomber for Father’s Day. Poured into a tulip glass.cloudy golden yellow color with a fantastically fluffy head and lovely lacing.   Strong pine smell. Tastes of bourbon, grapefruit and orange. Very warming for an IPA. Enjoyed it very much! Thanks, son!","  rDev 2/18/18: Purchased 16 oz draft pour with the Cheeseburger, Onion Rings and Beer $19.95 Special at Burger Brasserie in the Bally's / Paris Walkway. Murky orange pour, white puffy cloud head. Firm hops aroma, citrus offsets the hops. Firm hops taste, pleasant bitterness, citrus slightly offsets the hops. Thin mouth feel, easy drinking. Overall very good IPA","  rDev IPA brewed by Stone Brewing, with an ABV of 6.90% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, and earthy grains and malts. This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The look and smell are really inviting. Now for the taste, it is Bold with hop bitterness at first. Then you pick up a smoothness of earthy grains and malts at the end. There is alot going on in Stone IPA. If you are not a fan of hops, this is not the brew for you. The body of Stone IPA, is a medium to heavy. But not to heavy. There is a super nice balance to this brew, there is nothing overpowering about this American. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to Stone IPA a solid 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Stone Brewing, did a super nice job with American IPA.","  rDev IPA pours a darker copper color, with a big lacing and long lasting head. Balanced aroma, but aggressive. Flavor is the same, balanced, but aggressive, lots of malts and lots of hops that are not overpowered. Good body and feel. Overall, well constructed, balanced, but strong and aggressive.","  rDev I recently had a Stone IPA at a Pub here in Oklahoma City but I've had it many times before. It is without question a moderately hoppy but good IPA.  Look: golden yellow/orange hue with a pretty good white foamy head  Aroma: caramel sweetness and citrus  Taste: caramel sweetness, grapefruit, moderate pine resin that remains  Feel: light to medium body","  rDev Pours a clear golden color. Head is 1 finger, white, frothy, and retention is excellent.  The nose has a nice citrus aroma. Taste is citrusy. Grapefruit, and just a very slight pine taste on the backside.  Feel is decent. Some feel of the hops on the way down. A delicious IPA overall. Nothing wrong with it, and we'll made.","  rDev 12oz bottled 11/30/17 RVA poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6.9% ABV. The beer pours bright light straw orange yellow in color with abundant off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is citrus and a hint of caramel malt. The taste caramel and citrus up front with a bit of pine. The finish is dry and pleasantly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied and adequately carbonated. There is a hoppy, slightly sticky bitterness that rests on the palate after the beer is swallowed. Overall, very good.","  rDev This beer represents something special: Stone IPA, launched 20 years ago (I was still in high school at that time, I feel old now) it soon became the zeitgeist brew that grew immensely in stature on a certain website launched by two passionate beer-drinking brothers... you know the one I’m talking about - that site. So I’m going in to this review with a certain amount of reverence that will hopefully not become the folly of hype by the end of this page. However that’s hardly likely to happen with Stone “Xocoveza-Vertical-Epic-W00tstout-Americano” Brewing, those legends of San Diego (which of course in German means a whale's vagina) who don’t seem to brew any bad beers, least none that I’ve encountered [yet!]. Anyway: My beer awaits.  Poured from a 355ml can into a nonic pint.  A: Hazy amber body, like the sun rising between misty hills at golden hour. With an off-white thatch-work half centimetre head that leaves a nice sticky lace on the side of the glass. This is a damn-near perfect looking IPA, one that Pale Ales hope to look like when they grow up. 9/10.  S: Aroma is a dynamite piney/caramel combo with a hint of dried apricot and citrus leading me further down the rabbit hole. Top-notch fragrance, quintessentially West Coast... hell this is the original West Coast, so of course the aroma matches the ambition of this brew. It’s got a touch of hop fade... would love to have this fresh (can date: 17/02/17 - that’s over 5 months old now). 8/10.  T: Big citrus bite upfront, full piney/earthy notes, broad caramel base, dried apricot hint leading towards an assertive, almost aggressive, bitter finish. It’s balls to the walls this beer! Rather than be overly malty as other brews I’ve noticed with hop fade this one appears to have fared a little better - it’s only a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste that ruins an otherwise impeccable West Coast IPA. 8/10.  M: Feel is good, it’s got a bit of (Johnny) Dep(p)th to it, medium bodied, and an almost German-like carbonation (i.e. not quite but almost creamy). 9/10.  D: I get this beer. It started a “Generation X” wave of brewing beers that were bitter, tasty, and all round a bit of a handful (or glassful if we’re going to be technical here). However I now look back upon these early West Coast IPAs as the age of beers that were challenging, and at times too much for me, and I look forward to the ever growing popularity of New England IPAs which strike a perfect balance between sweet/bitter - which is my favourite beer balance. Huzzah! 9/10.  Food match: Go for some spicy buffalo wings with this brew.","  rDev Pours a clear amber color with a medium sized, stable head.  The nose is defined by fruity hops, oranges, lemon peel and cakey malts to highlight the hops. Classical nose for an ipa, a very enjoyable though.   Perfectly balanced, well carbonated bright and thirst quenching with a nice taste evolution regarding the evolving hop profile.  Bitter from the first glance, without pushing too far, due to balancing, sweeter malts. The hops are pretty fruity but foremost dry, bitter and in your face. Finishes soft, still dry but with a caramel malt sweetness cutting through.  Pretty wow, one the most well build west coast ipas I ve ever had. It is uncompromisingly bitter, while still caring for remaining drinkable, which is acoomplished by the noteable malts.","  rDev Golden amber. Slight haze. Thick frothy head which subsides in about a minute. Rich tropical and citrus fruit (tangerine) aroma. Some phenol.  Nicely subdued version of the bouquet. Light astringency to finish. Moderate to thick body. Quite smooth. Archetypal West Coast IPA (but brewed in Germany). I wonder how close this is to the original?","  rDev Stone IPA v1.1 12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance Blonde. Good clarity. Medium-light carbonation.  Nose Grapefruit, papaya, lemon, navel orange, dough, honey, and caramel.  Taste Grapefruit zest and white grapefruit juice. Pine needles, navel orange, and lemon slices. Hints of papaya. Firm caramel, doughy bread, and honey maltiness.  Mouthfeel Medium-plus bodied, oily, crisp, off-dry, and moderately bitter.  Overall I like the new iteration of Stone IPA. It adds more fruit juiciness while keeping some malt complexity."]},{"Name":"Torpedo Extra IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/30420/","Brewery":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.20,"Score":92.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled 9/7/21. so about 9 weeks old.  lightly hazy orange, with 1.5 fingers of long-lasting head, that leaves a 1/4 ring, some surface sheeting, and a 1  ring of spotty lacing.

Never understood why it doesn't get more love","  rDev Bottled 1/29/20  Seems like this is a night full of discount rack beers, as I just had Red Flag from Heavy Seas. It was disappointing to say the least, but could be attributed to freshness. However, for this beer being nearly 8 months old, the price of $1 is not surprising. Still, I'm sure it held up better than the last  Pours a cloudy orange copper with 2 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  There's a decent amount of sweetness in the nose here, with caramel malt and brown sugar balancing out dank, resiny hops with mild notes of lemon and grapefruit. A simple aroma but very nice  The hops go from heavy to mind blowingly heavy over the course of the sip, and this is an old bottle! At first, the piney hops are balanced out by subtle honey and a touch of spice. On the swallow, it turns to straight up resiny, oily hops, even a bit too much for my palate. Not necessarily bad, but it just feels like overkill  This has a medium body and mild carbonation that leads to a smooth drink, even with all the hop bitterness. Almost entirely drying on the finish and quite bitter  I'm a little conflicted with this one. I think it had good flavor, but I prefer more balance in my IPAs. I know this is a preference thing and many disagree, but it's just how I like it. Regardless, I do think it's well made and not half bad","  rDev 12 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with a average white head of small bubbles that leave a sticky lacing in my glass.

Medium bodied, easy drinking.","  Drinking this at home due to the ongoing pandemic and the fact that you can not go out to get a proper pint. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appears amber, clear, with a nice foamy head and lacing that lasted. Smells floral, piney, lightly bready. Taste follows the nose, all balanced, together. Mouth feel is medium for the style with good carbonation. Overall, a very nice American IPA that I would definitely order again.","  rDev Poured from a can into a nonic glass.  Pours a dark orange--nearly amber--with a great fluffy and creamy white head that lasts for several minutes. Even after it subsides, there is some nice soapy foamy lacing.   Classic down the middle American IPA aromas. Grapefruit, evergreen, guarded caramel and pale malts, and hints of floral and earthy hops.  The brew's flavor follows the nose, and is well-balanced. Caramel malts hit the tip of the tongue first, but are quickly balanced by some firm but not heavy-handed hop notes from all quarters--earthy, floral, evergreen, and citrusy. Pale malts in midstream. A touch of white pepper and herbal/chive flavor at the finish, along with a bit of warming alcohol.   The brew has a great feel. Solid and medium-bodied, it still has a naturally drying quality that mates well with good carbonation to make this very drinkable, although a 7+% probably shouldn't be called sessionable.  A well-balanced approach to the style that has an excellent dry finish that makes it really drinkable.","  rDev Burnt orange coloured ale, with totally gorgeous creamy thick creme coloured head. Hoppy aroma of course, but not  in your face softer, like spruce tips. Very spicy hop taste to it, very livelly and carbonated well ( not to muchj.

There is a bit of pine and floral with a slight bit of grainy sweetness in the background.   Feel: It has a medium body and a slight alcohol warming.   Overall, great flavors yet very easy drinking due to the pleasant, not harsh, bitterness.","  rDev Surprised I had not previously reviewed this beer.   Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Clear golden yellow color with great head and beautiful lacing. Piney smell and taste. Citrusy and earthy. Excellent beer!","  rDev Nice crisp slightly bitter IPA, enjoyable but not particularly amazing. Pours a nice lighter amber color with a little head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells a little more faintly of some nice citrus zest hops and some weaker floral hops. Tastes similarly, along with some malt, caramel, piney hops and bread. Smooth thin mouthfeel, good carbonation. Again, nice and easy to drink, just not particularly memorable. Certainly, I was expecting something “extra” and this beer just never delivered.","  rDev Pours a chill hazed deep amber producing 3 fingers of frothy, beige head which recedes to leave sticky coating of webby lace. Aroma is citrus, pine &amp; herbal/leafy hops, fruity with a sweet caramel malt note. Taste is caramel malt sweet balanced with pine heavy, light citrus &amp; herbal hops. There is a leafy dank hint &amp; pepper in the latter half of the sip. There's something a little tropical here also. It finishes bittersweet and fades to dry &amp; increasing bitterness.

A: Pours a clear, dark amber color with orange highlights and a foamy, light wheat colored head, solid retention, and excellent lacing. S: Aromas of grapefruit and pine, but earthier and woodsier that many IPAs. T: The palate certainly follow the nose, but the caramel/molasses/bready malt core is now front and center. M: Medium bodied with excellent carbonation and full, creamy presence. O: A top shelf American IPA. My buddy tells me he buys it by the case. Maybe I should.","  rDev How have I never rated this before?!?? But anyway....  L: Clear amber with a fluffy off white head. Good retention. Sheets of lacing.  S: Very woodsy smelling, tree bark and pine cones with some earth. There's also a nice citrus quality of bitter grapefruit zest and juicy pink grapefruit flesh.  T: Grapefruit zest and pink grapefruit flesh upfront, but leans more bitter and oily than juicy or sweet. Nice candy caramel and toffee notes without getting cloying, as well as some nice bread crust. The finish grows piney with a bitterness that contains to build and grow to consider levels after about ten seconds. Finishes fairly crisp and lightly dry, though.  F: Medium-plus with creamy carbonation, slick and oily with hop resins.  O: One of the OG IPAs of Americans, and still tastes amazing to this day. Highly recommended as a staple beer for all hopheads.","  rDev 12oz bottled 7-9-18 1  white dense head with amazing retention. Orange/Amber glowing IPA with a slight chill haze. Thick lacing. Oranges and pine...smells like a classic. Sweet malt is also present and fighting it out.

Delicious, Sierra Nevada just gets better and better. Outstanding.  12-26-21 Still outstanding.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle, from the Fall Pack. Bottled on '07/09/18 08:25'. Clear, medium amber, with some gold notes, colored body. Close to a two finger, white colored head, which slowly recedes. Leaves behind sheets of lacing.  Expressive aroma of citrus and pine hops, with some caramel malts (more in the background). Taste is redolent with hops (orange citrus, piney resin, and lighter floral). Certainly a caramel malt component. Bitterness is there but not overboard. Balanced by a slightly sweet aspect. Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation.  A beer that begs each sip to linger in the mouth in order to experience the full spectrum of aroma and flavor. Years ago, before the explosion of craft beer choices, this beer was in my regular rotation. Coming back to this beer again emphasizes the craft expertise of this brewer. Once in a while it is a good choice to delve into beers once enjoyed, but usually passed over because of the multitude of choices in the new environment of local, newer local breweries.","  rDev Bought in London, England. From either Waitrose or Whole-Foods 355ml bottle, BB 26-01-19 L Pale chestnut, 1/2cm very pale tan head, slight haze. Gentle rising carbonation S Distinct citrus nose. Fresh, pleasant. T Wow, right into deep rich hops. There is a crispness [despite serious 7.2% ABV] from a citrus edge. M. They've managed to structure a heavy ABV beer into a very nicely balanced brew. Put another way; it's very easy drinking for a beer this strong. It remains refreshing and relatively 'clean tasting'. O This is very well constructed, great skill has clearly gone into it. For me, it's the kind of beer I'd start a night with, slowly sipping, before changing over to a more 'session' type beer later. Very nice, I'd happily buy and drink this again.","  rDev Tasty IPA from Sierra Nevada, can from Jackson’s in Boise. Dark golden with thin foamy head, pungent aroma of pine forest, taste is piney hops, small lingering palate and short, abrupt finish. Easy drinker, but very well put together.","  rDev L: Hazy amber color, one and a half finger beige head, amazing lacing, good carbonation.  S: Hops, malts.  T: Hoppy, malty, caramel, bitter. Nice!  F: Light bodied, extremely drinkable and refreshing.  O: Exceptional IPA.","  Pours a clear, deep amber coloration with a medium, foamy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, orange rind and a hint of pine. Taste follows the nose, with a nice balance of bready, caramel malt and somewhat flowery, citrus hops, with notes of orange rind and just a hint of pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness, some orange rind and a little more pine coming through in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  I really think it's a testament to Sierra Nevada how good this still tastes at almost 6 months old. I've always thought that SN brews hold up incredibly well and this is no exception, still retaining a good balance of bready, caramel malt and bitter, resinous, somewhat floral, citrus hops. Although I'm sure that this has a bit more of a bitter, resinous bite to it when fresh and it's perhaps just a tad more sweet and flowery than I would like, this is something that I would happily buy again even at this age if only I could get it at a decent price. Still tastes better than most German WCIPAs at half its age, to be honest. I have adjusted scores slightly upwards to make up for its age, although perhaps not enough. Would love to taste this fresh one day.","  rDev Looks great for an IPA, carbonation, good head and lacing. Not really strong in the smelling department but you get the hops. Not too strong for the hop flavor but a solid IPA. My buddy likes this beer and I had yet to try it. I'd never turn one down but there are other IPA's I'd rather have. This is an easy drinking beer and maybe an excellent palate cleanser. Overall I enjoyed the Torpedo but it wouldn't be on my favorites list for IPA's today. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle PKGD 12/30/2017.","  rDev Label says: PCKGD 11/14/16. Which means that someone sold me this IPA with almost one year old. Terrible idea. Poured into a BrewDog stemmed glass.  A: The body recalls a west coast IPA, having that orange-y, coppery tone with a crisp tone, absolutely no haziness. The head is white to beige, has a 1 finger thickness and besides having an average to low retention, there's some good lacing. S: The aroma is very creamy of citrus and also some belgian candy (very weird). Almost a bit biscuity. There's a minor hoppy aroma resembling some resin and if you concentrate, you can feel the alcohol. T: The taste begins with a citrus of orange and tangerine and also some pineapple like flavour. It then extends to the weird super sweet flavour that, for me, tastes like belgian candi but it's totally impossible to have this on such style. In the end, a mild hoppiness with a bland character. M: Body is medium. Carbonation is great. Alcohol is in fact unnoticed. Bitterness is mild but being packaged almost one year ago, who wouldn't expect that? O: It's a bad idea to have this without being fresh. However, there's a sense at how this beer can taste when it's fresh and I really want to try it again.","  rDev 12oz bottled 1/16/18 (29 days ago) poured into a Torpedo tulip pint glass at fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours bright light copper in color with dense off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is mixed with citrus, pine and caramel malt all showing up at times. The taste is resiny pine up front with semisweet caramel in the middle before sticky, piney bitterness finishes the sip. There is a hint of citrus in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, excellent. This beer helped define a style years ago. I still love WCIPA's, and still enjoy Torpedo a great deal.","  rDev I just had this IPA at a party serving otherwise crappy beer. I am glad I was able to get it.  Look: copper hue, decent head and lacing  Aroma: citrus and pine  Taste: The flavor is fruity and hoppy; grapefruit, orange, and pine resin. It is very well balanced and a very good basic IPA.  Feel: It is crisp and light yet tasty.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  PKGD 020317 M 13:43  Appearance: The body is mostly transparent with only a slight amount of haze. It has a nice caramel colored body with a thick, fluffy, rocky white head. Great retention and lacing.  Aroma: There isn't much aroma. I am getting some light herbal scents and it has a bit of a flowery aroma but they are very soft.  Taste: It is immediately noticeable how clean the beer is. The flavors come through very crisp and clear. Up front there is a light herbal pine flavor that flows through the mid-palate all the way to the end. It finishes with a nice woody and mossy flavor at the end.  Mouthfeel: It is a very clean and easy drinking beer. Great carbonation, great bitterness, and it is just an overall enjoyable beer to drink. It has a nice dry finish that accents the flavors.  Overall: It's a well made American IPA that you can just sit back and enjoy. I would recommend it and I would pick it up every now and then.","  rDev Just a great IPA and another hit from Sierra Nevada, everything they make is very good and priced well this is no exception. It's got a nice clean malt profile with a citrus and piney hop character and a clean finish. It's just a straight forward IPA. Not super complex, but it's just so good for what it is.","  rDev Had on tap, poured a dark Amber color, clear with a one inch white head that Hung around flow a while and left some lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pineapple, malts and caramel. Taste follows the nose with additional notes of mango, pepper and herbal notes.

It is one magnificent looking beer. Its color is light copper-amber with a bright display aspect. The modest head is just off-white, tight and enduring. The smell just about lives up to its looks. There's plenty mild sweetness provided by the malt. Then, there's a hoppiness that seems to be in perfect balance. Traces of yeast and alcohol complete the treat. The nose didn't mislead on this one. This is first noticed to be a wonderfully smooth brew. No doubt credit goes to the malting, which provides a great body without the expense of being too sweet. Now, it can be noticed how beautiful this laces the inside of the glass as it recedes. There's distinct demarcation for each time the glass was raised and consumed from. Neither West Coast-like, with their sharply often piney bite, nor New England-like, with their softened hopping, this is just a really good blend of hops to contrast the malt and confirm to the drinker that this is a full flavored APA.

On another note, guess I'll be reviewing again.","  rDev On tap at Cardinal’s big Brewers’ Night, Golden colour, moderate white head. Lovely aroma of tropical fruits and citrus. Lovely hops in the flavour too, but the malty base is a tad too sweet for my taste, with the typical American crystal malts / orange marmalade character. Still a fine beer, which I’d be happy to sample again.","  rDev I’ll preface this review with the fact that I believe that this beer does in fact firmly belong in the pale ale category. People calling it an IPA, please stop. It’s not.  A: Pours a bronze color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing  S: A good mix of citrus and fruitiness from the citra along with some caramel malt. Light floral notes present as well  T: Follows the nose. The citra comes out swinging with the citrus, floral, and fruity notes. Some pine in there as well. Moderate, firm bitterness. Caramel malt provides a nice backing sweetness that balances the bitterness nicely. Finishes with lingering citrus  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A great pale ale that is perfectly balanced and extremely easy to drink. Undoubtedly one of the best single-hop pale ales out there","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  Appearance: The body is a medium gold color with good clarity. The head is medium to medium-large and pure white. It has a mostly smooth surface with a few dips and bubbles scattered around. Lacing has nice broken cobwebs wherever the head recedes. It's a very good looking beer in the glass.  Aroma: It's interesting. A faint whiff of peach hits the nose right before It smells of cumin, cabbage, and onion. Letting it sit on the table for a bit seems to drive off most of those vegetable and spice aromas and it returns back to a strong peach scent. It's an odd beer. It keeps flip-flopping between peach and onion.  Taste: Up front there is a hop bine oil character which slowly transitions into peach on the center of the tongue. There is a bit of mango in the middle and it slowly starts to build up more mango as the beer finishes. The aftertaste is peach and mango with a grain flour character. The more this beer is consumed the more the mango and peach flavors start to layer on the palate. It starts to take on a bit of a peach tea flavor as well which is quite nice. Letting this one work a bit on the palate has been rewarding.  Mouthfeel: It has a nice dry finish on the tongue. Bitterness is equivalent to biting into the skin of a plum. Carbonation is good. It has an overall nice character.  Overall: The more the beer is consumed, the more the peach flavor starts to come out. This isn't a beer that is likely to show its true colors in a sampler or a taster, so I would not recommend anything short of a full glass when reviewing it. It's a really good Pale Ale but like an old mower it takes a bit for it to get started. I would really recommend being patient with this beer because, despite the name, it is a delicate bluebell flower that needs some sunlight to bloom. Give it some room to grow and you'll be rewarded. I would drink it again. I would recommend it to others, especially to those who enjoy something like a peach tea. The downside is the beer doesn't have a ton of aroma, but the flavor is really nice. This beer would pair nicely with some grilled pineapple and cherry skewered shrimp.","  rDev Zombie Dust 12 oz. can Served in a Brewery Ommegang Witte glass  Pours a hazy golden orange with a very nice fluffy head on top. Phenomenal trails of sticky lacings appear all over the sides of the glassware.  Whiffs of freshly sliced citrus and baking bread  This beer is the real deal, I felt obligated to review. It's super quaffable and smooth with a toasted biscuit malt backbone and a juicy citrus hop snap meets pine cone blast on the finish. It's complex in flavor and taste, yet straightforward (in a really good way).   The best beer I've had in quite some time, I'm impressed.   Cheers!","  rDev Pours murky, orange gold in color with one third inch head. Taste is big pale malt, unripe mango, and lemon lime. Medium body, slightly bitter with high carbonation. Makes for a really nice pale ale. Better as it warms. Good but doesn't live up to the hype. Different from the usual pale ale offerings.","  rDev Picked up a sixer before New Years that was one of the few things that we didn't get into that night. Been meaning to try this for a while. Impressive look, especially the lacing, and slick but delicious nose. Serious hop assault for a simple APA, with a withering bitterness and a finishing touch of honey and citrus. This is a longtime legend, and while expertly crafted and very tasty, I do feel it may be a little old fashioned for the 2021 palate.","  rDev Slightly opaque orange apricot colored with a half inch of tightly bubbled off white foam that settles out slowly to a fine cap. Bright aroma of tangerine and grapefruit rind. Initially hoppy and puckery on the cheeks, a mild honey malt rises up and quickly gets kicked back down by hop bitterness. Full mouthfeel, creamy but sparkly at the same time. Piney bitters linger. Good beer.","  rDev Look- Strong amber color with good clarity and a nice long-lasting head. Smell- Firm dank hit of hops and some caramelized malts underneath. Taste- It matches the aroma with a very solid blast of dank piney hop oil over lightly roasted/caramelized malts. Feel- Firm with uplifting carbonation. Overall- I was very excited to try this but in my opinion it is WAY over hyped. Still a very solid and enjoyable beer.","  rDev Very excited (and somewhat nervous, considering all of the hype it has in the annals of my memory from having heard nothing but praise for it for almost the entire decade of my enjoyment of craft beer... shit, has it really been that long? Yikes) for my first can of Zombie Dust. This one needs no introductions whatsoever for 99% or more of the craft beer community, particularly those who love hops, so let's jump right in.  The pour is a mostly-clear (well, compared to most New England pale ales, anyway) medium-orange color with a soapy and thick, dense head of bone-white foam that leaves behind some soapy lace as it slowly fades to a retentive ring of rocky suds measuring almost a finger-and-a-half even after ten or so minutes in my glass. Very nice looking, for sure. Visible carbonation activity rising from the bottom of my glass, as well. Good first impression!  So, I am aware this is a 100% Citra pale ale (though the style has been hotly debated for a while, as it's certainly in  IPA  strength and has matching IBUs to boot, but that's neither here nor there), and the nose definitely brings that to light. To me, this smells a bit more  dank  than some fruitier Citra beers I've had, with a lot of pine, grassiness, and resin upfront with some sticky papaya, melon, mango, and grapefruit in there as well. I also detect a slight spice and herbal undertone that feels pungent and intriguing, plus a hint of biscuity and bready malt. Seems pretty well-rounded. Of course, it doesn't seem overly intense to me, either, but I kinda expected that given the effect hype can have (plus it has wider distribution now, so who knows if the recipe is any different?).  Palate is clean and semi-malty with flashes of cantaloupe, tangerine, grapefruit, biscuit, and mango hanging around in there, all punctuated by moderating carbonation and a hint of bitterness and ethanol in the finish. Definite pine flavors and some light resinous dankness as well as a more  passion fruit -like note that lingers in the finish. Satisfying and quenching, yeah, but definitely not the best pale ale ever... glad to have given it a shot, and will buy more if I see it around, as it's definitely enjoyable and not expensive, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, in my opinion.","  rDev Canned 10/7/20  Oh my, look what we have here. Just a week after 3 Floyds started distributing to MA, we've ended up with this gem. The #1 American Pale Ale and #39 overall on this site. This should be a treat, I've been hearing about this one sinceI joined BA over 2 years ago  Pours a cloudy copper gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves plenty of lacing  I feel like the aroma here leans more towards IPA than APA, but what's the difference really? Notes of orange, resiny hops, fresh pine, papaya, and caramel malt stick out the most with subtle notes of peach and grain  Very fresh in taste, up front I get tons of soft tropical fruit like peach and mango with very gentle hopping. The swallow brings a quick flash of piney hops that fade to the background, allowing a smooth pale malt to shine through, each supporting one another in the aftertaste  So damn drinkable, crushable even. A light medium body works with gentle carbonation for a very smooth beer. A mostly dry finish, but still brings exciting juiciness  #39 overall? Nahh. But incredible nonetheless. Very fresh and exciting, and probably the best price point for a highly rated beer, at just $2.50 for a single. The lowish abv definitely works in its favor, I could session these all day (and I think I just might have to do that)","  rDev This beer has a slight chill haze and is dark amber with light amber highlights (SRM 7-11). A big, two-inch, almond head starts foaming and gradually settles to become a pancake pillow. Sticky lace abounds on a PBGC Pub Pint.  The aroma opens with sweet caramel that stands out against pine resin and light, tropical citrus.  The balance tends toward bitterness over sweetness. The flavors closely follow the nose. Pine resin is quite nice, while caramel and biscuit malt follow quickly. The flavor has a zesty quality of light citrus, while the finish is modest and lingering.  Alcohol is as expected, with no astringency or abrasiveness. The beer has a medium body with modest carbonation and the texture of fine wool.  This beer was canned almost four weeks prior to my purchase and review. I suspect the hop profile has been diminished. It is, however, on tap locally and I just might grab a crowler for comparison. Regardless, this IPA was just right for an overcast, breezy late summer afternoon.","  rDev A: Creamy, billowy tan head at three inches appears soft and cushy. Dark orange pour with a vibrant amount of carbonation. Head retention is good, the lacing is thick and sticky on the vessel walls. Very nice presentation, lace visual.   S: Fresh breakfast juice, green melon, cantaloupe and juicy peaches. Small watermelon grind, passion fruit and lemon peel. Soft citrusy pale grains.   T: Crisp flavor, pale malts provide a great backdrop to the orange-citrusy and mango-pineapple flair of hops. Soft flowery pine citrus, citronella, and a appreciable dry hopping, bready malts.   M: Mouthful was crisp, light dry with a flowery coating on the tongue.   O: Overall honestly this is a go to pale ale, and I'm sure back in the day it paved the way for the many great examples we have now but...I really wasn't wow'd after the years of build up and anticipation, and after the many newer whirlpool N.E. examples i have experience. With a rotating market of hazy juicy ipa's and pales flooding the market this is a great classic example for me, but hardly see a reason for repeat purchase with so many other great options at my finger tips. This has a great drinkability rate and as a pale and rating to style I did give it a bump of .25 overall. With all consideration this is a outstanding beer but hardly see what all the fuss is about, and a 100 seems a bit far fetched. 91 for me.","  rDev -clear amber can pour with a thin , white foam cap and citrus aroma ( lemon and a bit of lime).  The flavor is an even balance of malt and hop flavors. Some orange and grapefruit zest show most prominently. The hop bitterness is moderate.  The finish is clean. I am thankful for the opportunity to try this brew.","  rDev Finally, the #1 in my favorite #1 style _ APA _ arrives reasonably priced in cans at WFM.  a) A for appearance with a non-stop white blanketing head over a hazed copper apricot body. s) Floral, like you just came in from the garden, woody, stemmy, citrus blossoms more than flesh. t) Found taste bigger than aroma, ripe, juicy, round flavors of citrus, blossoms, flower store, brought home with a pungent, piney, hoppy, peppery finale that battles juicy sweet fruit vs cleansing pepper and pine.  f) Semi-sweet smooth bitterness sprouting a crisp dry finish. o) Wins over the competition, bright and memorable, will return for many more 6's now that it's available in WFM.","  rDev Born on 8/19/20, consumed on 9/10/20. 3 Floyds has finally made it to upstate NY. . . .  A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is mostly clear coppery-amber-golden with a 2-finger foamy head on top, which recedes to leave behind splotches of lace.  S: Light caramel malt foundation is followed by modest hops - some citrus and some earthy hops. Not a really strong nose at all, but a pleasant one.  T: Husky grain, crackery malt and a sweeter caramel malt foundation is followed by clean hops - a touch of citrus, but more of an earthy, herbal profile overall. Finishes with a hint of lemon.  M: Light-to-medium in heft, with soft &amp; fine carbonation. A good feel for a traditional APA.   O: This beer will not blow you away with in-your-face hops or some other dramatic flavor profile, but it is a well done, clean APA that's tremendously easy to drink. A nice curveball from the usual NEIPAs I've been drinking lately - a throwback of sorts.","  rDev Zombie Dusk pours a darker amber color, with a long lasting head. Rich aroma, noticeable floral hop notes. Flavor is full, floral hops, with a good solid rich malt base. Good body and feel. Overall, a bitter pale ale, with lots of floral flavors.","  rDev Poured from a 12oz can into a pub glass.   Look is a hazy brown orange with a full white head.   Aroma is a great balance of malt and hops.   Taste matches aroma, clear malt backbone with herbal hops.","  rDev Pours a semi clear amber with soft, soapy head.  Smell is fruity and slightly sweet with notes of pine, grapefruit, apricot, caramel and a floral hint.  Taste is fruity with a shot of caramel and spongecake with huge notes of pine, grapefruit and oranges. Moderate, floral bitterness, very clean with plenty of punch, and great balance.  Mouthfeel is medium,s ticky and well carbonated.  Overall, an outstanding pale ale/IPA. A legend for a reason.","  rDev Canned on 7/21/20; consumed on 8/11/20  Pours a translucent, glossy burnt copper-orange body topped with over two fingers of thick, semi-creamy off-white foam; good head retention yields a finger of frothy cap, a creamy, moderate collar climbing upward, and chunky strands of webby lacing ringing around the walls of the glass.  Aroma opens with grapefruit rinds and caramel malts prominent upfront before steadily embracing soft, woody tones toward a middle of pine, fresh grass, and floral mango; back end features a more robust, toastier caramel lightening to a healthy dose lightening as the bouquet closes.  Taste brings clean caramel malt accented with orange zest and pine to preface a prominently grapefruit-driven mid-palate; woody textures evolve into the back end as hints of lavender and crackery malt and harmonize on the finish and linger; an exceptionally clean all-around profile.  Mouthfeel has a light-medium body accompanied by a full, fluffy carbonation, dispersing over the palate quickly to an oily, slightly resinous mid-palate; a soft, hoppy grit proceeds into the back end as a staunch bitterness is concealed beneath a continually slick overtone to what becomes a dry finish.  A classic profile sporting its own exceptional nuance, and aiding in establishing this pale ale as a near-universally agreeable example of the style; a soft, fruity, and floral complexity embraces the blunt, old-school vibe of caramel malt and pine for a brew at its sessionable peak and worthy of merit.","  rDev Review #1438  This beer was on my top 10 must-try. I live in the best place for beauty, but a baron desert for many beers. I was lucky enough to get this beer through a BIF, thank you, Montana! The beer is 44 degrees and poured into a pint glass. The beer produced a creamy, fluffy, and airy head. The retention of the head is excellent. Off-white lacing formed after the head dissipated. The beer's color is SRM 4, pale gold, with amber hues. No haziness in this beer.   The beer is just over two and a half months old. The initial aromas I smell are pine, biscuit, toasted bread crust. Nosing further into the glass, I detect lemons, grapefruit, floral, herbal, a hint of phenols, a subtle honey-like sweetness, a bit of earthiness, and oranges.   The flavors in the beer are biscuit, bready, lightly toasted malts, phenols, floral, oranges, resin, pineapple, mangos, grapefruit, herbal, botanical, and malty sweetness.   The mouthfeel of the beer is dry, tannic, and slick.   The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and fuller finish.   This beer is tasty. I only have one of these I could crush a six-pack. The pale ale aspect of the beer is good, yet I wanted more hops. The malty backbone of the beer is sturdy and could handle a heftier hop profile. Alas, it would change the final product, I would not want that. Excellent beer, a must-try for any beer lover.","  rDev De Mikkeller webshop. En copa Teku.

Canned 7/25, so pretty damn fresh.  The body has a wonderful creaminess to it. Lots of robust citrus zest dominates with a pine-y bitterness at the end. The malt backbone is firm and caramel-y.   This is an outstanding citra showcase, almost as good as Psuedo Sue. I don't recall the price, but I think this is pretty damn reasonable.

I know I have drunk several enjoy by, sometimes not by the date on the can. I saw this at my local purveyor and purchased it. This beer says enjoy by 4/20, I wonder if it has some other connotation. I wonder if this beer will have dank characters. This my second Stone beer within the last week. Time for the review.   The beer is 44 degrees and served in a pint glass. When I opened up the can, an immense dank aroma emitted. The head created in the glass from the pour is a two-fingers thick. The color of the beer is bright white. The foam of the beer is creamy and airy. The retention of beer is excellent. The head left some lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale yellow with amber hues.  The initial aromas in the beer are dank, musty, pine, and grapefruit. Nosing deeper I smell toasted crackers, bread, oranges, lemons, floral esters, bay leaves, earthiness, a subtle honey note, and a touch of pine.   The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, mandarin oranges, orange peel, lemons, pine, bay leaves, earthiness, honey, dankness, musty, bready, toasted malts, floral esters, and resin. I was surprised by the strong alcohol content.   The mouthfeel of the beer is creamy and astringent.   The body of the beer is medium, medium-low, and medium-plus finish.   This beer has a lot of dank, similar to the green herb. The beer has a bright hop profile. The hops in the beer are harmonious. The malt is firm and holds up well. The beer does have a malty sweetness from the malts. This beer is packing a wallop with a high ABV. I thought that the malts were sweet, thus an indication of alcohol. It was a run of the mill type IPA, nothing special. The beer is about average.","  rDev Drinking this at home on 4/20/2020 Happy Holiday! Poured from a can with a date of packaged on 3/24/20, fresh! Appears clear amber with a nice foamy head that lasted. Smells piney, citrusy, grapefruit. Taste follows the nose. Definitely hop forward. This is a double IPA and not really boozy at all. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall, I would definitely drink this tasty hop bomb again, and you should too, before it all goes up in smoke....","  rDev Stone Enjoy By 01.01.20. Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) can into a custom taster pint; packaged 11/20/19. A: Pours a hazy, golden-amber color with a one to two finger, lemon chiffon head, solid cap retention, and sticky rings of lacing. S: Aromas of caramel, pineapple, pine, and honey. T: Sweet. Flavors follow the nose, although sweetness seems more derived from cane than honey. Solid, spicy bitterness. M: Medium bodied with solid persistence of effervescence. O: First time I have had this and really impressed. Top notch AIPA.","  rDev The 01/01/20 version.  Poured from a can into a tulip.  Pours a nearly crystal clear medium gold with limited head but excellent lacing.   A variety of solid and nuanced hop aromas greet the nose. Bitter citrus notes (white grapefruit mostly), pine resin, dank/weedy aromas, and touches of floral and chivy notes.  This version of Enjoy By has a pretty strong malt backbone that presents with caramel malt sweetness. The midstream is a melange of citrus peel (orange), citrus flesh (white grapefruit), white pepper, pine resin, lavender/soapy floral flavor, and hints of tropical sweetness. The finish is classic dank and weedy west-coast with some booze. Well balanced on the whole, although it seems somewhat subdued.  The brew is at least medium-bodied, but has some nice carbonation and dryness at the finish.  This is the first of the  Enjoy By  series that I've reviewed. This one is the most subdued on the aroma and the flavor that I've had, but it is also very well-balanced, and has a well-melded array of malt flavors.","  rDev Enjoy by 1-1-20 32oz growler poured 12-12-19, opened 12-13-19. 1/2  white head on a clear, clean copper-ish golden IIPA. Decent retention on the head until it falls to a sparse cap. Sticky, spotty lacing. Floral is the first aroma to hit me, getting some wild onion as well. I would say dank is appropriate. Candied orange and pine. Big malt base holding it all up. Piney and floral...bitter citrus rind/peels. Sweet malt but never overly so, enough to hold it all together...balance seems good to me for such a big beer. Bright entry, medium body and carbonation.

Light weediness. Subtle citrus. Medium to full body. Slick mouthfeel. High and clean bitterness. Big beer at 9.4%, a single was the right call for me. All 4's on this one.  Very Good.","  rDev On tap at Ron’s Corner Tavern Enjoy by 01-01-20. Typical color, abundant carbonation and little head. The pleasant hop aroma is light but refreshing. Excellent taste a nice blend of hops and bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and very tasty. Overall an outstanding IPA.","  rDev From can to glass. 14 days since canned.  Dark gold. Mostly clear.  Smells of pine sap and resins. Little sweetness.  Taste is same but with a malty silky body. Heavy bitter aftertaste. Finishing with heavy booze and bitterness.  Overall ok. Didn’t hide high abv well. More bitter flavor than any pleasant hop flavors.  Would not drink on a regular basis.","  rDev Pours clear, like well shined brass, with a small-to-medium head that leaves plenty of lace. Nose is not big at all for what I thought this beer would be. Certainly some malt syrup and a little dank citrus, but certainly could have been bigger. Taste is more like what I expected with both the heavy hops and malt coming through. Earthy, bitter citrus, and heavy graham cracker. Very good beer, but I expected more.","  rDev Bottled 11/19/15; drank 12/5/15 @ the Yarchives.   See-through urine appearance.   A rough pour yielded a big off-white head; a curtain of lace.   Pine, mango &amp; honey notes in the nose.   Medium thin mouthfeel.   Honey &amp; sweet mango flavors up front; faint pine notes on the finish.   Sweet, almost to the point of being cloying; this is normally my profile but was even too much for me.","  rDev Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap.","  rDev Enjoy by 10.31.18 -   22 oz. bottle:  Pours amber to copper with a creamy lasting white head. Lacing sticks.  The smell is robust - pine and grapefruit - some alcohol.  The taste is of pine/resin with grapefruit. A sweet touch with spicy alcohol comes through. Rounded bitterness in the finish. Alcohol shows but doesn't overwhelm.  It has a rich, full body with a silky smoothness despite alcohol bite.  Another winner from Stone! A big DIPA - big on hops and malt that interplay with each other well. Nice!","  rDev I really enjoyed  Enjoy by 10.31.18  from Stone, ABV 9.40%, IBU 90. I liked it better than the unfiltered Enjoy By, which had a garlic undertone (this one doesn't).

This doesn't come close to M-43, Crusher or Sip in my opinion. If I see it in Total Wine in Orlando this weekend I'll get another 6-pak. Would like to find it on draft.","  rDev For Enjoy by 04.20.18 What I like an IIPA to look like! Clear gold with volumnous white head, great retention and lacing. Not as dank as I thought it would be given the date, but its there. Lots of mango and tangerine, though. More dank in the flavor, lots more mango, not as much citrus. Bit of malt sweetness, and a clean, bitter finish. A little stickier than I like, but not cloying. There's a reason some breweries are so successful even when they're not chasing trends.","  rDev 12 oz bottle that was bottled on 9/24/17 and opened on 11/2/17 poured into a Duvel chalice.  Only a very slight haze happens upon an otherwise bright gold and amber color. A white, rocky topped foam has given decent coverage.   The aromatic density for this IPA is pretty stunning. Deep layers of several different hop effects pop out of the glass, earthy grapefruit, citrus blend, sweet and earthy.... The malt seems pretty hefty with some big honey and caramel aroma's . A hot/dry forest floor aroma is prevalent, dried leaves and maybe some golden wheat as well. There's a lot going on here.  The hop complexity becomes very clear with the first sip, whamo!! A hearty, crisp and earthy hop bite is impressive. Certainly a fresh, crisp and snappy overall feel and body. The sweet malty aroma really becomes much more crisp, light and bright in the flavor. A slightly bitter, metallic herbs and holden grains seem to seemlessly flow around eachother. Big earthy complexity, grainy, dry, citric and leafy come to mind from this combo of hops. The bitterness never gets too much, its in check but still delivers a bite. The 9.4 % abv. Is very well hidden and only adds to the depth and provides a nice warming effect. Earthy and dry citrus is the short version of this hop flavor, which is monsterously complex.  Stone still knows how to deliver the goods. Freeeesh.  Enjoy By 4/20/19!! * Update 12 oz. Can Just a bit late!...4/26/19  Copper gold, only a slight haze. Sticky white foam.  The 10 (10!!) Different hops give off a very stoney aroma. Dense and sweet citrus based tropical hoppy aromatics are deeeep. A caramel and honey tinged amber malt makes for that classic West Coast style balance.  Crisp bite, turns to a slick medium bodied feel, a bit boozy at 9.4 % abv which gets ramped up from the dry hitter side of the hops. With complexity comes a compromise in drinkablity sometimes, especially for the heady Western IPA's.","  rDev 12oz draft pour into a snifterloudy boasts a clear, mirror bright, orange-gold body and floats a persistent 1/4in cap of tightly bubbled head. Constant rising bubbles and a spotted lacing.  Aroma is mostly piney, grapefruit pith with a hint of spicy hops.  Flavor is dank, citrus grapefruit and a head-hitting sense, not flavor so much, just an understanding, of alcohol. The flavor of citrus hits the tongue first, thins to clear liquid, then explodes into  what did I just do?  dank alcohol.  Mouthfeel is both full and thin at the same time. At first the flavor fills the mouth and nose, intimidating the tongue, which, protecting itself, backs off while the feel thins, before the the back of the mouth and tongue remind you this is more than your regular IPA. Imperial, in fact.  Overall it is a very complex beer and I appreciate Stone's ability to produce it at such high volume.","  rDev Nice golden amber color with a thick white head on top. Has an overpowering hop smell with citrus accompanying it. Taste has citrusy hops with a malty finish.","  rDev 12oz bottled 9/24/17 poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 9.4% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey in color with a hint of orange. The head is off white, sticky and persistent. Lacing is prevalent. The aroma is pine, citrus and light honey. The taste is semisweet caramel, pine and citrus in classic west coast style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and bitter &amp; dry in the finish. Overall, still outstanding. This EB 10/31/17 is the first I've tried in years. The last few times I had it (2015), I was overwhelmed with onion aroma that I could not get over. This is back on point.","  rDev One of my favorite Enjoy Bys. Diverse hop profiles.  Poured a light golden color in a Spiegelau glass with a 4 finger head. Excellent head retention. The head lasts few minutes.  Wonderfully floral bouquet. Spice.  Very carbonated, spicy.  Grape, citrus taste. Before warming, the taste is dominated by hoppy spiciness. Grape and citrus, and a smoother MF come into play with warming. Spicy hoppy finish.  Overall, an excellent excellent+ beer.","  rDev Taste: complex flowery hops, dank and dry finish.

Oh boy is this one tasty brew. usually dank doesn't do much for me, but this balance is devastatingly spot on. 37 days to the day after being bottled. the mix of hops hits this palate perfectly.   close to full on the mouth, slightly bitter and sour on the finish.   overall, this is one of the most dangerously drinkable 9.4's you will find. Since Stone orders me to  Enjoy by 4/20/17 , I guess I'll have to drink the other one in the fridge tonight. poor me. :)","  rDev It is just after Midnight on 04.20.17 &amp; I just happen to have a bottle to be Enjoy[ed] By today! I am a little surprised that I have never reviewed this beer before now, but no time like the present, Happy 4-20 Day!  From the bottle:  Devastatingly Dank ;  Enjoy Now! ;  Brewed to be Enjoyed within 37 days ;  Live for the Now, the present. ;  You have in your hands a devastatingly fresh double IPA. While freshness is a key component of many beers - especially big, citrusy, floral IPAs - we've taken it further, a lot further, in this IPA. You see, we specifically brewed it NOT to last. We've not only gone to extensive lengths to ensure that you're getting this beer in your hands within an extraordinarily short window, we made sure that the Enjoy By date isn't randomly etched in tiny text somewhere on the label, to be overlooked by all but the most attentive of retailers and consumers. Instead, we've sent a clear message with the name of the beer itself that there is no better time than right now to enjoy this IPA! ;  Our all-important, hop-driven quest to deliver the most devastatingly fresh IPA on the planet facilitated a paradigm shift in 2012 with the launch of Stone Enjoy By IPA. Not only did we brew this beer with more than 10 different hops, we brewed it specifically NOT to last. Acclaimed for its groundbreakingly short shelf life, this intense double IPA brought forth a whole new concept of what constitutes 'fresh' - guaranteeing fans the ultimate level of hoppiness. This devastatingly dank stash of our dry-hopped, hop-bursted double IPA won't last long. Get your hands on this dank, golden beauty before everyone else gets wind of it. ;  There is no better time than right now to enjoy this beer.   I Pop!ped the cap &amp; debated as to an aggro pour or a gentle one. I went with the latter, followed by a vigorous in-glass swirl. This raised just under three fingers of dense, rocky, foamy, tawny head with good retention. Color was solid Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a bag of sticky, resinous dank had been dumped into my glass by way of the bottle! I rarely indulge as I have gotten older, especially while job hunting, but I can easily recognize the smell. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste had a unique bitterness, ranging from tropical fruit to bitter citrus fruit to resinous pine with a bit of cattiness thrown in for good measure! Whoa. I wonder why my hophead self never bothered to review this before, Finish was dry, hoppy &amp; a good way to kick off 4-20 Day.  Praise be to Greg Koch &amp; the rest of the Stoners! I have long been in Greg's ear about all sorts of wackiness, but at least their beers in CANs has come to fruition.   Yo, I'm about to drop the mic on some Enjoy By 07.04.17 in a CAN, yo!

Acclaimed for its groundbreakingly short shelf life, this intense double IPA brought forth a whole new concept of what constitutes 'fresh' - guaranteeing fans the ultimate level of hoppiness. This defiantly independent batch you have in your hands is no different. It, like its predecessors before, is a celebration and declaration of the fresh beer revolution. ;  There is no better time than right now to enjoy this beer.   CANducting a Crack! &amp; inverted Glug is just like riding a bike - once you learn, you never forget how to do it. I was doubly heartened by the fact that this one was marked as being  Unfiltered . No need to be gentle when the lees, particulate &amp; flocculate are supposed to be in suspension. Two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, foamy, tawny head with moderate retention &amp; I was there. Color was a deeply-hazy (but NOT cloudy) Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7). Nose smelled of ... pineapple?!? Wow. Actually, pineapple &amp; ruby red grapefruit, which is just a little sweeter than standard grapefruit. Mmmph! I think that I just creamed my jeans. Mouthfeel was medium, light for the style. The taste was actually surprisingly sweet with pineapple being the primary &amp; underlain by the semi-sweet grapefruit. 8=O Finish was only semi-dry, making it all that much more drinkable. This could be dangerous.","  rDev Big, juicy, &amp; citrusy hop bomb with a malt center and a piney finish. Very dank flavors that attack your tongue. The taste perfectly mimics the nose. Lots of fruit, but perfect proportion to the hop presence.","  rDev Pours a pellucid, reddish orange with an off-white froth. Wait, you mean it's not hazy!  Redolent with orange, citrus and pine.   Heavy on the hops up front of course, but plenty of fruit juice, caramel and spice to balance. And if that weren't enough, there's an encore wave of honey-like bitterness to finish.   Goes down medium and smooth, but you will not forget it's weight.   A complex and timeless DIPA for old school hop heads.","  rDev Not sure why this particular date gets its own entry. I wonder why that is...   Nice head, great clarity, and an outstanding nose. Citrus and strawberry and dank.   Huge taste. A big, juicy, citrus hop bomb with a malt center and a piney finish and aftertaste. A lot is going on here. This is delicious and is eminently drinkable at nine point four."]},{"Name":"Arrogant Bastard Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/43153/92/","Brewery":"Arrogant Consortia","Style":"Strong Ale - American","Alcohol":7.20,"Score":92.0,"Comments":["  rDev Into a clear glass Imperial pint mug it goes, the contents of a pint can. The process is almost like pouring Coca-Cola. With a dark caramel color and a light biege head that forms quickly. The significant difference is that the head endures. Far from being arrogant, the aroma is subdued, probably a little malty and even less hoppy. Boy, does the taste make up for what the nose doesn't get. Initially malty sweet, with some earthiness, much like black strap molasses, but not as sweet. Then, midstream, biting bitter hops overwhelm the taste buds the way an excellent West Coast IPA would. Probably earthy as contrasted with the resinous and/or piney WCIPAs, the finish is just as bitterly dry and lingering. This has been around for quite some time for good reason.","  rDev 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.2%. Dark brown to ruby colour, big to moderate light tan head. Nice but surprisingly moderate aroma of floral and fruity hops.  Arrogance  shows its face in the flavour, with a distinct and aggressive hoppy bitterness from start to finish. There is a certain malty sweetness in the background, but I cannot say the Arrogant Bastard belongs in the  well balanced  category. It is probably not meant to belong there. Perhaps I am  not worthy  after all? My wife said she liked it, though. Spooky ...","  rDev 12 yrs or so since I last had this.  Now comes in a tall boy for $3.49. About 2 months old.  Very dark clear amber, tan creamy head.  Smells like spicy grassy hops. Maybe not super fresh. Malt-woodsy.  Tastes like a hoppy amber. Kind of resiny rye-ish.  Medium.  Overall: doesn’t stand out anymore. I honestly have no idea if the recipe is changed but it does taste like a macro version of a microbrew.","  rDev 2020-08-21 16oz can served in a can-shaped Flat Stick Pub glass. Canned 06/03/20, Enjoy By 10/01/20. Kudos to the  Arrogant Consortia  for including both. It somewhat mortifies me that I've never reviewed this beer. This was once a go-to for me.  Anyway, pours a rich caramel color, fairly clear, with a big head that fades fairly slowly and a healthy amount of carbonation to support it. Smell is vaguely hoppy, a little toffee, some pine sniffing straight from the can. Overall, fairly muted.  Taste is slight toffee sweetness just for a bit before a burnt caramel and slight dark roast coffee wave bowls me over. Bitterness builds up in west-coast IPA style. Coats the mouth in bitterness, with that toffee and burnt caramel drifting around the palate keeping things interesting.  Mouthfeel is medium or a little thicker. Overall, this beer is a classic. It's even better than I remember thinking it was.","  rDev Arrogant Consortia Arrogant Bastard Ale, 7.2% ABV. Pours deep red with a four-middle-finger beige head that left lots of foamy lacing. Nose is malt and toast. Taste is a hint of sweetness, before it's beat to a pulp by extremely bitter hops. Excellent dry mouthfeel, overall excellent. Not a fan of extreme bitterness, but can't deduct for that because I knew going in that's how an arrogant bastard rolls.","  rDev Drinking this from the tall can poured into a pint glass. Smells bready, piney, citrus. Taste malt forward, hoppy, creamy smooth. Mouth feel is creamy, malty. Overall a solid beer that I would definitely order again","  rDev Canned 10/3/19, enjoy 1/31/20  Pours an orangey-amber with 2 fingers of fluffy tan head  Aroma is akin to a classic west coast ipa, bold and citrusy hop notes with malt to match it  Wow, much more complex taste than the nose would suggest. The malt jumps out at me first, spicy and earthy, with the hops here being more bitter than anything. A nice toasted finish to the malt  Feels a little heavier than I was expecting, the carbonation is good but the body almost weighs it down  Overall something interesting, my experience went downhill from the pour to the finish, but it still kept me intrigued. I might get it again, who knows","  rDev Look: It pours deep amber with reddish hues and a full tan head. Head retention is excellent.   Smell: It has a rich caramel aroma with some dried cherries and a bit of spice.   Taste: It has caramel flavors and is quite hoppy with floral and spice. There are some dark cherry flavors in the background and pipe tobacco elements.   Feel: It has a medium full body and a pleasant bitter finish to it.   Overall, a great combination of malt and hops. For me it just hits the various elements right.","  rDev canned 7.10.19, opened 9.5.19  poured into a tulip, two finger big bubbled thick taupe foam cap over a ruby brown liquid, good solid retention, great lacings  aroma is spicy, grapefruit, pine,   bitter grapefruit taste, pine hops,   powerful, in yo FACE big bitter bite, slathers across the tongue , astringent   “if you dont like this beer, keep it to yourself— we dont want to hear from any sniveling yellow beer drinking wimps, ‘ cause this beer wasn’t made for you.”","  rDev (16 oz can, EJBY 10/24/19  L: polished-clear, deep garnet-colored liquid; solid, slow to crumble, slightly sepia/off-white foam - looks like a low-lying moon, with its craggy contours... foam pulls back to a thin collar, but laces crusty at the top  S: a red IPA (or imperial red); piney, earthy hops with a grapefruit undertone... sweetish, brown bread crust note soon emerges... vaguely doughy, vaguely (phenolic) spicy; no overt booze, though the piney hops color it medicinal... good intensity overall, especially the citrus-menthol hop/booze combo  T: layers of hops - almost oniony, aggressively-bitter grapefruit charge shoots to the fore, while the background is awash in citrusy hop resins and near fruit-cakey, mid-dark crusty, caramelly malts... everything brash and bold, but balanced in its own way... perfumy, sort of Earl Grey tea aftertaste, peppery as well... halfway through, and this basically tastes like an ultra-bitter, slightly less boozy West-Coast barleywine  F: frothy, resinous, plush-satiny flow... its bitter bite smacks the tongue with a lasting sting - that with the creeping ethanol heat keeps the palate humming... sipper-ific; lip-smacking  O: I may have first tried this circa '01-02... for the longest time, I never liked this, notably the pungent green-onion hop character, which I also found in some of their other beers, but maybe more so I cringed at the goofy b.s. on the(ir) label(s) - turned me off to them for awhile, but I did eventually enjoy some of their brands, such as Ruination and Enjoy By; softened my stance a bit... I hesitate to admit it, but I'm glad this is still around - not too many American beers these days maintain this level of intense bitterness and rich red maltiness (outside of said barleywines with the latter)... loud, lummox-y, and obnoxious, lacking subtle complexities, but ultimately undeniably enjoyable... throwback American craft at its finest - has its place (1475)","  rDev Finally got to try this brew, and it was actually well worth it...  Got this from a can and what struck me were two things: First, how beautifully reddish-dark or copperish color it poured, foamy head and good lacing - it was truly a site to behold. The smell was malty but nothing else I could really pull out and it was well carbonated but not so that it was distracting. The second thing that struck me was how much this reminded me of a Boston Lager - though with more flavor and bitterness to boot. At first I didn't know what to do with it, but the more I sipped the more I wanted to guzzle.   Great beer, another one of those that actually lives up the hype...","  rDev Wow these are way more a boozy punch in the tongue and even roof of mouth than nearly all other brews of this ABV, and this is also why I prefer this one to its double counterpart.","  rDev This one treats you right (even when you’ve done wrong). It’s all kinds of hella wild and nasty fresh out of the gate. It looks maddening; just deep dark ruby and brownish like your great aunt’s hair (you know, the one who didn’t hesitate to beat you because you stole a bite from supper before prayer). On top of that is wild and rich caramel scents like eating a Milky Way on the moon. Then, as this player took a sip, he was rewarded like Ronaldo during a free kick - I’m talking goalllllllll!   Sip it while you can, cuz the gettin’ gets good!","  rDev Poured from a fresh tall call into the test glass A - Mahogany backdrop with excellent clarity. Carbonation is steady, A solid pour creates a pillowy off white cap. S - Burnt sugar, earthy grains, none of that sweet stuff here. T - Dark toast, earthy hops a bit of light brown sugar.  M - Medium to hefty on he palate, with a sweet start that quickly morphs toward the bitter side. Finish is slick and forever O - A fine offering, with not as big a bite as I expected. Water is surprisingly soft, and that helps","  rDev Pours a copper/brown with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. Strong hoppy aroma. Flavors of coffee, caramel and chocolate and a strong alcohol component. Good mouth feel.","  rDev Canned 12/10/18  Pours a dingy, deep, clear brown with ruby hues and topped with a thicker head of off-white froth; nice retention here, and the glass is left caked with soapy lacing and a steady collar on the surface.  Aromas of dense, earthy hops accompanied by tons of pine with a firm, sappy caramel malt backbone; dark bread crusts and heavily toasted tones linger all around, almost to the point of giving dried wood impressions; building in intensity without becoming especially overwhelming, you can tell the bouquet here is a sign of things to come.  Taste shows bready, heavily toasted caramel malts (resembling an imperial red ale almost) nearly overwhelmed with a firm hop punch and tons of prickly, herbal/earthy pine tones; fairly one-dimensional, but the hops burst to a level of expressiveness against the malt backbone that add depth to the upfront simplicity of the profile.  Mouthfeel battles between a sticky malt and the massive, drying hop presence that ultimately overwhelms it; robust, prickly, sticky body with a present but tempered medium carbonation; unabashedly aggressive, a palate wrecker really, but there’s an unexpected (and unusual) drinkability coming through.  This can be one-dimensional, but it does one-dimensional pretty well; the hops are aggressive and expressive, and the malt profile is comforting in its place in the background while rearing its head as a balancing foil to the hop aggression. A unique kind of strong ale, and one I’m finding very drinkable in spite of its intensity.","  rDev Reviewed as part of BJCP training, 22B American strong ale. Enjoy by 4/09/19  Pours a huge frothy tan dense head with great retention and lacing, clear but dark ruby copper color  Nose brings hops out front, citrus, pine, then malts, toasted reddish malts, plenty of caramel and toasted bread crusts, almost coffee like roast  Taste big sweet like malts, rich reddish toasty malts, toasted bread crust, plenty of caramel and a little toffee, hint of malt derived fruit, big hops, very bitter to balance the big sweet malt, hops again bringing citrus, pine, and spicy flavors, a touch of warming alcohol, drier medium full attention, huge bitter spicy piney hops, touch more alcohol  Mouth is fuller bodied, just a touch of warming but smooth alcohol, astringency gets a little high but not too much, fairly high carbonation  Overall def within style although less of the new world hops but that's more likely because this beer came out long before there were many new world hops and essentially defined the style. It's in its own world of beers, enjoyable but almost undrinkable","  rDev Popped the cap on a bomber of this one while relaxing in my hotel room. I can see where some may really enjoy this one, but I can't get the appeal. There's lots of malt, and a certain aggressiveness. But rather than a hop aggressiveness it tastes rand feels more like a rake across the tongue. I assume this is what they're going for, but it's not for me.","  rDev ** 07/26/2018  I know I've had this many times before when it was still Stone; but 'ticking' and rating it here to make it official. I never liked this beer all that much or the tagline of  you're not worthy  or the arrogance of the description. I know, it's supposed to be Arrogant b/c of the name, but it still rubs me the wrong way, Yes, it's got a good amount of bitterness and it's in your face and it doesn't try to smooth that out in any way, but something about the approach turns me off.   That being said, I learned to like Stone much more sometime after this when their IRS and regular IPA and things like Xocoveza became available near me. Also, given some time to cool off from being deemed  Not Worthy , I can look at it with some perspective.  Can to Snifter. (4/11/18) LOOK: dark amber. medium beige head with excellent retention. AROMA: biscuit and vegetable; leaves, hay.  TASTE: more biscuity/crackery malt upfront; wood and sap in the finish. FEEL: medium body; excellent carbonation.  Still not a favorite of mine, but I'll give it props for some of the perepherials as it is well crafted. It is not for the light hearted.   **","  rDev Poured from a 473ml can. Canned on 16/02/2018 enjoy by 16/02/2019. over 10k in ratings not much i can add . A strong hoppy ale for sure great flavor with a kick.","  rDev I thought I did this one already... turns out it was the Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard, easy mistake to make as in my memory the labels looked EXACTLY THE SAME [actually there is a slight difference in them]. So here we are Arrogant Bastard! What? No I wasn’t insulting you, that’s the name of the beer... jeez, Arrogant Bastards. That was insulting you, see the difference? No, well maybe I was insulting you then. As far as American Strong Ales go this is the most popular on a little site I go to called Beer Advocate - 10,712 ratings so for, here comes #10,713! Will it be as great as Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard? Only minutes will tell, around 30 to be precise.  Poured from a 473ml can into a Duvel tulip.  A: This beer is truly arrogant from the get-go: exploding right out of the can and into my sink, jeez Arrogant Bastard. Colour is a deep tawny brown, cloudy or hazed? Hard to tell, I’m gonna say hazed, with a sand-coloured head that simmers down after the initial explosion leaving a nice thin blanket, and lace. 8/10.  S: Boozy from the off, with a mix of dark fruits (prune, plum, dates) and a freight train full of molasses - this thing is as unstoppable as a train with Jon Voight riding on it. Aroma comes across with a decent amount of sugar but not a truckload, it’s not Founders Curmudgeon in that respect (my dentist BANNED me from drinking that beer when I told him a piece of my tooth broke off while I was sipping it). Pretty balanced aroma based on several scientific whiffs. 9/10.   T: Booze, booze, booze. Dark fruits (prune, plum, dates) and molasses. Much like BBAAB (as in the other Arrogant Bastard) there are woody notes throughout. Sweet mid palate, but not overbearing, bit better balanced than Curmudgeon in that respect - Curmudgeon is a bit “all aboard sugar train heading for candy mountain!”. Finish is long dry, with a medium herbal hop bitterness. Overall flavour is tasty, the booze isn’t crazy in your face, and there’s plenty going on. 8/10.  M: Definitely no Curmudgeon when it comes to mouthfeel - medium bodied with a slight creamy carbonation - had better, had worse. 7/10.  D: Yes I know Founders Curmudgeon is a different style beer but it’s the beer that most springs to mind as I sip this... I miss my Curmudgeon days (which are paradoxically behind me). I feel after drinking half a glass that the hops are a tad aggressive now (I found that in BBAAB too). Still decent though. 9/10.  Food match: “Runaway train never going back, pastrami salad is a beautiful snack”.","  rDev Dark, copper-red body topped with a dense, stick, sculpted head; rings and sheets of lacing sticking to the glass. Malt aroma with a note of earthy spiciness. Sweet caramel flavors infused with a peppery zing; some alcohol tones. Heavy body; coarse on the palate; relatively dry finish.  Over all these years I have no recollection of trying this beer. Regardless, it definitely has a strong, malt-forward character with a boozy quality. Old school and very appealing...","  rDev 22oz bottled 10/2/17 poured into an Arrogant Bastard shaker pint at fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours bright light reddish brown with light brown head. The aroma is faint with pine and earthy smells. The taste is more pine and earth. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, very good. Maybe better in my memories, but one of my first real holy cow beers.","  rDev -bERLIN-BREWED vERSION L: -pours a cloudy copper-brown with a big,frothy,sand-coloured head -medium to high carbonation visible S: -raisins,syrupy,piney,grassy,plums T: -pine,resin,plums,cherries,nutty -high bitterniss for the style F: -medium,smooth carbonation -medium body O: After all those years Arrogant Bastard still delivers as a great Beer.","  rDev Pours a deep, dark ruby red coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells faintly of biscuity, caramel malt, toffee and red berries, with a hint of citrus and pine. Taste follows the nose, with a firm, slightly sweet and caramelly malt presence backed up by bitter, resinous, hops and notes of pine, toffee, red berries: redcurrant, strawberry and citrus: grapefruit, lime peel, as well as just a hint of chocolate. Finishes with a strong bitterness and some red berries and pine lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation  This is an expertly crafted and balanced Amber Ale that has great complexity to it without sacrificing drinkability. The balance between sweet malts and quite bitter, resinous hops is exceptional here, with some nice layers of citrus and red berries, as well as slight toffee and chocolate notes inbetween. Arrogant Bastard will forever be my go-to beer, as long as I can get it fresh anyway. While some might say that this ages nicely, it really needs that resinous bitterness to work in my opinion, which really starts to fade out after about 10+ weeks.","  rDev Poured 16oz can into snifter. Dark brown with some copper highlight and a 2 finger khaki head. Fades slowly and leaves behind lacing that coats my glass. Aroma is very earthy and piney from the hops then mellows into a sweeter caramel malt. Flavor starts bitter, very earthy and woody, some caramel in the middle. Hints of citrus and piney bitter finish similar to a hoppy barleywine. Feel is medium with good carbonation and a dry finish. I was hoping for a bit more malt, but it is enjoyable.","  rDev Arrogant Bastard Ale brewed by Arrogant Brewing, with an ABV of 7.20% This American Strong Ale pours out a deep, deep golden amber color with a nice off white head. The color is more of a brown than a amber. There is a lot of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich, with grassy grains and malts. You also pick up a nice mild hop bitterness, in the smell as well. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on a hop bitterness lots of it to. Then the brew mellows out with the grassy grains and malts. The hop bitterness is a nice note to this style of brew. There is a lot going on in Arrogant Bastard Ale, it is bold with flavors. The body of this brew is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy. However the body is heaver than most brews on the market. This Strong Ale has a lot going on in it, the hop bitterness is what makes this brew stand out from the rest. Even with the strong hop bitterness there , this brew has a real nice balance to it. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. It is really hard to pick up on 7.20% ABV in this brew. This strong ale just goes down that smooth. The mouth feel of Arrogant Bastard Ale is Bold, Hops, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving Arrogant Bastard Ale a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the chance to. If you are looking for a bold tasting brew with lots of hops, look this brew up. Arrogant Brewing, did a real super nice job with American Strong Ale.","  rDev Poured from a 16 oz can into a glass.  This is an excellent-looking beer. Dark, reddish-amber with a perfect tan foamy head. It just looks like a good beer, and all that that entails. Not beautiful, but ruggedly handsome.  Aromas of hops and toasted grains are very forward, with just a hint of ester-y banana and a touch of booze in the background. Very aggressive bitter aromas, with the roasted and malted ones taking a bit of a backseat. Well-balanced, yet in your face.   The flavor is a study in amazing balance between a variety of disparate, and prominent notes. Whereas the nose featured more bitterness, the palate is assaulted on the front end with a healthy dose of diacetyl and cocoa sweetness, followed by toasted grain, and finished with some strong, yet judicious hoppy bitterness. The hops are strong, but far short of an IPA, lending a citrusy, but not quite piney quality that is just about perfect.   The mouthfeel is down the middle medium, but it is definitely a dry finish, helped along by the hops and booze that arrive at the finish. Neither cloyingly sweet nor overwhelmingly bitter.   I've passed on this cocky offering a myriad of times, for whatever reason. Maybe I thought the name and the description on the label seemed  gimmicky.  Not so upon finally tasting this. It defies categorization. It has the malty sweetness of a dark ale, mixed with a hoppy, but not  hop head  crispness that keeps me coming back for more. Kudos to this brewer for combining so many strong aspects into one cohesive, cocky brew. I dare you to drink just one.","  rDev Can dated  enjoy by 08-21-17  into pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy ruby brown witha persistent light tan head. Initial impression is roasted malts and a hint of caramel, but very subtle. Medium mouthfeel -a lot thinner than I expected. Carbonation is medium. Finish is slightly bitter. Overall, an interesting but not particularly compelling take on the style.","  rDev Taste: rich, smooth, malty, roasted flavors balance well with just the right amount of hops for this style. Mildly spice malt nose. Deep mahogany/copper hue, mostly clear, with a tan head and some lace. Medium/full body. Very drinkable.","  rDev After all this time finally getting to this brew. Deep brown with a tan froth. Tea, caramel and big pine to the nose. The pine and tea take the palate over and little else is noticed except for some fruit here there. Lighter than expected (medium range). If I would have had this ten years ago I would be impressed. As it stands today it is just not my thing."]},{"Name":"Celebration","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/1904/","Brewery":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":6.80,"Score":92.0,"Comments":["  rDev Canned 10/12/21; drank 11/22/21 @ the Yarchives.

Fruit punch, dry pine, mild caramel &amp; faint fresh soap flavors.   Balanced but still very hop forward. I was blown away. This is a classic for a reason.","  rDev 12oz can. A rich and robust IPA with a solid malt backbone. Fresh, leafy hops add bitterness. This is exactly how I see the American style of IPA starting out, as a New World interpretation of the original English IPA. There’s resin in the background but it’s not an all-out hop bomb. Instead, the hops offer stewed tea astringency with the roasted malt playing an equal role. Looks great as well. Good stuff.","  rDev Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a nice opaque orange with slightly off-white head. Good retention. First note from the nose is toffee. Then comes a nice layer of pine. Floral, Christmas candy, and plums. Taste is incredible. A really nice mix of hops and toffee. Sweet with a bitter aftertaste. Nice spicy and floral notes come through. Grapefruit peel. Malts. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, a really nice IPA.

The flavor has malt sweetness, some fresh hop tanginess, resin and moderate to high hop bitterness.  This is a welcome seasonal favorite.","  rDev Two 12 oz. bottles poured into a clear glass liter mug and what have we here? Well, it's foamy, let's pause bottle number two until the head ebbs a little. Until then it's a copper colored brew, with the afore mentioned copious head which is leaving a tremendously thick layer of glass lacing. It has a nice aroma of a good hop-malt combination. Time for the taste test: it's wonderful as it begins light on both hops and malts, then both emerge simultaneously. This is as earthy malt pronounced as Victory's Hop Devil and as well hopped. Truly full flavored with roasted malts and complex hop contributions, this is an outstanding AIPA.","  rDev Slightly","  rDev Bottled 9/29/20  I'm shocked that after 2 years into my beer journey that I haven't yet tried this one. I always see it discussed as one of the best value beers around, and now I have to see what it's all about  Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  This immediately smells very toasty and balanced. Notes of dark bread, fresh cut pine, general citrus, candied peach, and caramel malt  The front end of the sip is loaded with crisp malt and fresh citrus to cut through it. The swallow brings sharp pine, bready malt, brown sugar, and a touch of pepper  A hefty medium body combines with very mild carbonation for a very smooth drinking beer. Finishes mostly dry and slightly bitter  After drinking this one, all I can wonder is why I ignored it for so damn long! Just incredible stuff, absolutely in line with everything I've heard about it. I can definitely see myself stocking up on this one throughout the winter","  rDev I have been drinking this one for years, and I cannot believe I have never rated it until tonight. It’s almost 4 months old, and you’d think a fresh hop beer at that age would be quite faded, but I think it’s still pretty spot on and hasn’t lost much. A very red/tan color with frothy head and lacing. Smell is piney and mildly citrusy, as is the taste, with a bit of maltiness. Medium body, sharp, crisp, mouth watering, juicy, slight booze presence. What’s really great is it’s amazing year in and year out, which says something about their hops. I really love this beer. I’ll try to remember to revisit my rating with my first one of 2020’s edition to see what i think of it fresher.  2020 note: I’m drinking my third of this year, bumped the taste up from 4.25 to 4.75 and thus affected the entire rating. It’s a classic IPA in this day and age when everything has to be happier, juicier, and more in your face. It’s got that old West Coast bitterness that meshes well with the raw fresh hop taste so well. I find myself buying a lot of this every year, and it NEVER disappoints.","  rDev Drank this on a tap poured in to a pint glass. Nice foamy head and lacing, Amber color. Smells citrusy. Tastes citrus and piney. Hop forward, with a malt finish. Smooth creamy mouth feel. Overall, since it is the holidays, I would order again, especially since NC beers were $3.50 a pint on special at the local pizza place.  Overall a very solid seasonal. Cheers!","  rDev Canned 10/01/21, and reviewed 11/08/21, so 5 weeks old, from can, whose 6pk was refrigerated at the store. The original rating (L :4.25 |S :3.75 |T:4 | F: 4 |O:4 | BA Rating 3.96, rDev : -5%) was with a bottle that was from September, tasted in December, and not refrigerated, so at least 6 weeks older than this one.   Translucent orange-amber, with two fingers of long-lasting pale tan head, that leaves 1/4  ring, two-bubbles-deep surface sheeting, and substantial(1 +) lacing that covers about half the surface area in that zone.   Smell is orange rind, pine, and a bit of biscuity malt .   Taste is similar to aroma, but with a slight edge to the pine. Moderate, lingering bitterness.  Feel is initially creamy, then smooth and barely slick, with very,very fine soft carbonation bite. Slightly drying finish, that lingers awhile.  Overall, I now see why this is eagerly anticipated by so many. It first showed up here at three weeks old, rather than the usual eight to ten weeks . It makes a difference! Give it a try , if you like old-school WCIPAs.","  rDev Bottled 10/02/19 so it's pretty fresh. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Great amber color with a thick and creamy half inch, long lasting head. Good carbonation and lacing. Rich sweet, malty aroma and hops. Taste is smooth, malty, hoppy blend that's not too strong. Has some bitterness but still very likeable. A rather thin mouthfeel that makes for easy drinking. Nice on the back-end. Overall a nice blend that's sure to satisfy the IPA connoisseur.","  rDev L- Pale chestnut, clear, pours with 2cm white head [ps 10mins later, 3mm head still holding well] S- I get little from it. Vaguely beery, but nothing I can pin down. T- Quite hoppy/dry/contemporary but rather thin in parallel for a 6.8%. The contempory IPA hopping (rather too prominent to me) continues. A few sips in I'm getting a more rounded flavour, the rich notes coming through, and I'm thinking this is a hipster beer, but for a more mature and sophisticated audience. F- Hipster in style, but rich enough to bring a facet of adult indulgence. It's modern and hoppy but isn't out to make kiddy bludgeoning statements. O- Has the hipster hop-bomb matured, it's beard greyed a touch and got somewhat wiser? It's still unecessarily over-hopped (aka out of balance) to me, but should work for a more mature audience who favour hop-centric beers, 330ml, BB: 01/10/2020 Bought from Wholefoods London W8 £2.99.","  rDev 12 oz bottle 10/11/19 Samuel Adams Ugly Sweater pint glass Here we go.   A deep toasted caramel color with an off-white head of 2 fingers, very creamy, receding to a bubbly half-finger.   Aroma is of mouth-watering citrusy hops and medium-dark toast. Slight wet evergreen pops up behind that with notes of persimmon and mango.   A formidable tongue-scraping bitterness starts this off, (I forgot how unflinchingly bitter west coast IPAs can be) with heavy notes of pine, toffee, toasted pumpernickel, sweet brown sugar, lemon peel, grapefruit peel, and banana peel. Fading notes of evergreen, pine cone, and bitter hop dust. It is a palate scrubber for sure.   Feel is creamy and smooth, with enough carbonation and alcohol warmth to keep it exciting. Nearly perfect alcohol warmth, it is an artistic move and a winter warmer for sure.   Overall a very very good west coast style IPA if you don't mind tongue scrubbing bitterness. I gravitate towards milder IPAs myself, but this will satisfy any traditional hop head. Merry Christmas.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a nonic glass.  Pours a reddish amber with just a touch of haze. An excellent three-fingered foamy light-tan head slowly subsides and gives way to excellent lacing. Very small bubbles constantly rise from the bottom of the glass.  Mild caramel malt, citrus zest, floral and grassy hops, and just a bit of pine resin all hit the nose.   The brew is spectacularly balanced and flavorful. The caramel malts manifest in a honey-graham sweetness up front, but there is a fine earthy, grassy, and floral (lavender?) hop profile in mid-quaff that provides an outstanding counterpoint. Citrus and pine resin arrive at the finish with just a hint of warming alcohol. No one thing stands out, but each separate note is distinguishable from the others, even as they are marrying one another quite well.  The brew is solidly medium. It trends toward a drying, nearly crisp finish, thanks to some excellent but not overwhelming carbonation. It finishes with a bit of herbal warmth from the alcohol.  Very restrained in its bitterness, particularly for the style, Celebration is one tasty well-balanced brew. Not quite as malty as a DIPA, but not trying to win a withering IBU battle either. Smooth and very drinkable.","  rDev I guess 9 years is a good milepost to revisit an old favorite -- what with so much discussion about the Celebration being had.  2019 batch, bottled 10/07/19.  Poured into my imperial Nonic.  L -- Clear, deep bronze color with a dense and sticky off-white head that holds up very well.  S -- Light pine, mild citrus, and bright fruit esters of peach or apricot.  Some peppery alcohol and light caramel back.  T -- Pine resin up front with stone fruit juiciness and peppery alcohol.  Biscuit malt and light caramel balance the hops and their bitterness without grabbing the limelight.  Spicy and bitter herbal hop character rounds out the aftertaste and finish with a lingering malt sweetness present.  M -- Mouthfeel is syrupy and almost sticky.  Body is medium robust to robust.  O -- A classic masterpiece that always takes me back in time to those early years of discovering beer beyond macro swill.  Not a beer for the meek with its hop dominance, but well worth any new beer drinker's experience to understand flavorful beer -- let alone understanding that good beer in the U.S. really has been around nearly 40 years.  December 13, 2010 review: Never reviewed this one in the past -- a perfect, 13° day in N. Illinois to fit the beer!  A -- Hazy amber-orange with a resilient, foamy, off white head.  S -- Piny, citrus, spicy &amp; earthy nose. The vaguest of biscuit malt back.  T -- Spicy, pine resin hops up front that blend into citrusy esters. Biscuit malt flavor in the middle is low and clean with some mild sweetness that helps to balance, but certainly doesn't overpower, the resiny bitterness in the finish and aftertaste.  M -- Body is medium with the bitterness creating a near astringent sensation in the mouthfeel. Otherwise, the mouthfeel behind the resins is rather smooth, not at all unattenuated.  D -- This beer is delicious, which adds to its drinkability, but the resinous mouthfeel and alcohol become a little fatiguing. This would be a nice sipper on a cold afternoon in a quiet, cozy pub. 4 | 4 | 4 | 3.5 | 3.5 = 3.85","  rDev Bottled on 10/14/19  Pours a clear burnt orange-copper body topped towering thick head of off-white foam; excellent retention produces a rocky cap while leaving a comprehensive spatter of soapy, webby lacing clinging around the glass.  Aroma is a touch quiet but steadily balanced, highlighting floral notes to welcome in wisps of fresh ruby red grapefruit and orange pulp; malt tones redolent of cinnamon and nutmeg building to the finish.  Taste features tangerine and grapefruit rind comfortably integrating piney hops; gritty, rich malt imparting tones of cinnamon and nutmeg mashing with earthy resin and returning citrus peel through the finish.  Mouthfeel shows a medium body with moderate-high carbonation; pillowy mid-palate and extensively clean and taut throughout; malt sweetness seeps into a subdued bitter swallow.  Exceptional consistency meets a ripe harmony of (fresh) hops and malt, with the unique maltier aspects imparting a complexity to match the simplicity of the hop profile. Another well-done Sierra Nevada brew emphasizing quiet character and nuance, and one I could enjoy repeatedly.","  rDev rated years ago but time for a review. 2021 can into a nonic pint glass. pours a very festive dark red to almost amber with three fingers of soapy white foam head. while this beer’s appearance might scream christmas it’s nose embodies autumn and crisp, cool weather more than extreme winter cold. resinous pine all over the nose. a bit of malt. taste is an exquisite blend of malt and hops. wonderfully and pleasantly full mouthfeel rounds out a great drinking experience. this is one i look for every year, which as the years go by, the beers i look for annually get less and less it seems. this is my companion to raking leaves and other fall yard work, to grilling in cooler temps and for snowed-in weekends. a perfect example of fresh hop and west coast / old school IPA that works in the autumn or in the winter. here’s to celebration ale!","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; packaged 10/23/18 -- 2018 production year.

But I respect other types of beer, so here it is: Poured out of the bottle into an Erdinger wheat glass (sorry IPA guys ;-) Got a very nice head that retains for quite a while, I like it!!! Smells hoppy like it should for an IPA but does not bite your nose. The taste is smooth and the hops are not overpowering. Carbonation is just right, feels good! In the end, well it's an IPA and not my kind of beer! But I think this one is not bad at all ;-)","  rDev Pours a very old school deep orange/amber for an IPA. Nice off white head with great retention and great carbonation. Smell is brightly piney with light citrus notes and a pleasant crackery sweetness. Again showing a very old school bent compared to the tropical fruit salad of modern american IPAs. Taste is pleasantly balanced between sharply bitter pine hops and rich bready malt. Reminiscent of a hoppy amber or red ale. The sweet/bitter flavor dance plays out well across the whole flavor. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp with an adequate body. This is definitely a classic crisp IPA.  This is a classic and an old favorite of mine but I do feel like it's showing its age. Not so exciting as it once was and certainly not the best fresh hop beer available anymore. A nice yearly treat none the less though.","  rDev Serving: Bottle (2018) Bottled: Oct-15-2018   A: Pours a crystal clear, ruddy amber with a monstrous root beer float head. Great retention; doily lacing. (4.5)  S: Bright pithy, piney West coast hopping and a little spicy, caramely malt. (4.25)  T: Follows the nose.

The nose is pungently hoppy but not overbearing. Bright pine and bitter citrus. There is also some nice malt character and both carry over into the flavor. It is easy to drink and we'll balanced between the various parts of the proverbial whole. An excellent beer that I will seek out in future years. Sucks that it isn't more available outside the US as a seasonal (or in Quebec at least). Glad I have 5 more to drink. (4.25)","  rDev Nice clean, crisp IPA that pours a nice amber color with decent fluffy white head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of nice fruity and piney hops. Tastes of fairly juicy fruit - orange, pineapple, lemon - as well as fainter piney hops, caramel, bread and a great malt backbone. Clean smooth thin mouthfeel, good carbonation. A nice, easy to drink IPA but not that exciting - and that makes it a little disappointing considering the other reviews here.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle 10/02/18 into the test pint glass. A - Deep copper color, wonderful clarity, active carbonation, a pillow of off white resides topside S - Sweet malt, surrounded by earthy hops, some hints of caramel, and white pepper.

Decidedly earthy and malty like an amber, it simply lacks pop. slightly musty like an old beer, but this is fresh. Doing get me wrong...It is still a pretty solid beer. It just isn't special. On the other hand, I'll still buy it next year.","  rDev From Decervecitas. 2017 version. In Teku glass. Playing Bloo Kid 2. Smooth feeling and great aspect, with a thick, persistent foam.

Aroma is a really nice blend of hops with malt in the background. Taste is very similar, the bitter hops are there but really softened nicely by the malt. I'm not an ipa drinker typically but I found this to be really very enjoyable","  rDev Pours a cloudy, dark amber coloration with a large, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of biscuity, slightly grainy and caramelly malt and resinous, citrus hops, with notes of grapefruit and pine. Taste is an excellent balance of biscuity, caramel, slightly grainy malt and fruity, bitter and resinous hops, with notes of grapefruit, orange peel and pine, Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and some grapefruit and pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This makes for a great old school IPA with a certain East Coast vibe, the bitter, resinous hops being balanced against a strong, slightly sweet malt backbone perfectly. The first time I had this it was over two years old and I was really impressed by how much resinous bitterness was still left in it, although the sweet malts had clearly taken over. Now, at four months old, those bitter, resinous hops and citrus notes clearly shine through a lot more distinctly, making for and even more enjoyable brew. There certainly is a reason that this is a classic and I really wish that I could get my hands on this even more fresh and regularly, although it really is a beer that keeps up incredibly well.","  rDev ** 01/31/15  On tap at wildflowers too.

A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass. The aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway. First sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation. Flavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related.

The pour created a beautiful two-fingered off-white head. The head is airy and creamy with excellent retention. The head dissipated slowly, leaving chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 7, goldenrod with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with some carbonation bubbles dancing within the liquid.   The initial aromas are floral, fruity esters, white pepper, and malty sweetness. Nosing further, I detect cloves, oranges, biscuit, toasted malts, a hint of banana, and some hint of pharmaceutical.   The flavors in the beer are banana, cloves, oranges, toasted crackers, fruity esters, spicy hops, pepper, malty sweetness, a touch of band-aids, biscuity, caramel, and leather.   The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic, warming, and slick.   The body of the beer is medium, medium-high carbonation, and a full finish.   The interplay with the hops, yeast, and alcohol is above average. Good harmony in the beer with a firm backbone. I was not a fan of the higher than usual alcohol warming I was getting on the finish. I did enjoy this beer.","  rDev a: slighly hazy dark orange &amp; copper color. a touch of pale yellow and light brown. huge 4 finger marshmellow-like white head  s: wheat, banana, green pear, green apple. coriander, cardamom, and pepper spice. nice Belgian yeast spice. huge crackery note, and a doughy malt backbone. a touch of clove and nutmeg. a little bit of an earthy/grass note as well. absolutely amazing and complex aroma on this  t: huge fruity esthers upfront. ripe green pears, green apple, and a big sweet banana note. pepper spice immediately following that for balance, as well as clove and a hint of coriander. a touch of wheaty bubblegum-like flavors. crusty country bread and dry crackers. a touch of sweet malt then apple, pear, and that nice Belgian spice to close it out  m: solid medium mouthfeel with extremely high carbonation  o: extremely awesome beer, and definitely a benchmark for the style. complex, well-harmonized, yet easy to drink and it doesn't tax you to drink it, even though it has a high ABV. awesome stuff","  rDev How in the flying fudge izzit that I have NEVER reviewed this beer?!? OMFG! Unibroue's head brewer, Jerry Vietz &amp; I go 'way back! There are some tales to which I have been sworn to secrecy so fair dinkum! Here's one on me: It was PHL Beer Week in its earliest iteration, Year 1 or 2, in late-Spring &amp; it was still bitterly cold out. Jerry &amp; I had crossed paths at several events over the course of the day &amp; now, it was my nightcap at Fergie's as I headed to my nearby hostel. I engaged with a pair at the bar &amp; then, according to Jerry, since I was no longer there, I lapsed into fluent French! 8=O The couple could no longer understand me, but Jerry acted as interpreter! I could not remember a whit of it, but Jerry assured me that I was appropriate, that my tongue &amp; mouth had not one word of English in it &amp; that I was far more fluent than he had believed. 8=O   I had four (4) years of French in Middle &amp; High School, despite my protestations that Spanish would be more useful. My first overseas liberty port in the Navy? Barcelona, Spain! 8={} I am apparently a natural for languages &amp; pick up on them very quickly. I soon learned to (ahem!) procure my (ahem!) date for the import period for the duration of our stay. We would eat &amp; drink on the local economy, go to a movie or two &amp; she would teach me her language. My mother was once shocked by an offhand comment &amp; inquired as to how many languages I speak. I have ~ thirty (30) &amp; I will lapse into some of them without thinking, hence her question. My tour as a plankowner onboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) had us in France so often that by Marseille, Christmas 1991, our chargé (local ambassador) requested me as her liaison! A billet normally reserved for an officer, but my fluency was tremendous. Years of disuse have rendered it poor again, but send me to Quebec &amp; watch!   From the Bottle (!):  Belgian Style Triple Ale ;  Ale Brewed with Spices ;  Bottle Refermented .  Pop! the cap time! Blast! It was one of those screwed-up screw-off caps! 8={} I mustered up all of my self-control &amp; began a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. Man, if there is one thing that I hate more than bottles, it is screw-cap bottles! It foamed up beautifully to create two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. Color was a deeply-hazy/lightly-cloudy Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9). Nose smelled like Spring - flowery - orchids, daisies, honeysuckle; honey; black pepper; old newspapers from the attic for recycling. Mmm. Mouthfeel was medium, seemingly light, but on-par for the style. The taste, while spicy, was imprecisely peppery. Coriander, perhaps? Star Anise? Lots of honey, perhaps from the malt. Plus a flowery, perfume-y sweetness. Mmm. 9%, you say?!? Unbelievable! It was entirely smooth &amp; so easy-drinking as to render it about as dangerous as I have encountered in a while. This was definitely one to remain full aware of throughout! Finish was dry, largely due to the inclusion of spices, but even then, it might have been fairly dry on its own. It might be interesting to have them brew a non-spiced batch, just for comparison purposes. I'll inquire of Jerry on our next meeting. YMMV.","  rDev Best by 8/29/22, still plenty of time left on this one lol  Pours a light copper-y orange with 2 fingers of fluffy white head that takes quite some time to begin fading  Aroma is big on the fruity note of the Belgian yeasty, very overripe in nature, with mild spice and herbality to back it up  The taste follows the nose, the yeast almost being a little tart in conjunction with the spice, very flavorful without being overkill  Drinks very nice, more wildly carbonated than I expected but boy does it work for this. Medium body and finishes just shy of dry with a bit of sweetness to leave behind  Overall I really enjoyed this one, deserves all the praise it gets","  rDev A clear orange-amber body with a profusion of bubbles rising to a thick, creamy white head with excellent retention. The head sags a bit below an outside ridge as it recedes. As you drink, it leaves spots, strings and sheets of lacing. (The final drops from the bottle send columns of dark brown down through the beer, becoming smokey sheets wafting through the beer.) Great looking beer.  Aroma is fruit and spice. Ripe pears, cloves, hints of banana, bubblegum.  Smooth and substantial body, accented by the carbonation dancing on the tongue.  The mixture of fruit flavors and spices dominate the taste. Ripe pears, apricot, clove, pepper, banana. A bit of funkiness. A wonderful, tasty, complexity of flavors swirling around above a bready sweet malt foundation. The finish is slightly thick and semi-sweet. Rich, elaborate, sophisticated, and wonderfully multifarious.  Overall, this is a great beer. The best Belgian Tripel-style I've had to date.","  rDev Clear light gold with three or more fingers of white head. Rings of lace form as the head drops. Smell is pungent yeast character. Mild malts. Taste is typical of a Belgian Trippel. Bold yeast lightly sweet some mild herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light to medium with strong carbonation. The finish is dry and balanced. Overall a very authentic Trippel that is brewed in Canada. Picked up at local Trader Joes for $7.99. Get some now.","  rDev Bottle at Las Buenas Pulgas, served in a Chimay glass. Pours a golden colour, medium head with long retention, reducing to a permanent thin layer. Creamy lacing  Aroma of cloves, bananas, plums, ripened fruits, phenols, green apples, cinnamon, almonds. Medium body, sticky texture, active carbonation, sweet alcoholic finish.  Taste is just like the aroma. A beast of a beer. Wonderful.","  rDev Pours a lightly foggy orange-yellow with two fingers of dense, off-white foam. Head retention is great with a foamy ring lasting long after the first sip. Aroma is heavy Belgian yeast with a little bit of spice, heavy clove and modest banana. In addition to the zesty yeast is stone fruit, cellar stone, and a pinch of nutty malt. It's smooth and well developed, with each flavor cascading into the next. Flavor profile is clove, banana and heavy zesty yeast. Nutty, earthy, caramely malts create a firm base, while bits and pieces of cardamon and nutmeg come sprinkling through for a little additional depth. Alcohol is modest, but does come poking through towards the finish. Mouth feel is thick and filling with a soft, fuzzy texture that is reminiscent of a well-worn, comfy wool sweater. Overall, zesty with a little bit of spice (not hot spice) for a well-rounded and dynamic Belgian Triple.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Extremely clear, golden amber body; robust carbonation; head is very dense and creamy, sticky. Sweet and spicy aroma; pear. Deceptively light malt taste; excellent hop bitterness; sweet and fruity esters; alcohol presence is there yet nicely balanced in the mix. Heavy body; coarse and rippling on the palate; a touch of sweetness but noticeably dry overall.  I understand why this tripel is world class. I hardly drink them, mainly because I have it in my mind that they are rough and hot on the palate. This beer certainly has some alcohol punch, but it's nicely offset with some fine, relatively delicate sweetness and excellent fruit-like quality (I'm again thinking pears). This is a beautiful beer, bold and complex with added subtlety to keep things interesting.","  rDev Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. Best by date is stamped on bottle as 'BB 10-04-20'. Hazy, pale gold colored body. Initial pour results in white, mostly foamy head, which takes a few minutes to settle. Each subsequent pour brings back the head, but less in volume each time. Patterns of lacing are left behind with each sip. Aroma of pear, banana, melon, cloves, light vanilla, and bready malts. Taste has green apple, pear, banana, melon, citrus lemon, light vanilla, clove, and grassy like malts. Toward a full mouth feel. The citrus at the end makes it a little dry. High carbonation levels. Really a sublimely made beer with lots of flavors and very balanced. Such a treat.","  rDev Maybe not what I would taste last if the end of the world was coming, but it's still darn good...  The Unibroue brews have a hazy look to them that I have a love-hate relationship with. On the one hand they kinda look nice, but then they have this weird look to them that makes me wrinkle my nose. The smell was unique - I call it,  Wheaty sweet  and I really liked it. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, quite carbonated, but it had a creamy texture that the carbonation could not deny. At 9% ABV, the sweetness I smelled still came through the boozy flavor adding something more to it that I found appealing. Overall, I found this to be exceptional and probably the best of their offerings I have had to date.","  rDev L: Hazy, translucent deep gold with an enormous rocky white head. Very long retention, with lots of streaky lacing.   S: Lots of apple, pear, banana, straw, and clove; but instead of leaning sweet, it leans toward fragrant and floral; delicate with soft vanilla, honeydew melon, white grape, and sugar cookie.  T: Tart apple, pear, banana, lemon, orange, hay, biscuit, sugar cookie, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, white grape/white wine, and vanilla. Dry on the finish with hay and clove. Well balanced. Neither too sweet from the malt, nor too dry from the phenolics.  F: Highly carbonated. Feels so smooth and pillowy. Extremely well rounded. Finishes dry but not bone-dry, oh so well balanced.  O: One of the best tripels I've ever had, by far. Amazing.","  rDev Pours cloudy amber orange with a creamy white foam head. Notes of sweet caramelized golden bready malts, banana, clove spice, hint of apricot, orange citrus, with floral earthy herbal grassy hops. Feels medium bodied, creamy with smooth moderate carbonation. Overall a really nice tripel.","  rDev Poured into a small chalice: color is hazy copper, head is brighter white with fine bubbles and presents about 1/2 inch thick and then dissipates to thin top with some spotty lacing.  Smell is light fruitiness, some yeast, light phenol and clove.   Taste is very good with pleasant light citrus and tropical fruit flavor, flavor then transitions to blend of light malt with biscuit and wheat notable, yeast with phenols and dryness, almost some weizen like flavors. Strength hidden very well by the flavor profile.   Mouthfeel is a highlight of this beer - pleasant with moderate carbonation, light sweetness and just enough dryness - nothing to detract.  Overall a great beer with slightly different take on than some other with a lighter presence with some softer malts; incredible flavor without the abv presence.","  rDev Pours hazy honey orange with large fluffy white head that sticks around for a while. The aroma is floral clove and fruitiness. The flavor is much more fruit forward than the aroma the aliceynes doesn't really come into play until the finish. It's fairly estery, but the sweetness overplays it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with frothy carbonation. It's not overly bubbly, but is still very noticeable. Overall, it's overly sweet. I haven't had a ton of tripels and need to make the effort to branch out into the style.","  rDev Dark yellow in color with a hazy appearance. Poured with thick, soapy, bright white foam with good retention. Aromas of fruity pear, estery banana and pepper, bready yeast, candy sugar and sweet malt. Medium light bodied with effervescent, tangy carbonation and mellow warmth near the finish. Flavors are similar to aromas. Estery banana and light peppery notes, sweet sugary malt, light fruity pear. Medium, earthy, tangy hop bitterness through the middle. Finished semi-dryly with light boozy heat, yeasty and light fruity notes. Booziness is wonderfully masked making this dangerously drinkable. Fantastic array of complex flavors. An excellent triple.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; best by 12-01-19. A: Pours a very hazy, amber color, resembling an unclarified cider, with very exuberant head formation, leading to a two to three inch head initially, but only modest head retention and soapy, limited lacing. S: Pungent. Aromas of caramel malt, cloves, and fruit (apple, peach, and banana), as well as complex spice notes.  T: Cloves meet the palate initially followed by a complex mix of the elements of nose. Bitterness present but subtle and nicely in balance. M: Full bodied and thick in the mouth; solid persistent effervescence causing tingling on the palate. O: I first encountered this in Québec in 2008 and have enjoy it many times. Really a world class Tripel.","  rDev 12 oz bottle best by 12-01-19 poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy orange with a medium large carbo release, a two finger fluffy head the slowly recedes through the glass. The aroma is of yeast, spices (coriander and pepper mainly) , and mild banana/clove. The taste follows suit, with only a slight bubblegum sweet addition to the mix. The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is medium to medium high at the start, and mellows out as it warms. Always wanted to try this one. I like how the taste is well balanced and not quite as in your face. Recommended if you like Tripels.","  rDev Gold yellow color with just above average carbonation. Strong pleasant aroma of yeast followed by malt,hops,and spice. Not one element overwhelms and every element is present but sort of needs to be discovered instead of it blowing up on your taste buds. A great triple that seems a step above most triples.","  rDev From Saveur-Biere. In La Trappe chalice. Watching Los Soprano 6x02. Had great expectations and didnt dissapoint. Perfect tripel. All typical notes of the style perfectly assembled. Superb aroma. Found myself enjoying it just by its aroma. Abv very well hidden. Left me wanting more","  rDev Pours a deep golden honey color with huge fluffy white head leaving plenty of lacing. Nose is zesty with citrus and yeast. Taste follows in typical Belgian tripel fashion. This is true to the style. Could easily actually be from Belgium.","  rDev This is a great tripel with nice bready and malty aromas and a taste that exemplifies the style. Looks good and has an ample amount of carbonation. Leaves a nice fruity, malty feel at the end","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle, bb 12/18/17 into my St. Bernardus chalice. 9% ABV. The beer ranges from copper to gold with the light. Somewhat hazy but I poured the whole bottle aggressively. A half inch of white head fades to nothing but a thin ring with no lacing. Smell is slightly sweet and a little floral from the hops. Taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel is smooth and yet lively with carbonation. Overall, one of the best tripels on earth. I especially appreciate the subdued spice where other tripels are dominated by spice."]},{"Name":"Lagunitas Sucks","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/220/74986/","Brewery":"Lagunitas Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":7.85,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 ml bottle, at a breakfast joint in Petaluma. Deep golden to orange colour, large off-white head. Aroma and flavour of citrus, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Maybe a bit too far out on the sweet side for me, but still a fairly nice beer. Some alcohol in the finish. Anyway, I wouldn’t say that it sucks.","  rDev Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that.","  rDev 12oz bottle. No dating but the verbiage around the label talks about going to a brighter and wiser 2021.  Brilliantly clear, deep gold colored body. Not much of a head upon pouring but a partial white cap covers the surface. Each sip leaves behind a tiny spot sheen of lacing. Quite the enticement to rotate the glass while drinking in order to get full glass coverage.  Aroma at a chilled temperature is hidden but bready malts and resinous hops come through. Taste is full. Slightly sweet but well balanced with citrus, pine, and resin. The suggestion of bitterness is swirled and tempered by the floral sweetness. Leaves a buzz in the mouth, and the aftertaste continues the back and forth, with a resin high note. Medium mouth feel. The stickiness of the resin also expresses in the mouth. Excellent carbonation. As mentioned on the label, this is an excellent palate cleanser brew. Very expressive but without excess. Enjoyable.","  rDev Bottled 9/16/20  Not sure how this beer has more ratings than any of their others even though this is the first time I've seen it on the shelf. I imagine it'll be pretty good  Pours a clear gold with 2 fingers of white head that slowly reduces to a cap and leaves decent lacing  The nose is very classic west coast, very classic Lagunitas; just with a little more. Lots of resiny hops, orangey citrus, caramel malt, and minor notes of pineapple and mango  The flavor starts off with a nice malty sweetness, lots of toasted bread and a touch of citrus to balance it out. The swallow brings a nice flash of pine, candied peach, and even more caramel malt that lasts through the aftertaste  A medium body with subtle carbonation leads this to drink much below its abv. Finishes almost entirely dry and perfectly balanced between malty and hoppy  A pretty good beer all things considered. World class? Nah, but definitely a solid, old school ipa","  rDev 12oz bottle coded 260 0 2 (9/16/20 Chicago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 8% ABV per label. The beer pours bright light golden amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and puffy island leaving a full pattern of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring caramel malt, light citrus and pine. The taste is semisweet caramel with a nice piney, citrus rind flavor and moderate bitterness throughout. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, very good. Much better than the Santa Cookie 12 pack from a couple years ago and not as good as I remember the 32 oz bottles tasting. Old school with the Lagunitas signature flavor.","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed January 2013.  Possibly the best DIPA I've ever had. You can smell the massive hop bouquet from across the room. A truly superb beer. ","  rDev Fairly clear bright orange.   Nice white head; spotty lacing.   Marijuana &amp; grapefruit nose.   Medium mouthfeel. Overly bitter taste here; no balance.   Drinkable but not great.","  rDev From notes 3/31/13: Pours a clear pale amber producing 3 fingers of billowy, foamy, off-whit, nicely lasting head that leaves nice rings and webs of lace. Aroma is bitter grapefruit heaven, light pine resin, rye spice, caramel, and tropical fruits with some lemon. Taste is similar with the caramel more distinct but wrapped in fruit layers of orange, pineapple and grapefruit backed up by hop and rye spice and a hint of pepper in the finish. Very Lagunitas style hoppiness. The hops have a fresh or  green  taste. There is a nicely lasting fruity but bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little heavy, slightly oily and slick it is also slightly creamy and very smooth. Very, very pleasant. I need more of this.","  rDev 5/5/18: $1.66 12 oz bottle poured into chalice. Golden tan pour, light white head and lacing. Hops aroma offset by sweet fruit, mango, citrus and tangerine. Nice hops taste, completely balanced by sweet citrus and tangerine taste, sweeter than most IPAs. Carbonation holds, thin mouth feel, smooth drinking. Overall good offering.","  rDev Light amber, clean and bright. One finger of white foam. In the smell some malty notes, the citrus and tropical. The taste is more heavy, too sweet. Intense fruitiness in the aftertaste too, melon, yellow peach. Quite heavy and boring.","  rDev It pours a clear golden with a nice head. The hop presence is nice. With some tropical fruits, citrus and pine from the hops, the mix of grains and malts brings a cool west coast style taste to this beer","  rDev Lagunitas Brewing Co.  Lagunitas Sucks Brown Shugga' Substitute Ale  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, production coded but without freshness dating $2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: Well this is lighter than I was expecting, I must have been confusing it with something else although I've definitely had it before on tap. I generally don't like to do reviews in bars though, there are too many different smells going on, and too many distractions. So, OK, it's a hazy golden and there's visible particulate in suspension. I'll assume that's yeast, I saw it come out of the bottle towards the end. Ahh, it just occurred to me that maybe I thought it was darker because it appeared that way at the bar. Anyway, the head is a creamy off-white which has already dropped to a thin surface covering and wide collar. I have a beer clean glass, by the way, I used it earlier so I'm not sure what the problem here is. The aroma displays a grainy, lightly caramelish malt with citrusy fruits and a bit of pine. It's clean and fresh and welcoming. The flavor follows and I'm finding notes of orange, light brown sugar, sweetened grapefruit, pineapple, and soft pine. It's not particularly bitter given the amount of sweet bread malt that's there, but it comes through, particularly in the finish. It's sweetish upfront but balanced in the end. Some citrus and pine lingers. It's definitely medium in body, almost medium-full, and the carbonation is fairly soft leaving it gently tingly on the tongue and then smooth. Nicely done. I'm not even finding the alcohol, what is it? 8% ABV, that's not a bad trick to pull off. Quite pleasant and enjoyable; I'll have to pick up some more.","  rDev ** 01/30/2014  Pretty good. This does not suck, but I don't understand how it has become so beloved. I prefer the original Brown Shugga.   AROMA: Pine, wood, sap. LOOK: Clear yellow. Small white head. TASTE: Hoppy, pine, bitter resin. Lots of flavor, but not necessarily good flavor.  **","  rDev Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass at Taco Mac in Atlanta. The appearance is a clear bright orange color with a medium sized white head. The aroma is hop driven. The taste is hops and tropical fruit. An outstanding beer.","  rDev Picked up a 6 pack from the LCBO for about $16 CDN. Served cold into a chalice. This rendition advertised as 8% ABV.  Appearance - Pours a bright, light orange colored beer with two thirds of a finger of white head. Medium retention and some curtains of lace left around the edges of the glass. Greta clarity and prevalent carbonation in the beer.  Smell - Mango with some citrus hops, little bits of grapefruit and pineapple. Some cereal grains for balance, much more so than many a DIPA.  Taste - Light with mango, grapefruit and some pineapple. Lots of grains too for balance and a light caramel malt. Doesn't wow me, but drinakbility is huge.  mouthfeel - Slightly drying finish, booze is hidden wonderfully and probably one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had.  Overall - Overrated in terms of flavor, but underrated in terms of easy this is to drink especially for an 8% ABV beer. Really good stuff and worth a try. Certainly looking forward to buying another 6 pack, while in stock as this is dangerously easy to drink. Definitely doesn't suck.","  rDev Pours a very clear dark amber with a large head that quickly reduces to a half-inch foam with nice lacing. Aroma is a hop slap on the face. Intense pine, citrus and some dank. Taste is very similar, with the bitterness being balanced by some nice malt sweetness. Very well balanced despite the strong hop profile. This is a seriously fun DIPA, as long as you got it fresh.","  rDev I love this beer fresh and probably would have rated higher a couple years ago. First off I think the price of this beer is awesome for what you get. This is just any all around good IPA at a good price and it don't Suck!","  Pours clear brass with a foamy, long lasting head. Tons of lace chunks stick to the glass on the way down. Grapefruit, peach and tropical fruit hop notes abound in the nose, balanced by caramel cookie dough maltiness. The first sip reveals plenty of hop bitterness and fruity, citrusy hop flavors. A hefty malt profile keeps everything in check, and renders this beer less dry than most DIPAs. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a subtle, creamy carbonation. Medium bitterness, grapefruit rind and green tea mix with a bit of alcohol spice and some residual sweetness in the finish.  A very quaffable DIPA with dank, complex hoppiness and a huge malt profile. Balanced and very quaffable for the high abv. A must try.","  rDev Another Lagunitas offering and another very good brew. I still can find no real fault with this brewer.  I do have to mention though, there really ain't much special about the coloration, it was your basic amber-colored beer. The head was very white, very fluffy, but the lacing was thick and covered the glass almost all the way down the pint glass - it was actually quite impressive. The scent was a perfect, and I do mean perfect, mixture of citrus and coriander mixed with the strong hoppy smell. The mouthfeel was mostly carbonated, but not so much so to detract from the overall experience. Speaking of overall, this was truly a wonderfully crafted beer. It had the same taste as what I smelled which is a big plus in my book - making the whole beer very flavorful.","  rDev Beautiful lighter shade of gold with good cap and lacing.  Aroma is like stepping into a dark conifer forest. The hop aroma comes full on in an unobtrusive way, there's a lot of it but it's not pushy. Hints of spice dance about like a sprinkling of sunbeams lightly filtered through the boughs above.  Yes, the flavor is resinous, just like the brewery says, but it's a pleasant bunch of buds. Grains come through in the buttery rich body but it's hops that lead the band. Finish is clean with a pleasantly bitter aftertaste.  Overall this is a complex beer with positive points. It is a broad shoulder, big body, big flavor, big hop brew put together in a cohesive whole that fulfills and doesn't disappoint.","  rDev Golden and hazy with a few slow rising bubbles. Topped with a half finger of foamy white head.  Smells of cat pee, cat nip, herbal notes and a hint of lemon and fruitiness, really dank and fried onion like.  Tastes of cat pee, cat nip, herbal notes, a fair amount of what I like to think is brown sugar, and some butter.  Medium somewhat syrupy body, dry finish. Medium level of spicy carbonation.  Got in Petaluma California at the 7-11 just down from Lagunita's Brewing. Drinking in Motel 6, Petaluma. Its been on my wish list and I would have had it at Lagunita's brewhouse, but it was closed when I arrived at 10:30pm. Very hoppy in a catty kind of way, and well done but different.","  rDev Does not overpower, is quite balanced. Need to come for this and enjoy it at a quiet moment","  rDev Aroma comes on like a Belgian tripel, so far so good! Light amber with sparse foamy head. Some spicy nature in the taste, also reminiscent of Belgians, with the ever present NW hops touch. This is a really, really good beer.","  rDev A foamy creamy head that is one finger thick with good retention. The color of the beer is a nice orange color with some amber tints. The clarity of the beer is clear with some good carbonation bubble.   Rich floral, pine, and grapefruit with some tropical notes come first I smell this beer. A light grass, and toasted bread with yeast finish it.   Definite grapefruit, tropical, herbal, resin, and some floral notes on the palate. The beer is lightly toasted with a touch of caramel, grass, and yeast  The mouthfeel is bitter, tannic, carbonated, and finish crisp.   The beer is good I think the hop is a tad underwhelming to me. The malt has a very nice back and could hold a touch more hop character. Good DIPA","  rDev Back home we would say it's Wicked Good! From the older bottle, it pours a golden amber with a moderate head. Really nice scent tickles the nose (no, I don't feel like describing it) and tastes very nice. Yummy!","  rDev Looks clear golden orange with lightly streaming carbonation, a thick, sticky off white head, and leaves sheets of lacing.  On the aroma, you get pine upfront, and then zesty, spritzy citrus oils; orange peel, a bit of grapefruit, and then some underlying peach and pineapple.  On the palate, upfront you're smacked with lots of grapefruit and pithy orange. This transitions into sweeter tropical fruits; peach, pineapple, and a touch of mango. There is an underbelly of malt sweetness, biscuit bordering on caramel, but smooth and not obtrusively sweet or sugary. The finish transitions to a sharp bite of pine sap and the characteristic Lagunitas chalk/rubber note, but it's a faint suggestion here and not obnoxious and detracting like some of their other beers. Finishes surprisingly clean, neither super dry nor overly sweet, with only a touch of bitterness and lightly lingering pine needles and orange pith.  The mouthfeel is medium, medium-lightly carbonated, very smooth and bordering on creamy. Lightly dry on the finish.","  rDev Lagunitas Sucks Brown Shugga' Substitute Ale, 7.85% ABV, 63 IBU, American Double/Imperial IPA style. Well let's see if it lives up to its name. Pours medium thickness, orange/golden, a bit hazy, 5+ fingers of foamy white head that stuck around, spotty lacing. Nose is sweet malt, taste is malt and some funky bitter tastes I can't identify. OK mouthfeel, and overall I can't say it sucks, though I'm not a fan. I do like it better than the Brown Shugga' it is a substitute for!","  rDev Pours a clear, vibrant light copper in color with abut under a finger of white head, average retention. Aroma is very subdued and lacks the hop presence if expect from a DIPA. It's skewer towards caramelly malt with a touch of citrus. Taste is an improvement with spiny more citrus and some pine but a substantial malty-ish presence. There is a touch of caramel and a light sweetness that segues to a decent bitterness that balances the beer and lingers a bit in the finish. Decent mouthfeel, medium body and medium-low carbonation. Overall a good beer but not one that I expect to seek out again. I'll give this another shot if I find it again given my affinity for Lagunitas, I'm a big fan of pretty much every other beer I've had from them but I'm disappointed.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Deep clear yellow with a nice head and beautiful lacing. It is pleasantly fragrant, citrusy and floral. The taste is great! Very citrusy,smooth, slightly sweet. No overwhelming bitterness. One of the most pleasant IPAs I have had!","  rDev Revisited for 2020, poured from a bottle - clear dark gold with white head leaving bubbles and frosty lacing. Nose is a balance of grains and hops.

There's a strong aroma of roasted malt which is influenced noticeably by oak tannins. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes.

Aroma is dark roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. No coffee.  Taste is a mellow mixture of dark roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. A touch of coffee is tasted at the very end.  Thicker mouth feel, and coating. No felt carbonation but it is there as supportive. Even at its advanced age in the can, the tasting experience is excellent. Not bitter and hides the higher ABV%. Smooth and lingering.","  rDev Solid black color with light carbonation. Has an above average body with a slight thick creamy feel Aroma isn't overpowering but it is mostly black coffee, roasted coffee beans, roasted malt, and some milk and dark chocolate Taste is much more powerful than aroma with bitter black coffee being forward. There's some alcohol and the burn that goes with it but it isn't unpleasant. Some roasted malt and dark chocolate show up,coat the tongue and linger awhile Overall it's an excellent beer that's worth trying","  rDev Very nice, smooth, rich imperial stout that had a good balance between mild bitterness and malt sweetness. Pours a deep, dark, rich black color with some darker tan-copper head and some sheets of lingering lacing that stayed for about 10-15 minutes. Smells of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted nuttiness, stone fruit, malt, caramel and vanilla. Taste follows the nose, along with some brown sugar, raisin and some faint toffee. Smooth, rich, slightly sticky mouthfeel that mildly coated the palate. Good carbonation. An excellent beer and I’m looking forward to trying their barrel-aged version.","  rDev 12oz canned 8/22/18 (5 months ago) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 10.5% ABV. The beer pours dense black with reddish mocha colored head. The head recedes to a quarter inch cap and the lacing is complete and spectacular. The aroma is earthy chocolate and roast malt. The taste is semisweet roasty, ashy, bitter chocolate with hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, outstanding. The feel is the star here with taste and appearance coming closely behind. Velvety texture and a fantastic balance of sweet and bitter.","  rDev Canned 9/14/15; drank 11/26/15 @ the Yarchives.   Black appearance.   A rough pour yielded a HUGE dark khaki head (careful pouring!); strong lace.   Blackberry, fresh earth, bakers chocolate &amp; marshmallow notes in the nose.   Thick, creamy mouthfeel.   Blackberry, fresh earth &amp; bakers chocolate flavors up front; faint oat notes on the finish.   A robust stout; one for the coldest night of the year.","  rDev This beer features one of the darkest, fullest heads I Ican ever remember seeing on a beer, even a stout. Notes of fig, coffee, chocolate and black cherry accompany that monster head and jet body.   There s so much going on here it is a little overwhelmng. You have your dark fruits, roasted coffee and bakers chocolate colliding with 98 IBUs of piney hoptasticness. A bit of oatmeal smooths out that mouthfeel just right. It's quite amazing that this lives up to its outsized reputation. The ultimate deep winter stout?","  rDev Can. Fro 32GP. In Teku glass. Playing Game of Thrones. Very balanced, smooth, without an excessive sweetness and chocolatey notes. Abv fairly well hidden in flavors, although hits the head","  rDev Pours a pitch black coloration with a huge, creamy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt, dark chocolate and licorice with a hint of dark fruit, coffee and vanilla. A certain hoppy note there as well. Taste follows the nose exactly, with a complex balance being dominated by roasted, caramel malt, dark chocolate, licorice and dark fruit: fig, plum, and just a hint of coffee, vanilla and a certain hoppy, almost piny, note. Finishes with a medium, dry bitterness. Smooth, almost oily mouthfeel with a medium body and low carbonation. Quite complex and well-balanced stout, very impressive.","  rDev Just like the Bourbon Barrel Aged version of Ten FIDY (which I also had recently) this is an extremely good stout, but a tad milder (and no bourbon of course).  Look: Jet black with a thick fluffy mocca colored head  Aroma: roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit,   Taste: The flavor is chocolate brownies, roasted malts, some vanilla ice cream with coffee and dark fruit.   Feel: full body, rich, silky mouthfeel","  rDev A: solid, midnight black color. No light shining through at all. Real nice dark tan .5 finger head   S: Deep dark chocolate, roast malt, milk chocolate , some soy sauce. There is some lactose sweetness in the aroma as well  T: silky milk chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, dates, soy sauce, cola, brown sugar. There is a touch of bitterness from the roast malt, which is good because it balances out some of the sweetness. Also, some bitterness from the roast malt. Very luscious taste  M: heavy, super silky mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Definitely a sipper  O: fantastic stout. It’s heavy, rich, and silky smooth. Sip on this and enjoy!","  rDev Petroleum color that verted like motor oil with a huge and thick dark caramel head with great retention and leaving good laces. Nice aroma with notes of cocoa, vanilla, dark chocolate, a bit of smoke, licorice, pine, some roasted coffee beans and plums. Flavor with notes of cocoa, spices, pine, grapefruit citrusy, lactic acid, oats, licorice, figs, raisins, molasses, drops of bourbon, Port Wine and prunes. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Its 65 IBUs are enough to balance its robust body. Full oily body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 10.5% abv is superbly well hidden. Excellent Imperial Stout with great complexity and perfect execution. More chocolatey than coffee and once it warmed up revealed lots of dark fruit notes as well. Despite its 65 IBUs it is not very hoppy, though this exemplar has been cellared for several months. Definitely a sipper. Worth trying and revisiting given its great cost benefit ratio.","  rDev Poured from a single-serve CAN into a stout glass.  Pours---absolutely motor-oil black. Thick, viscous, and everything a stout should be. The head is perhaps the darkest tan with mottled dark brown I've ever seen, and it's sticky, foamy, and has excellent staying power considering the ABV. The foamy lacing endures throughout the drink. I don't give  5  ratings on any point lightly--this is a winner.  The aroma is a full-on assault of complexity and power. Malts very forward, manifesting mostly in dark fruit, as opposed to coffee and chocolate, though they are present as well. Smoke and burnt sugar join the party, with the hops dancing in the background. Just a hint of booze completes it.  The flavor follows the look and the nose. Dark fruits (black cherry, fig and raisin), burnt sugars, blackstrap, smoke, and espresso coffee with hops arriving at the finish to balance the party. Perhaps a bit heavy-handed on the bitter notes, but that's more a matter of personal preference than criticism.  The mouthfeel is outstanding. Thick, chewy and heavy, yet the strong carbonation and hops provide a crisp finish.  This is a top-notch RIS. A must try.","  rDev Pours into my glass looking like motor oil far past it's change by date. Chocolate and coffee blend together with the perfect hoped backbone to make this one stand out from the other imperial stout out there.","  rDev Living in the UK, this is a beer I sought out when visiting the US. Couldn't get it for a while, but was finally successful last year. I've had a few over the time, and here's my thoughts. Pours like death itself. Motor oil with a thick luscious head that has staying power and coats the glass. Nose is a bit milder than expected with rounded coffee, black licorice, and burnt sugars. Taste hit initially like it will be smooth and a touch sweet with lots of coffee and cocoa. Sadly, it quickly turns astringent and acrid. I wanted to love this beer, but the flavor just isn't that great. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Overall, what this beer does well is does magnificently, but the taste doesn't hold up.","  rDev A 12 fl oz can, canned on 13th October 2016, with a note that said “Midnight on a moonless night”. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.  Appearance: It was black in colour with a nice two fingered mocha brown head that had great retention and left lots of nice sticky lacing.  Aroma: Roasty coffee, rich dark chocolate and light char with hints of molasses and licorice.  Taste: Roasted malts, molasses and dark fruit plum and raisins to start, followed by rich dark chocolate, roasty coffee, caramel and a light char. Finish is lightly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Rich, velvety, creamy and smooth. Full bodied with moderate to light carbonation.  Overall: A wonderful Imperial Stout from Oskar Blues which is nicely balanced and great to drink.","  rDev 12 oz can poured into a teku glass.  Nice big brownish foam lasting for a while.  Smells chocolate, caramel and coffee, grapefruits.  Taste is incredible. Oskar Blues knows the deal. Flavor of chocolate, coffee and very well balaced. You basically wont even feel the alcohol despite the strong ABV.  Overall, truly a masterpiece. Once again from OB which is and for a long time will be a top notch brewery."]},{"Name":"Abt 12","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/259/1708/","Brewery":"Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV","Style":"Quadrupel (Quad)","Alcohol":10.00,"Score":99.0,"Comments":["  rDev A: slight haze; walnut colored; less than a 1 finger finely pored tan head that receded to a thin collar; very little lacing;  S: sweet and tart; ripe raspberry, dried fruit;  T: follows the nose from start to finish - raspberry is slightly dominant; mild bitterness at the end;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish; very smooth - hides the ABV very well;  O: very enjoyable; dangerously smooth;","  rDev 750 ml bottle poured into a goblet   A- A clear brown with red highlights and small tan head.

Dark brown colour, huge off-white to beige head. Aroma and flavour mainly as the first time, but I drank the beer a little colder now, and the sweetness was not overwhelming. I’m upping it a couple points. Original rating: 330 ml capped bottle. I had trouble getting the very hard cap off (no proper opener at hand), and 1/4 of the beer was driven out by the carbonation before I succeeded. Drank it at temp. appr. 14 degrees C. Beer was murky brown with floaties, large tan head. Aroma was malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates, chocolate and cedarwood. Flavour was again malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates and chocolate. No detectable bitterness.

A bready aroma greets you with hints of stone fruit and booze.  Flavors of brown bread, raisins, dates, and spices explode on the palate and finish cleanly.  Mouth feel is a lighter leaning medium with excellent carbonation.   Overall a clear standard bearer for the style.","  rDev From an 11.2oz bottle, date stamped 04 06 24. Served in a cervoise.  Pours a deep, dark maple-brown with an enormous fat and pouffy head of foam insulation. It takes a good long time to get the whole bottle into the glass and, when I have, I could literally bite chunks out of the head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, foamy cap and gobs of bubbly lacing.  Aroma is warm and inviting. Reminiscent of Grandma’s kitchen, whole grain bread, molasses, cookies and tea.  Taste follows the nose, dense, under-baked whole grain bread, dark and yeasty, molasses and spice, dry wood and old tea bags. Ends with some toasty bitterness on the palate and raisiny, boozy, sweet currant fumes in the sinuses.  Feel is soft and mouth-coating, chewy but no more than medium bodied - the denseness of the palate keeps fooling my brain into thinking it’s thicker than it is and then the very bright carbonation reminds me that it is not.  Bitter and sweet, yum. I was sad when the glass was empty but at 10% abv it’s probably just as well.","  rDev The experience begins with a pour from 25+ oz. brown cork topped bottle into a clear pint glass. A cork stopped beer, so this must be special. The posted 10% ABV is dully noted. It's a beautiful result. The beer is a bright brown with substantial biege head atop. Much less yeasty to the nose than many Belgian Quads. Instead, it's a nice harmony of malts and hops, with a hint of the yeast. Next visual notice is only a little lace follows as the head ebbs. World Class is the appropriate designation for the taste. Remarkably light for its richness and incredibly balanced between the big three; yeast, malt and hops. The alcohol contributes to the taste as well, but only as a typical five percenter, not something double that. If the often overpowering yeastiness of Belgians is offsetting, this is for you. Caveat: Be forewarned, the 10% ABV is for real, for real, regardless of how easy this one goes down.","  rDev St. Bernardus 'Abt 12' @ 10.0% , served from a 330 ml bottle  A-after a very slow pour , dirty brown in the glass with a large tan head leaving a fine spotty lace along the goblet S-dark fruits , Belgian yeast T-amazing , bit on the big side MF-lots of carbonation , big heavy beer , warming Ov-incredible beer prost LampertLand","  rDev 330ml bottle.

Subtly powerful.","  rDev Surprised I hadn't reviewed this one, so I'll do a quick write-up  Pours dark and slightly cloudy out the bottle, dark brown-amber with the faintest amount of lees. Smells delicious, like a big pillowy bed of beer. The taste follows with big chewy malts and earthy hop bitterness. Dangerously drinkable, the alcohol is almost imperceptible, and what alcohol you do notice only adds to the flavor. Meal in a bottle, so malty and chewy and bready  One of the best readily available beers in my area, a go-to. Awesome","  rDev Abt 12  Look: The beer is opaque, deep, dark brown. A beige colored finger of head. A lot of carbonation streaming up the sides of the glass.   Smell: Banana bread, caramel, figs and raisins.

Pours a very rich dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that sticks around a longgggg time before reducing to a cap, minimal lacing  Aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit, vanilla, and nuttiness. Very sweet malty but hefty and rich, very welcoming scent  One of the best examples of a beer matching taste to nose, just incredible. An interesting burnt sugar note that pairs well with dark fruits like plum. Malty sweet in the finish with a nice caramel character  Despite the dark color and bold flavor, this drinks pretty light! Does not drink like 10% at all, finishes super smooth with a perfectly attenuated sweetness  Wow, one of the best quads I've ever had, if not beers in general! Absolutely killer in all aspects, I could drink this again and again, but probably not more than 2 in a night lol","  rDev Dark brown in color with chestnut hues. Poured with a tall, frothy, light beige foam with medium high retention. Aromas of dark fruit, plum, raisin, rich dark malt and hint of chocolate. Medium bodied with assertive, medium high carbonation and mellow boozy warmth. Rich dark maltiness, dark fruit, fig, and raisin followed by a medium, lightly acidic hop bitterness. Dark bready and over-ripe banana flavors on the back end along with light prickly booziness. Finished with sweet dark fruity, banana and mellow dark malt notes. A plethora of rich, malty flavors and fruity esters balanced by light hip bitterness and mellow booziness. Fantastic!","  rDev St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a true liquid bread delight. The pour showcases a dark brownish amber looking body with a healthy stack of khaki foam head. The nose is a bouquet of dark grains, sweetened dried fruit like fig/dates/currants, subtle spices, and fresh well water. The flavors emphasize more of the same with dark malts and dark fruits at the forefront followed by a bit of dark Belgian candi sugar and a nice peppery bitterness to help cut back on all that ABV. In fact the alcohol is incredibly well disguised at the 10% bill making this dangerously delectable. There is a bit of mild spice noted and a finish of rich mineral water. Somewhat tinny at times but never so detracting from the overall balance of this fine brew. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated from the bottle conditioning that lends a frothy micro-bubble action keeping things light and airy on the palate. Really solid stuff, difficult to replicate likely. A beer to be revered over the ages.   The monks of had it right all along...I mean if you are drinking on this Quad everyday, well then life is pretty damn good.","  rDev 12 ounce bottle  dated ? 16 08 22 poured into a goblet. A dark brown reddish in color with a half inch head that has suspension and a lot of carbonation. No lacing. Has a rich aroma of dark fruits like raisins, dates or figs. Even some sourness. Taste is slightly astringent and then sweet. Carbonation is present. Has the dark fruits flavors and some alcohol. Fairly complex. A little tingle on the tongue. Overall a premiere craft beer that is a must try for beer lovers everywhere. An incredible Quadruple that is probably the standard to achieve for quad brewers and there are many great ones out there made right here in the good 'ol USA.","  rDev Date stamped 03 11 22.  Aroma is nice, with your nose into the chalice, but not too strong otherwise. Dark ripe fruits, plums, cherries, sweet-smelling bread. Rich malty aroma.  Look is coffee from the front; mostly clear ruby red with a backlight. 1 inch head, very thick and creamy, light tan, with little retention, with a 1/4 inch long solid lacing following the head down, lengthening as the head recedes. Good level of visible carbonation.  Taste is rich dark fruit, as with the aroma, ripe plums, dark cherries, with a rich, sweet bready-malt backing. They whole taste package is one of gravitas. Slightly bitter in the middle. No obvious alcohol in the taste (or the feel) - well maybe just a little in the aftertaste. The finish is dry, despite the sweet malts initially and in the middle.   The body is moderate with nice carbonation contributing to the overall feel.  A wonderful sipping beer for a relaxing evening.","  rDev Poured from a bottle -root beer brown with big foamy head .

The beer pours bright light brown with ruby highlights and khaki head. Some lacing. The head recedes to a thin cap and persists. The aroma is fruity (cherry, red grapes) at first with dark caramelized sugar drifting in behind. The taste is semisweet cherry with cola, dark sugar and rich malt all popping up before a mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. No trace of alcohol in the taste or aroma. Overall, very good. I'm a little surprised with the fruitiness compared to the malt/dark sugar, but it's still very enjoyable. Now I need to buy more and show some restraint to review nearer the BB date.","  rDev L: Dark cola brew with a three finger sticky dark beige head that dissolves to a cap and a ring that seems to last forever and with some sticky lacing that slowly settles. There are some solids floating around however.  S: Sweet malt, raisins and other dark fruits, with notes of honey, banana, and nutmeg. Great aroma.  T: Follows nose minus the banana and nutmeg and with additional malt and oak. No bitterness outside that tinniness from carbonation. Breadiness is not overwhelming. Booze is hidden from my palate.  F: Thin for my liking and on the high side of carbonated. Sweet but not coating.  O: A mighty fine representation of the style. I would prefer very slightly Stickee Monkee by Firestone but mostly because of it's weight and mouthfeel. This has more balanced sweetness.","  rDev  Best before 3/11/22 ; drank 7/4/19 @ the Yarchives.   Cloudy brown/orange rust appearance.   An even pour yielded a huge khaki head; a thick, frothy curtain of tree-rung lace.   Clove, cinnamon &amp; faint caramel notes in the nose. Smells more like a tripel...   Creamy, medium thick mouthfeel.   Clove &amp; cinnamon flavors up front; mild caramel notes on the finish.   Basically, a darker malt version of a tripel? I'm a quad lover, but this didn't do it for me. Can't say I'll track this down again.","  rDev L: Pours a very dark red brown with a large fluffy tan head and thick creamy fingers of lacing on the glass.

T: Notes of grape, Belgium spice, a slight note of chocolate, some plum, a light mineral note, with a note of cherry and a light bitterness, very awesome beer.  F: Medium creamy smooth carbonation, with a medium to large body.  O: This is a fantastic Belgian ale.","  rDev Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. Caged and corked bottle.  Amber brown colored body. Each pour brings out a voluminous, fizzy head that recedes very quickly. No coverage of lacing. Aroma of banana, raisin, cherry, apricot, green apple, sweet light molasses, sweet bread, and cloves. Taste is sublime and sweet, with toffee, raisin/pear/cherry, banana, sweet malts, tobacco, and cloves/cinnamon.  Medium to full mouth feel. Has alcohol vapors that percolate into the nasal passages. Very good carbonation. Prone to cause burping.  A tremendously tasty, and well put together beer. So easy to drink, even though the higher alcohol % is apparent. Best to drink at the recommended low to mid 50s F.","  rDev Holy moly, this is a beast. L- Huge caramel head, leaves foam clusters down side of glass. Deep chestnut brown. S- Rich pudding-like spicy malt. Citrus notes with hoppiness in the finish. T- Wow! Rich Xmas pudding flavours with a clear tang and vapour of alcohol right on it's heels. F- Rich, alcohol, rounded. O- I'd drink this again as a dessert-beer, as I might a dessert-wine. Nice and slowly savour it. Would go well with hot rich desserts, or cheese+crackers. From notes made circa 2-3 years go, lost, so just added now. BB: 6/6-18","  rDev Bottled on 1/28/15; consumed on 1/9/19  Pours a deep brown with noticeable amber hues and a beautiful crimson sheen when held near light; a large head of tan foam is about as close to perfection as I’ve seen on a beer, and is spectacularly retained; moderate thick, soapy lacing holds briefly where the head does relent. All-around brilliant-looking brew.  Aromas of candied figs, vanilla, plum, and toffee, all rounded with an ultra-balanced malt character; pronounced dark fruits and hints of brown sugar become more prominent on the back end; notes are all pronounced but never overwhelming.  Taste profile shows a great variety of subtle, well-rounded notes including molasses, dark fruits, raisin, plum, caramel, banana, clove, and hints of earthy spice throughout the mid-palate; bubble gum and a slight hoppiness leading through the finish that leaves a faint herbal touch.  Mouthfeel brings a medium body with heavy carbonation integrated to a great benefit on the palate; bits of spice, yeasty, and faint hops influence a uniquely dry kind of stickiness that adds weight but refrains from setting a more cloying, imbalanced tone. This is ultimately smooth, robust, very faintly boozy, and quietly deep on the palate.  A spectacular display of balance, from the depth of flavor and pure execution of aroma to the attention given to each note on the profile; an excellent quad meant to be sipped and savoured easily, with little worry of one aspect interfering with another.","  rDev Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a snifter glass; best by 03/09/21. A: Pours a clear, dark copper to brown color with ruby highlights and very, very lively head formation leaving an initially 3 to 4 inch, fluffy, light brown head, strong retention and solid lacing. S: Tangy/tart. Initial aromas of blueberry (at least some kind of berry), with cocoa and cookie emergent. T: Semisweet with caramel/molasses, raisin, and walnut, as well as a bit of cocoa, tobacco, and lactic acid. Bitterness clearly present, but as a counterpoise to the malts. M: Medium to full bodied with robust and persistent carbonation. Very, very smooth and playful. O: Delicious and fun. Not quite a spiritual experience, but certainly in that direction.","  rDev The colour is dark brown, the liquid clear. The three fingers head is beige and compact, and it sinks slowly to a thick lid without leaving any lacing on the glass.  The smell is strong yet smooth. Brown malts, dried fruits, alcohol, crispbread, matured cheese, roasted nuts and a hint of soap.  The taste is semi-sweet with roasted nuts, dried apples, crispbread, red berries, toffee, banana candy and passing notes of salty crackers and bitter herbs. Full Body. Hot clean alcohol in the aftertaste as well as pumpernickel, treacle, matured Cheddar, ripe bananas and caramel. The long finish is very smooth with digestive biscuits.   The carbonation is strong, the many small bubbles fresh and short-lived. The liquid is smooth but not sticky.  It is way too easy to give high scores to this kind of strong, semi-dark and rewarding beers, and I really try to balance my scores after that knowledge. Still, this is a very, very fine beer.","  rDev Poured from a brown 11.2 oz bottle. Has a cola color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of dark malts and fruits, Taste is dark malts, spices, grapes, alcohol is prevalent throughout. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good beer, but I was expecting so, so much more.","  rDev From notes 11/2/13: Pours a dark and somewhat dull hued ruby brown producing 2 fingers of tan, frothy head that recedes faster than you would think but leaves a nice surface cap and coating of lace. Aroma is Belgian yeast, dark bread, dark caramel, dark fruits, roast and a hint of alcohol. Taste is rich dark bread, dark fruits of all kinds, caramel and molasses, Belgian yeast, pepper, spice and an alcohol note that is heavier than in the nose. Lots of carbonation. Smells and tastes great, full bodied and filling yet highly drinkable for the ABV. Very complex.","  rDev On tap  A- pours a dark brown color with a one-finger creamy off-white head that has great retention and lacing all the way down the glass  S- smells of fruit cake, raisins, fig, spicy yeast and clove  T- dark brown breads, toasted bread crusts &amp; fruitcake, followed by lots of dark fruit; raisin, fig &amp; date. Mid-palate gives a caramel sweetness and spicy yeast that adds hints of clove, banana and phenolic notes. The finish is fruity and peppery with a linger of fruit cake and caramel  M- medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel and a slightly warming finish  O- one of the best quads out there, and a benchmark of the style","  rDev Murky rust brown color. Above medium feel with above average carbonation but it still came off light and fizzy. . Aroma is yeast,dried fruit,plums,yeast,and a grainy fruit cake like smell.  Taste had all the flavors that showed up in the aroma. Dried fruit and plums came through the most but it still was complex and very flavorful. This was a top notch beer that I will certainly visit again","  rDev Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a reddish tint and a large, creamy head. Smells of toasted, bready, caramel malt, chocolate and hints of dark fruit and estery spice, with notes of raisin, fig and clove. Taste is an excellent balance of toasted, caramel malt, chocolate and dark fruits, with notes of raisin and fig, hints of estery spice, with notes of clove and licorice, as well as hints of floral hops as well. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some chocolate, dark fruit and estery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.  While it's actually not quite as good as Westmalle in my personal opinion, this certainly makes for a very enjoyable and well-balanced Quadrupel with rich notes of chocolate, dark fruit and estery spice, although the malts are a little too toasted and the hops a little to floral for my personal taste, while the spiciness and bitterness could be a little more prominent here, with the mouthfeel also being a little flat.","  rDev An absolute classic, and the first beer to get me into Belgians long ago. Everything you'd want a quad to be, with a strong maltiness, raisin, black cherry and fig, floral notes, an effortless complexity that remains accessible to just about any beer drinker.","  rDev L: Hazy, just barely translucent dark reddish brown. Ample carbonation gives a generous foamy tan head, which dies down after a few minutes into a creamy thin film that leaves streaking lacing.  S: Cherry, plum, fig, vanilla, rye bread, mild booze, straw, clove.  T: Big pop of cherry, plum, prune, fig, and raisin upfront, followed by thick, warm, toasted pumpernickel and rye breads. Cherry and other dark fruits float throughout, as well cooked apple and pear. Like apple and cherry pie. Alcohol warmth sneaks in. Finishes shockingly dry with notes of straw, clove, coriander, and pepper.  F: Medium to full-bodied; actually, surprisingly light-feeling--at least medium, but the effervescent carbonation pushes the beer rapidly across the palate like champagne. Finishes bone dry, making it scarily drinkable for 10%.  O: A wonderful beer. World class quad. It's amazing.","  rDev What struck me first is how similar the taste is to a Westvleteren no 12 (which I've had many times). I did not do a side by side test, but I think St. Bernadus Abt 12 is a bit more boozy and prickly than a Westvleteren no 12. In any case this is an outstanding Quadruple. If I do a side-by-side test I'll update.  Look: Cloudy dark brown with a thick fluffy mocca head.  Aroma: raisin bread, figs, very nice aroma  Taste: the flavor is sweet dark raisin bread and dark fruits perhaps figs, it's complex, and there is a soft rum like booziness.  Feel: full bodied, slightly boozy, silky","  rDev L: Dark amber color, two finger beige head, nice lacing, light carbonation.  S: Belgian yeast, oak, alcohol.

This is the quintessential example of the quadruple, by any metric.   But this is not the best example of the quadruple, IMO, and I have said so much in a previous review.   But if you want a baseline for excellence, start here.","  rDev Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Caramel/mahogany brown pour. Massive foamy white head... lasts awhile with thick lacing around the glass. A bit of debris at the bottom of the pour.  S: Rich and sweet. Toasted malts, dark fruit, and candy sugars.  T.F: Dark fruit and sweets. Brown sugar, caramel, baked raisin, and fig. Plum and Belgian candy. Toasted malty goodness... some spice and a whiff of coffee. Smooth and creamy. Medium to heavy bodied... a bit of booze but well hidden.  O: An elite Quad, and as usual those monks don't mess around. A 'must try' at some point in your beer drinking existence.","  rDev Excellent beer. It doesn’t seem to have the flavor characteristics of other quads I have tasted. The spice is there, and sharp finish, bit the subtle esters I’ve tasted in other beers of the style seem to be not pronounced.","  rDev As is the trend with all the Rocheforts, this has a muddle turbid appearance, with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown, under a moderate, less active tan head that's softly convex, settling to a densely blanket that retains well.  Aroma is more subtle and restrained, but also mildly hoppy, while taste follows suit in that it is far more drinkable than 8, despite its slightly stronger ABV. I'm getting notes of sticky toffee pudding with fig and mincemeat via a moderately light but silky body whose carbonation is tingly and fine but expandingly airy, before coming to a semi-dry finish that has a slight prick of numbing heat. A second visit brings a touch of molasses and ginger snaps with hints of caramelized brown sugar, yet it remains slightly bitter by a lightly charred sort of element.  This is a far more balanced brew with a more deft hand and clearly--aside from its strength, which was probably a big deal in its day--this balance is what has kept its reputation so high.","  rDev 11.2oz 330ml   Looks muddy. Smells bready. Good though, like a wonderful raisin bread your momma cooke for ya's. It drinks with a ton of dark fruit and cocoa-y esters blasting your tongue apart like a shotgun. Highly dangerous at 11.3%, it tastes like something better than beer  Complex and dark, while remaining simplistic and light enough so you drink too much and cuss out your loved ones. Highly recommended","  rDev Poured from a bottle -murky and turbid dark brown with short quickly dissipating foamy khaki head leaving a fair amount of frosty lacing. Nose is muted dark stone fruit, mild yeast and sweet malt. Taste follows with a bit more mild sweetness. Finish is smooth and carbonated. An outstanding quad. Dangerously easy to drink.Mighty fine.","  rDev Best by 8/28/23  Wow, what an honor to try this one. Huge shoutout to Julians in Providence for still doing bottles to go during the pandemic   Pours a cloudy dark brown with a finger of khaki head that slowly reduces to a thin ring and leaves no lacing  Straight off the bat I get a nose of sweet molasses and brown sugar, very earthy. Yeast esters give off notes of bubblegum and orange, along with dark fruits like raisins and some hefty malt  In the best possible way, the taste follows the nose. It starts of with molasses and yeasty, slightly spicy in nature, before being smoothed out by super rich malt, chocolate, and dark fruits. Mild funk keeps this even more interesting, just amazing  For being full bodied and pretty sweet, this drinks extremely light. Barely any carbonation, but this still feels so alive. Drinks way easier than the abv  Wow. I’m floored. This was just an incredible brew in every way. Complex, rich, and not even all that filling. This is damn near perfect, bravo","  rDev Older bottle, best by this year, kept cool.","  rDev A burnt chestnut colored beer that hosts that archetypal belgian mountain of foam, khaki colored and stable enough to rise an inch and more over the lip of the glass without dripping a drop.  Smell is a bit muted from my expectations, but I do get a nice candied hazelnut thing overtop of a sort of generic, dark bready, fruit cake.  Taste has a lot more of the rich dark bread character, strong alcohol presence. time and warmth bring forward a bit richer spiced bread character but alcohol definitely dominates. This kind of reminds me of a specialty cocktail Feel is thick and syrupy. No more so than many other big malty styles, but combined with a flavor I'm not loving it makes this one seem a bit like a chore Overall, I'm gonna take the bet that I am just not a fan of the style. Too boozy, too syrupy. Maybe try one with some age on it and see if that mellows things out (this bottle has a bb date of July 2024 so I assume it's close to a year old with a 5 yr bb?) but this wont be one I'll seek out again","  rDev From notes 12/29/11: Pours a dark, cloudy reddish brown. The pour produces a single finger of beige, dense, short-lived head which leaves minimal lacing as it recedes. Aroma is vinous with notes of red grape, dark fruits, bubblegum, brown sugar, alcohol and very mild floral hops. Taste is very complex: dark malt and sugar, clove, banana, figs raisins, dark cherries, honey, molasses and faint chocolate; pepper and alcohol in the finish; alcohol intensifies in the aftertaste. With that let me say that the alcohol is superbly well hidden for an 11.3% ABV beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy and a delight to the mouth. A pure delight.","  rDev 11.2oz bottle bb 11.09.2023 (presumably one year old) poured into Trappist Rochefort chalice at just above fridge temp 11.3% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown in color with a never ending tan colored head building in the center from the nucleated glass. Fairly complete lacing and excellent retention. The aroma is faint with dark fruit and brown sugar. The taste is rich Belgian malt &amp; candi sugar with a not quite tart cherry/dark fruit overtone. The finish is moderately bitter and fairly dry, balancing the initial heavy malt presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. No hint of 11.3% ABV in the taste or aroma. Overall, very good. An absolute classic and absolutely well made, but the taste and aroma are lacking in this bottle. I guess I'll buy a few more and sample as we approach 2023 to see if it's more to my liking.","  rDev Pours and smells like an Egyptian dreaming of a pyramid - like, I’m talking about perfection. Taste though, you know, I want to tell you, but I, I think... And it’s just that; I am lingering on the idea that this is not perfection as I expected. It’s a hell of a beer just like Spielberg has had a hell of a career. That being said, even the best are not without their - not duds - but just kind of good, not great works. And when I sip on this I am content like a kitten drinking milk. Still, I’m not in heaven. Ya feel me?  Life is beautiful. Live it.","  rDev Pours a deep mahogany coloration with a reddish tint and a medium, frothy head, with visible carbonation. Smells of bready, caramel malt and distinct dark fruit, with notes of raisin and plum, as well as some chocolate and estery spice, with hints of clove and allspice. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, with notes of raisin and plum, chocolate, some estery spice, with notes of clove, vanilla and licorice, as well as hints of bitter, herbal hops. Finsihes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some caramel malt, dark fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.  Probably my favorite everyday Quadrupel, only coming in just behind Westvleteren 12, which certainly isn't worth the quintuple price point. What I love about this personally is that it feels a little bit more bitter and spicy than its contemporaries, while also being quite rich, although perhaps just a tad too boozy at the same time. Overall this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quadrupel that's quite hard to beat at its availability and price point. Perhaps a little too boozy, but making up for that with its more bitter and spicy accents, never feeling quite too sweet, as many other examples of the style.","  rDev  Best before November 2023 ; drank 6/17/19 @ the Yarchives.   Opaque brown/orange appearance.  An even pour yielded a nice khaki head; a thick curtain of lace.   Tobacco, clove, cream &amp; black pepper notes in the nose.   Creamy medium thick mouthfeel.   Plum, clove, tobacco &amp; caramel flavors up front; cream &amp; black pepper notes on the finish.   Not much more you could ask of a quad.","  rDev Mahogany with ruby highlights at the ends. Thick off-white mousse with awesome staying power and web-like lace. Absolutely beautiful! Aromas of dried figs, prunes, raisins, dried cherries, a mix of armagnac and calvados. Heady flavors follow the aroma. A bit more fruitcake going on. A touch boozy. Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect from a beer of this ABV.  A dang good nightcap!","  rDev When I first tried this it knocked my socks off. Then... after many brews of different styles I came back to it over and over. Hmm is it that good? Is it original? I've come to conclude that if Quads are not your style try it once. TR#10 is pretty good for style. If quads are your thing also try it once. After that you decide. Repeat years later. I've had so many bad quads that this is refreshing, but it is also not as life-changing as I thought my first time.","  rDev L- I'm not sure if I should have held up to the light. This bottle has rested immobile for two days, and poured carefully but it's poured with clumps of yeast sediment, now floating up and down. Otherwise it's very deep chestnut and cloudy. It poured with a fine 2cm pale tan head, topped with a small dollop of dark brown residue - more sediment. I realise the need to be bottle conditioned to get a beer like this, but just mention it as a caution to others who might wish to rest this really well, and pour reeeally slowly. S- Toasty dark brown mollasses-rich (muscovado) sugar, with liquorish notes from the 11.3%ABV. T- Deep, toffeeish, with some hints of coffee. Wow, it's a deep toasty rich caramel kind of toffee.  F- Rich, deep+dark - think British Xmas pudding with all it's pungent dark fruit, doused with lashings of rum. O- Wow, this is quite something; it's not often I get to sample such impactful beers. Good job it's a small bottle as it's that intense I don't think I'd want nor enjoy more than one at a sitting... ...that said now nearing the bottom, my arm could be twisted... Bought from: Real Ale Limited, 97 Goldborne Road, London W10, for the eye-watering price of £5.90/330ml bottle. And no I hadn't seen the price when I put it in my basket. BB: 11/12/2023","  rDev Dark brown in color with a murky complexion. There's a fingernail of beige around two thirds of the rim and covering about half of the top. The aroma is of dark Belgian candy sugar and sweet, light malt. I'm tasting very sweet light Belgian malt, dark Belgian candy sugar, caramel, and marzipan. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and offers a light warmth from the alcohol.","  rDev Best by (L.21.03.2023) 08:17:06  Murky siena brown color, some floating sediment that settles slowly. Beige head settles on top, and even coatings of lace struggle to hang on to the inside of the glass.  Nose is predominantly malty, with balanced undertones of plum, bread crust, and hints of banana.  Big, bold flavors, just what I wanted and expected from the eldest Rochefort sibling. Again, breadiness throughout with sweet malt, raisin, molasses, and toffee. Boozy character on the tail, with a very mild astringency and musty essence on the back end. Really complex but very well balanced.  Medium-bodied, good carbonation level. Smooth, warming as it goes down. No residual stickiness or mouth coating.   Overall, very reminiscent of that “ideal” Trappist quad. Westy 12 has the edge, but for the much easier accessibility this beer deserves all the praise it receives.","  rDev 330 ml bottle into a goblet. Best by 8/11/21, had 6/13/18.  Pours a dark ruby amber, opaque, with a two inch foamy head on an average pour. Great retention, lots of foamy lacing. Aromas of plums, grapes, malt, dates, figs, some brown sugar, light wine, light peppercorns in the head when warm. The taste is plums, malt, grapes, toffee, dates, some figs and caramel, light wine. Very smooth, creamy, a solid full body, well carbonated.  Great flavor and aroma, terrific mouthfeel, a classic rendition of the style. Well worth a purchase.","  rDev ‘Best before’ date reads 1/31/23, so this was presumably bottled on 1/31/18  Pours a light brown with an overarching sheen of the deepest maroon; a large head of off-white foam expands rapidly and relents sparingly; when it does eventually recede, there is plenty of thicker, soapy lacing left clinging to the glass.  Aromas of stiff malt and light plum upfront, with wisps of yeast, lightly acerbic red wine grape must, hints of buttered banana bread, and smoky toffee building through the rest of the bouquet restrained slightly by minor boozy tones.  Taste bursts with sticky malt character; caramel, dry toffee, unripened banana, toasted wood, dark fruit juice, and unripened plums; plenty of booze sneaks from the mid-palate through to the finish.  Mouthfeel is silky and balanced, with a medium, verging toward heavy body and excellently integrated carbonation; robust, and with a comfortable yeasty weight that’s equal parts delicate, dry, and soothing through the finish.  The depth and complexity this quad begins to show is nothing short of incredible, but at just a few weeks shy of a year in the bottle, it’s a victim of its age; booziness and other indications of too-short a time in the bottle hold this one back just a bit too much. I can’t help but treat this as purely a review for posterity’s sake, because as of right now, this is a solid quad (if not somewhat disordered); in a few years’ time, however, I can’t see this becoming anything but something special, and I sure as hell look forward to that chance to revisit.","  rDev Such a classic benchmark of the quad style. Couldn't believe I had never rated it, even though it has been a while since I've had one from a bottle at home. Marvelous balance of dark stonefruit and caramel, malted sweetness. Just a hint of lemon brightness near the finish.","  rDev Huge foamy light tan head over a dark brown beer that seems like it wants to be burgundy around the edges, nearest light. Smell starts out with fig, morphs into a corn kinda thing with a little heat. Taste is more raisin than fig with a massive bread quality with lingering heat. This is an extremely lively beer, leaving a little alcohol bitterness behind.","  rDev A 330ml bottle, with a best before date of 3rd October 2022. Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Dark brown in colour with an almost two finger tanned head that had decent retention but eventually settled to a nice self replenishing cap while leaving nice curtain like lacing.  Aroma: Strong dark fruits, plum, dates, raisin, black currants, caramel, light roast, toasted bread with a hint of clove and bubblegum.  Taste: Lightly sweet, dark fruits, plum, raisin, dates, fig, black currant, candied sugar, caramel with light banana and clove.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, light syrup, light booze, medium to full bodied with moderate to low carbonation.  Overall: Excellent, just so good. This is easily my favourite Trappist Quadrupel out there. It’s just so balanced, tasty and a joy to drink.","  rDev A - Pours a dark brown with a one finger fizzy tan head.  S - Aroma is rasins, figs and caramel.  T - The taste is brown sugar, caramel, raisins, figs and cherry.  M - Medium body with low carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish.  O - A classic beer. Nice slow sipper.","  rDev One of those beers that makes you wonder why you drink anything other than Belgian!  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Gorgeous beige head atop a murky brown body, great lacing. Fragrant fruity, boozey smell.   I love the way this beer warms! So many flavors come out. Dark fruit, raisin, plums, apples, pears. Almonds, cashews, nutmeg, cinnamon. Warm and comforting. Loved it!","  rDev From a 12oz bottle with a best by date of 13.10.2020. Pours a cloudy, dark reddish-brown with a modest tan head that quickly dissipates. Dark fruit flavors, toasted malt and alcohol on the nose and palate. Very well made, to be sure, but perhaps not my most favorite beer given the high ABV. Best with food, I suspect.","  rDev This is a very well behaved quad. Maybe too much so.   It pours nice and brown with nice fine bubbles. The aroma is a medicinal alcohol plus yeast. The taste is mild but nicely boozy.   This is an anomo!ous Trappist. Boozy, but good because of it, mild and easy sipping.   Highly recommended.","  Poured from a 330ml bottle into glass. Best by date marked on label of '07.02.2022'. Dark, murky body, a little touch of red. Billowy tan head settles to thin ring. Scattered spots of lacing. Aroma of sweet candy and dark fruit. Taste is sweet, and then raisins/figs, complex malts. Truly has an alcohol presence. Medium mouth feel, very smooth. Easy to drink. Very impressive quad.","  rDev Cloudy,muddy,brown color,with just above average carbonation. Aroma is yeast,dried fruit, roasted malt, brown sugar. Taste is identical with the high abv coming through but somewhat hidden. Came off a bit like a dark ale","  rDev From the bottle, it pours mahogany color with a modest head, soon reducing to a partial ring and islands. Huge nose! Candied dark fruit and boozy scent assaults the nose (in a good way)! Caramel malt, candied fruits and a bit of alcohol in the mouth. For some reason, I smelled it and saw a fruitcake in my mind. Feels wonderful in the mouth as well. Wow!","  rDev Dominant impressions of latte coffee with powerful chocolate aromas in the nose. Hints of wood, citrus zest (orange, lemon) and freshly baked biscuits. The initial taste is sweet. Beer and chocolate trapped into one single glass, a liquid milky draught with a backbone of bitter malt. The alcohol warms the throat and, in the finish, you will pick up traces of cloves, citrus, orange and mocha. Top of class."]},{"Name":"Samuel Adams Boston Lager","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35/104/","Brewery":"Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams)","Style":"Lager - Vienna","Alcohol":5.00,"Score":84.0,"Comments":["  rDev Dark copper colored with a quarter inch of beige head on top.

Pours a clear coppery amber color with a smallish head that fades into a thin skin that crawls almost a centimeter up the side of the glass. Fair amount of active carbonation at rest. Smell is lager yeast and grain, mild, simple.  Taste is fairly sweet, slightly nutty and toffee, definite graininess, maybe a slight lemon flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium to thick. Overall, it's not bad.","  rDev In lieu of certain recent news, it was time to support the stalwart and review it. A brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It's a beautiful bright, shiny and somewhat translucent copper-amber. The head was white and just about perfect for the force of the pour. Much of it endures. This time, a refrigerated beer is being reviewed by me. There's a very pleasant malt-hop combination to smell and it likely would be enhanced were the serving closer to room temperature. The taste is malty without being overly sweet and balanced by some earthy hoppiness. The glass lacing completes a very pretty visual. This drinks so much smoother than any adjunct lager it sometimes gets blamed to be among. Taste is a subjective thing, but it astounds that there are advocates that truly believe Budweiser and the others make a superior lager. Perhaps because with a full malt body and an obvious hop finish, this drinks closer to an ale than a lager. There are good ales lighter in body and taste than this. So, if the heaviness here isn't a lager lover's tea party, it's understandable.","  rDev This is just a solid classic. Had a nice tan head, bready malt aroma. Was light, sweet with hints of caramel. There is a good bitterness in the finish. Still a good beer after all these years.","  rDev Yeah, like a frat boy dressed up like a dork, this one is a dandy. And that’s about it.

Lightly hazy orange-amber, with moderate pale tan head.   Smells of light caramel , with faint mixed citrus and spiciness.   Some light floral/fruitiness(halfway? between Pils &amp; helles) , with some of the caramelly malt flavors show through, though less than  regular  SABL, finishing with some noble hop spiciness and touch of the malt . A light drying bitterness lingers awhile after finish. In the grapefruit pith vein, but less noticeably so , than when it is warm.  Feel is light-medium, with slight syrupy slickness, and moderate very fine carbonation bite.   Overall, I'm still on the fence as to which version of SABL I like better, but I do like this. It's just different : a bit hoppier, and less noticeable caramel maltiness. The last few  regular  SABLs I had were draft, with dinner, at restaurants (Remember THAT? ;) ) , so maybe that would tilt it towards this, in a bottle-to-bottle comparison? ???  ps : My initial impression , on the first one (below) . Short version : drink them cold/coldish. [Got side-tracked , &amp; the first one warmed up to 50F? A bit strange .

Nose is malt forward with hints of herbal hops. Taste follows. I did notice slight taste variations after quaffing several, could be a freshness issue. Overall it seems to be a decent lager I would like to try fresh on tap.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a nonic tap glass.  Pours a light amber and crystal clear with an off-white fluffy head that lingers quite well, and leaves some nice lacing. Bubbles stream up from the bottom continuously for quite awhile.

Finishes more sweet than bitter, with a light metallic/medicinal note developing in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation.  This would make for a rather pleasant, if not terribly exciting Lager if it wasn't for that somewhat harsh metallic/medicinal aftertaste, which is not really that bad, but a little unpleasant nonetheless.","  rDev L- On the dark side of amber, and as clear as the glass. Pours with thin white head that reduces to lacing. S- Fresh grains and toasty malts, promising. T- Immediately toasty, and that builds. If blind-folded I certainly wouldn't suggest this could be a lager. I think it tastes more like something between a bitter and pale ale, It's pleasant but not quite what I expected.

The body has a nice copper color with light amber and gold as light passes through. The head is large, white, and rocky.  Aroma: There is a slightly spicy smelling hop aroma with hints of wild flower.  Taste: There isn't a lot of flavor here. It starts out with a bit of alcohol and herbal hops, with a touch of tea-like earthy flavor. The middle is pretty empty. The finish is where this beer really shines. It has this caramel flavor which feels very clean.  Mouthfeel: Wet, easy to drink, light, with a body that sits about 3/4 on the light-to-medium scale. A very faint herbal bitterness in the finish.  Overall: There is nothing interesting or unique about this beer. It rests comfortably at the lower end of Vienna Lagers. It has enough character that is worth drinking but it never tastes especially fresh. I recommend it in a scenario where you can't find a better beer, but overall there are better Vienna Lagers on the market in the U.S.","  rDev Clear gold yellow color, just below medium body and just a little heavy on the carbonation.

Orange and melon. Slight pine.  Clear deep amber color, topped by a tall bubbly head with OK retention, leaving thick lacing down the glass. Great look.  Taste is an interesting combination of the citrus, tropical fruits, and (as a weaker player) pine. The bitterness begins in the aftertaste of the first sip and grows from there with each successive drink. The aftertaste is decidedly resiny and bitter. This influence grows, giving the entire taste a piney, resiny, and bitter dominance after half-way through or so, more than you might expect from the IBU rating. The citrus and tropical fruits remain as a delightful aspect throughout. I really like the taste of this beer overall.  As the beer warms, it develops a malty, slightly sweet undercarriage that balances the bitterness quite well.  Body is moderate for the style, perhaps on the thick side (again, for the style!).  Overall, an excellent American IPA of the West Coast substyle.","  rDev Pours a brilliant, clear, burnished golden color. Thick 3 finger head dissolves leaving ultimately no residual head. Some partial sticky lacing is left behind on the glass as its consumed.   Aroma has notes of pine, maybe some cedar, a touch of grapefruit and a distinct alcohol note coming through.   Taste is interesting ... there is no date on this can (seriously??) so Im not sure if its old, but given this flavor profile, I suspect it is. Taste has notes of pine, pine needles, a slight metallic taste a certain watery character to the flavors. The hops are there and do really punch you in the face, but they seem past their prime. They've taken on a quite bitter, dried out taste. Also, there is a slighty tangy yeast note ... its got that unique Lagunitas yeast - but it seems even more twangy in this one.   Feel is light, really crisp, a bit oily and slick.   Overall, its not great. I do wonder how fresh this can is, but its still got some of the issues that have always kept this from being an IPA that I liked.","  rDev A combination of sessions, both a can poured into a clear pint glass and two off a tap, within hours of each other. The draught is superior and these numbers and observations are combined. The liquid is a light copper with the head and glass lace far better from the tap. Neither has noteworthy bouquet, but what is there is dry hops. There's a pleasant dry hop taste as well, but it's not outstanding. Again, the drawn beer much better than from the can. I know many other beers that come from a can that are better, so I think this will be something I'll only order off the tap.","  rDev 12oz bottle coded 167 0 2 (bottled 11 days ago in Chicago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6.2% ABV. The beer pours very bright golden amber in color with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a ring of lacing. The aroma is caramel malt and pine with a hint of citrus. The taste is semisweet caramel with more pine and citrus, moderately bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. A little hop stickiness remains after each sip, but not sweet or slick. Overall, good. Amazing how tastes change. There is nothing wrong with this beer, but little to get excited about. The taste and aroma are just vague compared to other IPAs.","  rDev 12 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of tight bubbles, leaves good lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and pine aromas, citrus and pine flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass shows a bright yellow gold body and proudly supports a 2in head of fluffy white bubbles, leaving artistic lacing down the length of 3/4 of the glass.

Overall a solid example of the style.","  rDev -clear, amber bottle pour with a generous foam cap and a pine aroma with a tiny hint of mint.

Golden colored ale with a thin film of foam. Clear. Pine, citrus, and berry aromas and flavors with craxker/biscuit malt. Nice grainy balance against the bittering hops. Slightly sticky finish.","  rDev Cracked one of these open here today after getting this up at Gary's in Wayne. I thought I had reviewed it on here but that wasn't the case as apparently, I've never had this before! To me, this is old school compared to what I've had recently and if you're into Sierra Nevada or Stone, then a beer like this would be right up your alley.  This had a bright, coppery pour to it with plenty of head to top it off, although most of the lacing was in the form of a thin ring around the top of my pint glass. Citrus juice, lemon zest, copper, soap suds, and earthy hops filled the muted nose as the taste also contained metallic notes, caramel malt, grass, and melon rind. This wasn't a *bad* beer so much as it felt dated - like something I would have raved about in 2005 except that, things have changed a lot since then. Full-bodied, wide-ranging, and nicely crafted, I enjoyed it for what it was worth which was more of a period piece than anything else.  The booze wasn't terribly high here as it complemented the wide range of flavors without overpowering them. If you're looking for an old-school beer from California that served as a trailblazer for today's IPA's, this would be one to seek out. It had enough going for it but let's face it, much of what's being released today is beyond this and just different - in a good way!","  rDev 12oz bottle - no visible date (opened 7-24-19). 1  pillowy white head, retains well at 1/4 . Deep golden IPA with an abundance of visible carbonation moving through the beer. Clean and clear. Fresh, foamy lacing from the start. Classic grapefruit, pine, and weeds over a slightly sweet malt base. Clean. Lightly doughy malt base and then comes the piney, bitter grapefruit peel, onion, weedy hop attack. Classic. Bright mouthfeel, high carbonation and medium body. Good length on the bitter finish. Very good.","  rDev De Hipercor. En copa Teku. Jugando a Life of a Pixel Classic. IPA suave, no muy amarga, citrica, donde el dulzor de la malta no queda tapado por el lupulo y le da un agradable caracter acaramelado","  rDev Clear orange liquid.

Forgettable.","  rDev Very clear amber color. Around medium carbonation with a slightly thin body. Aroma is grapefruit, citrus peel,a little pine Taste is citrus, some malt, astringent grapefruit, mild bitterness which made this an easy drinking beer","  rDev L - Mid clear amber pours with 5mm white head that's slowly reduces to lacing. S - Subtle hints of perfumed conifer.  T - What you expect of an IPA but balanced by it's richness. It's certainly way away from trying to be a 'fashionable hop-bomb'. F - The richness of the 6.2% comes through loud and clear for me. O -It's well balanced to me. Nothing stands out screaming out of place. And maybe that makes it a 'VGood' beer. It all comes together in that way. I like it, and would buy it again. Bought from a London supermarket, likely M+S Tesco or Waitrose.  Hazy copper with a nice steady head of foam with pretty lacing. Nice smell of light fruits, flowers, pine and malt. Taste follows the nose, although the malt is more prominent here. Taste could have been more intense in my opinion. Medium bodied and quite sparkly. Good IPA, but not one that manages to stand out of the crowd. Reliable choice though.","  rDev From notes 11/31/11: Pours coppery orange with a nice, lasting, white head of foam that leaves good lacing. Aroma is pine and floral with some citrus and grass in a thin caramel and bready malt background. The taste is resinous pine and fruity with a low malt profile. It is hop forward with good hop/malt balance in the middle, it finishes dry and bitter with a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin-medium body with moderate to high carbonation, lively in the mouth.","  rDev Copper with a hint of haze, lots of fast rising carbonation, and 2 fingers of white head.  Smells of skunk, malts, Budweiser, a hint of chilli pepper and fruitiness.  The taste follows the nose, then finishes with a big, dull, bitterness, grapefruit pith, and rust.  Medium body, slightly syrupy, with moderate to high carbonation.  Got at BevMo in Redding, drinking here Aug 18th, 2018. All right beer I hadn't realised until recently I'd never tried.","  rDev Very refreshing, easy-to-drink IPA. Nice amber color with some head and a little lingering lacing. Smells of floral and citrus hops, tastes similar along with caramel, malt and corn. Nice sweet backbone and just a hint of bitterness. Smooth clean mouthfeel, mild amount of carbonation. Very light and crushable!","  rDev 12oz bottle, served in a dimpled beer mug. Pours a slightly cloudy lighter copper body, one finger thick white head, good retention, bits of lacing. Smell is grapefruit and pine, caramel and a bit of toffee, a touch of honey. Light resin. Flavour is mildly resinous, light grapefruit, pine, fairly sweet with a bit of sweet caramel and honey admixture. Mild resinous bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium lighter bodied, good carbonation, slightly slick with a mild resinous bitterness on the backend. Overall, a decent readily available IPA with a good price point. Have ticked this one years ago but finally got around to reviewing it thanks to my dad picking up a six pack when I visited.","  rDev Pours a clear, deep golden amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of caramel malt, grapefruit and orange rind, with a hint of pine. Taste is malt-forward, with pretty little hop character and a certain grainy/earthy quality. Caramel, biscuity malts most noticeable, with mild hoppy notes of grapefruit, orange rind and pine. Crisp and dry, with a medium bitterness in the aftertaste. This the archetype of what I like to refer to as an  old school IPA . Malt-forward, mildly hopped, with certain grainy/earthy notes and dry, piney bitterness. Nicely balanced, but not my cup of tea, as I really prefer stronger hopped brews.","  rDev I don't see a bottle date but the neck of the beer says:  226 ? 2 2238 1133   Appearance: The body of the beer has very good clarity. It is a medium shade of amber with hints of gold. The head is short and white without much retention. Although it only leaves a small ring of foam in the glass it has good lacing.  Aroma: It has a nice combination of grapefruit, spruce, and malt aroma that is moderate in strength.  Taste: It has a nice flavor that tastes a bit like rye grain. There is a clear flavor of grain husk. The beer has a touch of an orange peel rind flavor to it. At times there was a light bit of pine flavor but again it is very soft.  Mouthfeel: It is a very clean tasting beer that is very easy to drink with very good bitterness.  Overall: It is a well made beer that rests in that sweet spot just above average. The beer has some good flavors and aroma but the hops are a bit buried under the grain husk flavor and the aroma isn't very strong. It's not a beer I would buy regularly for my fridge at home but it is one that I am happy to drink at a chain restaurant or another establishment given some of the lesser palatable alternatives. It's worth throwing it in a mix-pack or even grabbing a sixer every once and a while because it will scratch the hop itch.","  rDev A pour from the tap with a small head but ample carbonation. A light golden color. A smooth hoppy aroma. A very nice smooth hop flavor. Maybe just a hint of fruit. Nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall a fine IPA on draft st BJ's Brewhouse.

Practically no aroma, so expectations shouldn't run too high. It tastes like a hoppier version of a standard mass produced lager.

I have drunk this beer on a few occasions, learning this, I am rectifying the situation. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a pint glass. The pour of the beer produced a massive two-fingered head. Excellent head retention. The bright foam is airy and billowy. As the foam dissipated, it is leaving lots of lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 4, pale straw yellow with amber hues. This beer is cloudless with a few carbonation bubbles. This IPA is a beautiful looking beer.   The initial aromas in the beer are grapefruit, resin, pine, toasted malts, and a hint of mangos. Nosing further in the glass, I smell biscuits, bread crust, earthiness, oranges, fruity esters, and a touch of herbal.   The flavors in the beer are wheat, fresh-cut grass, grapefruit, lemons, oranges, fruity esters, herbal, mangos, pineapple, pine, resin, biscuits, bread crust, and bright floral bouquet.   The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.   The body of the beer is medium, medium-low carbonation, and a medium-plus finish.   This IPA is bursting with grapefruit, floral, and wheat. The balance in the beer is impeccable. A solid example of an IPA, I quickly finished this beer, wanting another.","  rDev Bottle. Clear golden color. White head with lace.  Nice west coast ipa.

I've had hundreds of beers over the years. I cannot believe I've never tried this one.  Pours a slightly hazy gold with a white foamy two-finger head. It settles to a nice skein of foam, with decent lacing.   The malt is very present, with barley and wheat showing up with both grainy and crackery notes. White pepper. White grape. Orange and grapefruit notes. Hops present, mostly in pine/resin fashion, but balanced. Grass and booze notes in the background. Hoppy for the style, but not quite IPA.  The flavor straddles the line between APA and IPA, with the fruit/malt presence keeping it  home.  Orange, grapefruit, white grape, white pepper (wheat), biscuit, caramel, and booze notes. A little bit of soapy/sourness comes out as the brew warms, but not offputting. The hops are less present on the palate than they were on the nose, but still provide more bitterness than is typical for the style.  The body is just barely medium, and very drinkable, with less carbonation than I expected. In fact, this might be the most disappointing aspect of the brew. Creamier than other Lagunitas offerings, and the booze and hops provide a nice, but not bracing, finish.   Overall, this is a not-atypical Lagunitas take on a common style--a little boozier and a little hoppier than the norm--but still tasty, regardless of which  box  you want to put it in, thanks to a solid malt spine.","  rDev From notes 10/31/11: Pours gold with an off-white, 1.5 inch white head that leaves thin lace. Aroma is hoppy backed by malt with faint alcohol. Nice balance of malt sweetness and hop flavor and bitterness. Starts sweet, finishes bittersweet with a bitter aftertaste.","  rDev Pours a slightly foggy straw color with two fingers of white, foamy head. Aroma is straw, orange peel, yeast with bread, biscuit, and pale malts. It smells clean. Flavor profile is wheat, straw, orange peel, and a light yeast finish that comes with a little dry rye spice. There is bread, biscuit and pale malts. Mouth feel is slightly effervescent, which mingles well with a light grainy texture to keep this beer drinking smooth and session-able, and yet with a palpable, soothing texture. Overall, a great, straightforward wheat beer that remains well constrained, while still providing a tasty beverage.

Label states that the beer has some wheat besides some barley, but coloration isn't that much opaque.  Poured into a Anchor Brewing tumbler glass.  A: The body is yellow and crystalline having no opaqueness at all. Head is white, it's not massive at all, being just a bit weak but creates some lacing. S: The aroma is just slightly hoppy and citric having some clove in the back, which led me to believe that this beer is an American Wheat Pale Ale. I got to RateBeer and seen that it was an IPA but when I got to BeerAdvocate and Untappd, I could confirm that it is in fact an AWPA. Good stuff. T: Taste isn't incredible as it is just a little bit bland and empty, having very minimal profiles of citrus. On top, some clove incoming from the wheat and also more sweetness are both present in the beginning of the taste. In the end, the taste's a lot more empty having a finish similar to a lager almost, being only composed with corn-like sweetness and just a small hint of bitterness incoming from the soft hops. M: Body is low. Carbonation is medium to low. Alcohol is unnoticed though running at 7.5% ABV. Sweetness is medium and bitterness is medium to low. O: Not a bad American Wheat Pale Ale but could use a lot more flavour.","  rDev lightly veiled orange color. Average white foam. In the smell citrus hop, tangerine, grapefruit, orange marmelade.

Citrus aftertaste, with a good bitterness.","  rDev Pours a clear, deep golden coloration with a medium, foamy head. Smells of biscuity malt and citrus fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, lime. Taste is a nice balance of biscuity malt and citrus hops, with notes of grapefruit, tangerine and lime. Finishes with a nice, medium dry bitterness. I'm not really getting any wheat/yeast character from this at all, seems more like a strong Pale Ale to me. A pretty nice one at that though, no discernible boozyness to this at all. I liked this a LOT more than their IPA, with a stronger hop presence and great malt balance.","  rDev A little sumpin ale pours a copper color with a small and long lasting head. Hippy aroma with hints of sweetness. Hoppy yet sweet flavor. Good body and feel. Overall not bad hoppy wheat beer.","  rDev A good wheat pale. On the IPA side more with the present hoppiness.

S: Not a very strong aroma, a little wheat and grain, some perfumey floral hops, but I don't get much besides that.  T: Sweet malt, and a little sweet fruit, that is balanced out by a strong piney and floral bitterness.  F: Medium to fuller body and creamy smooth carbonation  O: While the aroma isn't very strong, this beer reminds me a lot more of an IPA than a wheat beer.","  rDev This is a very enjoyable and complex beer and in no way did it remind me of any wheat beer I've ever had. Lots of sweet malts and a nice hop kick make you enjoy every single delicious sip.","  rDev Nice golden color,medium carbonation. Really enjoyable beer that stays in the middle of the road but I mean that as a compliment.

The frothy 2 finger head lasts for the whole glass and drapes it in foam. Delicate orange, lemon, floral notes in the nose. The taste is hoppy with a distinct orange character. Grapefruit and some aspirin in the back. A bit of tart, clean wheat maltiness provides some balance. The mouthfeel is light bodied with smooth moderate carbonation. The finish is moderately bitter and abundantly fruity.   This is a fantastic American Pale Wheat. Super hoppy and boozy for the style, but complex and delicious.

Smell: sweet and a bit estery, with a lightly biscuity malt component. It's ok, but it comes off as kind of having a cloying fruity sweetness. Not super strong, but definitely there.

I feel like it has changed not one iota.

This observation by virtue of two twelve ounce brown bottles being poured into a clear glass liter mug. The white head is modest, yet enduring as part of a well carbonated brew. Yeast dominates the hops and malt in the smell. The good news is that there's more to taste than smell. This is a well balanced and somewhat complex ale. The barley malt is solid and provides a little sweetness. Within its relationship with the hops, they bring some earthiness which adds to the depth. Apparently, the malt, hops and yeast can also produce a nutty aspect for the taste buds to appreciate. Concluding, there's only a little lace following the liquid down the glass. No matter, this is a very pleasantly full flavored amber ale which makes it good that it's available year round.","  rDev 12 oz can  Pours clear amber orange with a creamy off-white light khaki colored foam head.

Overall a real nice amber ale.","  rDev 355 ml can as New Belgium Fat Tire Belgian Style Ale, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 5.2%. Orange to amber colour, large head, slightly off-white. Moderate malty aroma, a hint of caramel. Malty and relatively bland flavour, some caramel again, a slight fruitiness, minimal hops. Not bad, but far from exciting - and there is nothing  Belgian  about it.","  rDev Look: IT pours clear amber with an off white head. Head retention is good.  Smell: It medium low levels of caramel and pine.   Taste: The caramel is a bit stronger in the flavors with some pine and a bit of floral.  Feel: It has a medium body with a moderately bitter aftertaste.  Overall: It is a pleasant drinking amber ale.","  rDev Appears clear amber with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly. Smells bready, floral and lightly fruity. Taste follows the nose. Mouth feel is medium for the style with good carbonation. Overall a nice example from New Belgium that I am sure I would order again.","  rDev -Clear amber bottle pour with a thin, tan foam cap and a faint sweet-malt aroma. The flavor includes caramel, biscuit malt and and some woody hop bitterness. I have enjoyed many of these over many years. It is consistently flavorful.","  rDev Im not generally a big fan of ambers or reds, but this fairly well done. Not too sweet, good malt/hop balance. Quite drinkable. The only weird thing about it is that there's no after. Nothing lingers. The beer just abruptly ends on your palate. Nice build up, though. Work a try.","  rDev This rating is for the Canadian version brewed by Steam Whistle. As the name suggests, this brew pours a deep amber colour. The taste is sweet and malty, with hints of caramel. Not too much hops here. Feels smooth and silky going down. A very good beer.  July 16 2020","  rDev On tap @ Bent Elbow...I'm told this was contract brewed by Steam Whistle Toronto....tapped a lightly hazed light coppercolor with a 2 finger cap...nose was soft with some light toasty notes and a subtle grassyness...flavor was malt forward with toasty malty discernment then became balance more in the finish with a musty bittering...super well rounded brew...extremely mellow and smooth...easy patio quencher","  rDev I have drinking this craft beer classic for a very long time, so imagine my surprise when I realized I never reviewed it! Long over due:  Pours out a clear Amber with golden highlights. A soft and subtle white foam forms high, settles down fast but leaves plenty of coverage and a bit of sticky lace.  The nose had aroma's reminiscent of an English pale ale and Belgian Amber. Exactly how the description states, sweet and toasty style malt, buttery, honey scented with some subtle spice from the yeast. The hops are very subtle in the nose but give off some pine and cedar style effects.   A medium body, crispy and then long and slick malty feel gives this a bit of extra hefty, but deep down it's pretty crispy.  A combo of slightly spicy Belgian-inspired yeast with the honey-soaked bready effect of the malt makes for a very unique amber ale. A little, Belgian, a little English in all the ingredients and American in overall style. Malt and spicy yeast with a subtle hop taste of pine and grasses rounds out the flavor spectrum.  Overall, it's a classic. Unique and fun. Not mind blowingly complex but a nice choice if your in a pinch.","  rDev Rich amber color in a tulip glass, clear as glass, with finger or two of off-white foam... Something of an amalgam between an English bitter and an American amber, only vaguely suggestive of Belgian ales... And that said, I've had much better bitters and ambers and Belgians than this... Herbal and floral, with some light shellac and a bit of muted, deep citrus; smooth and rather flat-feeling... Not particularly bitter, but did have a mild coating feeling to it; and maybe mild-to-moderately sweet... A decent enough drink, but nothing that makes me want another...","  rDev From notes 9/6/14: Pours a clear medium amber producing a huge 3+ finger, off-white somewhat lasting, frothy head that leaves a nice coating of chunky, spider webby lace. Aroma is fronted by toast and biscuit malts with hints of caramel and cocoa, faint honey, fruity and floral hops. Taste is toasted bread/biscuit malts, honey and caramel with a hint of roast. Hops fruity and floral are otherwise mostly in the bitter finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation. This brew pairs well with many foods.","  rDev Very nice, easy to drink ale. Nice golden color, some white head with small amount of lingering lacing. Smells faintly of fruit and malt. Tastes of malt, caramel, sweet fruit and a little biscuit. Moderate carbonation throughout, no bitter aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel. Really easy to drink and enjoy.","  rDev Had this on 2018-05-12 on a Southwest flight from a 12 oz can.  A- Amber with a 1-finger white head and nice lace.   S - Lightly toasted white bread, mild caramel and honey  T - Toast with apple butter and cinnamon. Nice amount of balancing bitterness. Somewhat like a Vienna Lager.  M - Medium body and light-mediun carbonation. Creamy.   O - Quite flavorful. Better than I remembered from Lake Tahoe. Will have this again.","  rDev 12oz bottle served cold into a pint glass. One of the last reminders of a shopping trip a little while ago. Enjoy by May 20, 2018.  Appearance - pours a very clear, amber coloured beer with a modest amount of bubbles and a big creamy cap over a finger in height. Pretty good retention and the lacing left behind is an interwoven spiderweb.  Smell - clean and grainy, with some grassy aromas, a hint of leafy hops and a subtle nuttiness. Mineral notes on the nose too.  Taste - mild, very mild with some grainy bits and the slightest suggestion of Belgian style yeast and candi sugar. Could use a little more punch.  Mouthfeel - easy drinking, middling carbonation and moderate finish.  Overall - a solid example of the style with a slightly Belgian twist. Worth a try.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb 6/17/18 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 5.2% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber in color with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is a bit of bread and yeast. The taste is cracker like, slightly toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness and an almost imperceptible tart on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, very good. Not my particular style of red ale, but it's really well made.","  rDev Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, medium amber/copper color with lots of little streams of bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface.

Good lacing. Aromas of somewhat toasted, biscuity malts with some caramel sweetness and also a hint of brown sugar. the taste is pretty much the same, with a heavy, somewhat toasted, biscuity, caramel malt sweetness with a hint of brown sugar followed by some earthy, piney hop notes that lend some bitterness. The sweet malt flavors certainly dominate the flavor profile, but the balance from the hops is well implemented here. Has a crisp, yet smooth and somewhat frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a sweet aftertaste that lingers on the palate nicely. A very nice beer here all around.   Eric","  rDev A - Pours a clear amber with a two finger foamy off white head. Light soapy lacing.  S - Aroma is caramel and toasted malts.

A nice easy drinker.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours a clear deep amber with a thick off white head that leaves lots of lace. Nose is light toffee and grain with some light fruit. Lightly sweet honey with very light roast. Slightly thin creamy mouth with average carbonation and a crisp finish.","  rDev From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter via a friend from work--Thanks Kevin This one time highly sought after amber ale pours a nice clear glowing  amber with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin  pooling layer, and showcases nice light lacing. Nose of toasted caramel malts and a hint of hops. Flavors follow but present themselves well with  toasted malts and light zesty hops that are balanced and well presented. Nice mouth feel; medium high carbonation is quenching and lively, medium light body, and a sweet hop tinged finish.  Overall, a solid ale from a very good brewery. While more macro than micro it is still pleasant to enjoy. Nothing to hate, more to like.  Cheers","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pale amber color. Short lived head with decent lacing. Subdued smell - maybe a bit banana? Taste is a bit watery and malty. Ok.","  rDev Amber color,medium carbonation with a decent feel.

There isn't much of a head. It has a short creamy-textured film with sparse bubbles but nothing serious. It is noticeably uninspiring visually-wise; the lack of a substantial head, even when forced from the bottle pour, is disappointing.  Aroma: It smells of clove and old cardboard with a note of burnt pizza crust.  Taste: Under-ripe banana comes through at first and it's really bright tasting. The middle of the palate is a mellow banana flavor and a faint cream of wheat flavor. It's pleasant but very mellow. It invokes memories of sliced bananas over shredded wheat cereal. It has a very nice, clean, precisely flavored finish which consists of green bananas and wheat cereal.  Mouthfeel: It is well carbonated and light bodied. It is easy to drink. No real bitterness.  Overall: An uncomplicated beer with a nice banana flavor with a note of cereal wheat. As an import beer this is alright and it's worth drinking from time to time. It has some very intriguing and unique banana flavors, however it lacks complexity. I could drink it again but I would likely hesitate at a bottle over a keg pour. I would love to try it fresher than an import bottle.","  rDev Mildly cloudy, light amber body; gentle, slow-rising carbonation; very thick, dense and creamy head, white. Prominent scent of fresh banana; dull sweetness. Rich, full flavor of banana and cloves; biscuit-like malt; very mild bitterness. Full, rounded mouthfeel, heavy body; chewy and velvety on the palate.  This beer certainly reminds me of the hefeweisens I enjoyed in Germany.

I love a good hefe, so I have pretty high expectations for this one, not to mention it's currently sitting at #239 of all time on this site  Pours a cloudy yellow gold with a massive 3 fingers of white pillowy head that slowly fades to a single finger, leaving plenty of lacing behind  All the classic hefe notes are present, check. There's charming simplicity to the aroma of overripe banana, mildly spicy pepper, light bubblegum, and doughy malt with a hint of honey sweetness  The front end of this starts with some tingly clove spice with a soft wheat backbone to support it. On the swallow, the banana comes to life, with more soft wheat and a lightly crisp malt rounding it out  The feel here is very nice, a medium body combined with mild carbonation leads to a very refreshing beer, perfect for this unseasonably warm day here. A bit sticky on the finish, but nothing overbearing  Wow, this was an incredible beer. It's wild to think how something this simple can stand up to any heavily adjuncted stout, dry hopped NEIPA, etc. Everyone should try this one, and I plan on getting more of it very soon","  rDev Can't believe I have not ever reviewed this beer here before, as this has long been one of my favorites. Poured out of an 11.2 oz bottle into one of my weizen glasses, this beer pours a pretty cloudy, hazy, medium golden color with lots of stream of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a white head that's well over an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a good, thick surface coating along with a thick ring lining the inside of the glass and excellent lacing. Aromas of wheat, bready malts, hints of bubble gum, banana, and clove. Hits all the marks aroma wise for a a beer of this style. The flavor follows suit very nicely indeed with the aforementioned wheat, bready malts, hints of bubble gum, banana, and clove all excellently present and very well balanced. Just magnificent! Very little hop presence, just a very slight herbal, grassy hop note that is quite subtle. Has a crisp also smooth, light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish. I've had this beer many times over the years, and it is one I always keep going back to, as it is is really a standard bearer for this style, being that it is brewed by the world's oldest and continually operating brewery!   Eric","  rDev 500mL bottle, served in my very old UFO Hefeweizen glass. Cloudy brass in color with loads of white pillowy foam. Phenol aroma of clove. That spice flavor carries straight through to the flavor. Noble hop bitterness is present only enough to keep grain in check. Yeast character dominates over wheat, and provides a citrusy edge. But overall this is an extremely classic German hefeweiss and it deserves outstanding ratings. Is it better than Franziskaner? Probably not to my taste.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a clear yellow amber color with a big two finger head of puffy white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a decent sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is very strong of a wheaty smell mixed with other big aromas of a light banana smell and a decent showing of come clove and coriander. Along with these smells comes a bit of a grassy smell as well as a touch of a musty and hay smell. Taste – The taste begins with a wheat bread taste mixed with some sweeter tastes of a ripe banana nature as well as a bit of caramel. There is very light yeasty taste throughout as well that is nicely complimented with a decent hit of clove. As the tastes advances from the initial some orange and a little bit of hay work their way onto the tongue. At the very end the hay and banana increase in intensity and a joined a bit of graininess to leave one with a sweeter and sorta fruity, nice wheaty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the blend of flavors the feel is quite nice and makes for a very easy sipping brew that accentuates the wheat, banana, and spice quite well. Overall – A well crafted hefe. It has a nice blend of wheat, sweet, spice, and hay. An enjoyable drinker.","  rDev August 25 2019","  rDev Ooo. Expanding my horizons here. I’ve tried a good few hefe’s Of the American variety so was happy to find this highly rated Bavarian style, from the world’s oldest brewery no less (they must be doing something right by now!). Look and smell were enjoyable but the taste is heavy - almost oily, this lends itself to a nice full mouthfeel, but I prefer brighter/cleaner/crisper to date.","  rDev An absolutey superb beer, and one of my favourites. I lived in Berlin for 3 years and this was considered an expensive beer at the beer shop, about euro1.50/500ml. One of my favourite German beers... until I tried Weihenstephaner Vitus which continues to further knock me for six+ (in my Top-10 of 400+ beers). Still, Vitus is something truly special, meanwhile this one makes a wonderful superb weekly treat.  This time enjoyed at the much more expensive Brauhaus in Singapore. S$16 for a 500ml bottle.","  rDev L: Pours a slightly cloudy yellow gold color with a very large creamy white head that dissipates rather slowly and just a bit of lacing on the glass.  S: Cloves, banana, a hint of pepper, and wheat and baked bread all mix together to create a very inviting aroma.  T: Clove, pepper, banana, and baked wheat bread all mix together to make a smooth and easy drinking beer, a slight bitterness.  F: Goody body and smooth creamy carbonation.

Taste follows the nose, with a yeasty, wheaty character accompanied by bready malts, banana and a little citrus, with some spicey notes of cloves and a little pepper and bitterness in the aftertaste. An exceptionally well-balanced beer where yeastiness, spiceyness and fruitiness are in perfect balance.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a hazy amber with a really robust, thick, head. In the nose, you get banana, yeast and bread. In the mouth, the same, lots of banana, but not overwhelmingly so, to carry you into the bready malt, followed by clove. Yum!","  rDev L: Hazy golden orange capped by an enormous creamy, pillowy white head. Nearly perfect retention, with gobs of sticky lacing.  S: Yellow banana, orange peel, green apple, pear, white bread, honey, vanilla, straw, and clove.  T: Sweet banana like Runts banana candy, complimented by orange zest and more subtle orchard fruits such as red and green apple and pear. The malt backbone correlated with the mouthfeel, being more of a pillowy, doughy sensation than an actual taste, with a dab of that aforementioned honey and vanilla. Upon further drinking, I even notice notes of honeydew melon and green grape. On the back end, the ripe banana/apple/pear/orange sweetness transitions into a light dryness with notes of straw, coriander and clove, giving way to a refreshing clean finish.  F: A little thin than expected given the appearance, but still great. Soft and smooth and gently creamy, a bit thin in the middle, but with a nice moderate carbonation that makes it thirst-quenching and refreshing.  O: Does a traditional hefeweizen get any better than this? Leave it to the Germans to invite AND perfect this tasty style. Truly a world-class beer.","  rDev I’ve had Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier many times and I just had it again. I think it is a great Hefeweizen. I love it for its balanced and moderate but distinct flavors and for being such a classic Hefewezien and yet such a great beer.  Look: golden hazy hue with very thick (three-inch) white foamy head.  Aroma: The aroma is wheat, yeast, banana and maybe a tad citrus.  Taste: the usual Hefeweizen flavors wheat, yeast, banana, a little bit cloves and maybe a hint of orange but the flavors are just really well composed and well balanced.

There's gold and copper hues to its amber color and the modest white head is soft and enduring. It would take significant searching to find a better looking beer. The aroma is less impressive, with only mild glimpses of malt and hops, then just a little yeast. Although not particularly malty, nor overly hoppy, this is one fine tasting brew. The limited sweet presence of malt is of no concern, because the body is supple and the hops aren't overly bitter. The balance in taste between the malt and hops, milder than some in the category they may be, is flawless. The glass lacing acts as a witness to the quality of this beer.

This beer pours a slightly hazy, medium apricot orange colour, with four fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly ecru head, which leaves some decent flock of seagulls pattern lace around the glass as it lazily abates.  It smells of gritty and grainy caramel malt, muddled domestic citrus rind, a further bit of sugary tropical fruitiness, some damp minerality, and plain earthy, musty, and leafy green hop bitters. The taste is crackery and biscuity caramel malt, some orange, lemon, and grapefruit citrus pith, a hard water flintiness, meek exotic candy notes, and more leafy, weedy, and grassy verdant hoppiness.  The carbonation is average in its palate-coddling frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, with nothing really making a fuss at this particular juncture. It finishes trending dry, the malt sort of faltering, in the face of a sturdy lingering hoppy quotient.  Overall - I can see why this has been considered a stalwart in the craft IPA segment for so long. Frooty, not too bitter before it was 'cool', and with a 15-proof alcohol measure that exhibits its Southern, rather than Panhandle, manners to the utmost, y'hear?","  rDev Poured into a narrow pint glass: color is copper, a bit murky/dense looking, big 2 finger head with a very light tan color, small frothy bubbles, head laces the glass and lingers with solid top.   Smell is primarily earthy, herbal hops, light citrus rind, light caramel.  Taste is similar with an earthy herbal hop dominance, lighter citrus and pine, malt is notable with caramel and very light toffee; I've tasted some oak like qualities in this before but not much present in this vintage. This appears to have aging to the hop and malt character as it does not seem uber fresh, but I like the English style tilt with a moderate malt backbone.   Mouthfeel is quite crisp and bitter, a good balance as the malt sweetness starts to come through and linger a bit.

Hops have faded some, but still assertive bitterness. Plenty of pine resin and heavy malty body in behind. Not that you can taste the ABV, but there's no secret that this is a bigger than standard IPA.  Mouthfeel - A little thicker than many IPA's this is approaching DIPA territory with a fuller feel and ABV. Carbonation is crisp and assertive the finish is quite dry.  Overall - A very enjoyable tipple and certainly a beer I will review if (and or when) I get a fresher can as I think I'm missing a little bit of the juicy aspect of this beer as well. As it is a really damn good IPA, even if it's a couple months past its optimal drinking point.","  rDev Can- poured a deep burnished lightly hazed gold with a large off-white meringue cap lasts and laces the glass....aromas of mango, pine and citrus, rich pale malt undertones... malty, fruity and bitter in balance up front.....goes bitter and dry in the finish...rich satisfying flavorful IPA","  rDev Clear rose gold with three fingers of bone color head. Rings and swathes of lace form as the head slowly recedes. Smell floral citrus fruity hops light pine and bready malt. Taste is pine pink grapefruit orange zest with good bready malt support. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. The finish is dry and medium bitter. Overall a delicious IPA. Canned 08/16/19. First time I have seen this in my area. $10.49 for the six pack of cans.","  rDev Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine, three finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus hops, orange, grapefruit and mild mixed stone fruit. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, tangerine, light grapefruit, pine needles and mild mixed tropical fruit. Lingering, resinous pine and citrus hop finish with fleeting bright fruit esters. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A classically profiled IPA with a caramel base and nice citrus and pine hop bill, leaning heavily towards citrus, particularly orange flavors. Somewhat underwhelming at first, good herbal hop flavors develop with appealing fruit esters and suggestions of pine in the finish. Nicely done and welcome; traditional IPAs are still my preferred style.","  rDev Aroma is a classic American IPA citrus aroma. The only criticism is it is a bit subdued.  Tall white head from a vigorous pour fades a bit faster than leisurely. Creamy and cratered surface of the head as it recedes, leaving spotty, disconnected lacing. Hazy dark copper-amber color. Moderate visible carbonation.  Mouth feel is medium initially transitioning to fairly thin.  Taste is citrus with a fairly strong bitterness right away. No pine, but nicely bitter. The malts are there, earthy and grainy, but the hops are the star, as expected with an AIPA. Both the citrus flavor and bitter hops sustain throughout to a crisply bitter aftertaste lingering on the tongue until your next drink. Finish is a little toward the sweet side from dry. Let me explain: I wouldn't describe it as sweet, but it is nudged to that side of the scale from dry.  A classic American IPA. Not the puckering West Coast style, but the classic American style. Very well done.","  rDev Jai Alai IPA brewed by Cigar City Brewing, with an ABV of 7.50% This American IPA pours out of a 12oz can into a pint beer. The color of this brew is a deep hazy golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness mixed with earthy grains and malts. So far this is a solid well put together American IPA. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on a milder than normal hop bitterness mixed with nice smooth earthy grains and malts. The body of Jai Alai IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this American IPA, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.50% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. This brew would go nice with dinner or cooler summer day. Just smooth easy drinking brew. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Jai Alai IPA a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Cigar City Brewing, did a super nice job with this American IPA.","  rDev Outstanding ipa. Very well balanced and full of flavor. Smells of malt, pine and citrus. Taste follows the smell. The mouth feel is full bodied with a little bite. Just a great beer","  rDev Jai Alai pours a cloudy bronze color, with a very small head. Citrus aroma, dry. Taste is full of citrus, dry body, with a hoppy finish. Good body and feel. Overall, very drinkable, yet full bodied IPA.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned 04/19/19, code PITTER PATTER. A: Pours a hazy, orange-amber color with a one finger, orange-wheat head, solid retention, and gorgeous rings of Belgian lacing around the glass. S: Aromas of caramel, pink grapefruit, and pine. T: Remarkably dry with palate following nose, although a bit overwhelmed by cumin like bitterness. M: Light to medium bodied with robust carbonation. Oddly juicy given the flavor pallet. O: Solidly made, I suspect resembling an English IPA before it made the trek to India. Would definitely have it again.","  rDev Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a deep golden amber color with a one finger head of thick white foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a tropical fruit and bready smell mixed with some other aromas of caramel and pine. Overall the aromas produce a big sweet smell that entices the nose. Taste – The taste begins with a all those tropical fruit flavors that were picked up in the nose. At the start there is tangerine, mango, and papaya mixed with a slightly doughy and caramel sweet taste. Upfront there is also a decent hit of citrus hop which grows stronger as the taste advances. Later in the flavor some pine and a little bit of a honey like sweetness come to the tongue and leave one with a sweet, fruity, and nicely hopped taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is a little bit more chewy with a carbonation level that is average. For the mix of sweet fruit and hop the feel is really nice and creates a wonderful media for all the rich flavors to be sensed. Overall- A quite tasty and flavorful IPA. Certainly one to try if you get the opportunity.","  rDev Canned 6/2/15; drank 6/12/15 @ the Yarchives.   Drank straight from the can; no visual cues.   Orange citrus, sweet mango &amp; mild grapefruit notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Orange citrus, mango &amp; mild grapefruit flavors up front; mild grapefruit bite on the finish, but not too bitter.   A very sessionable, fruit forward IPA in the vein of Bell's Two Hearted. Nice!","  rDev A well crafted easy drinker. Of the best of the West Coast Style!","  rDev Can at Las Buenas Pulgas. Pours a clear golden colour, medium head and retention, good lacing. Aroma of resins, oranges, peaches, caramel. Medium body, oily texture, good carbonation. Bitter dry finish. Taste of oranges, resins, caramel, fruits. Good one.","  rDev Canned on 3/25/19  Pours a deep, primarily clear copper orange topped with multiple fingers of thick, rocky, fluffy white head; excellent retention eventually recedes to big gobs of soapy lacing smattered around the glass and a large collar. Impressive.  Aroma is a clean balance of caramel malts with a slight backing of mineral tones, raw herbal hoppiness, and a bit of honeyed clementine and dank citrus; soft but pretty detailed, it comes together nicely.  Taste profile comes out strong with some orange and earthy citrus backed by smooth caramel malt; mid-palate fades to bitter clementine zest and hoppy herbal tones, with tons of juicy tropical backbone that sits easily in a more passive role.  Mouthfeel is lighter-bodied and bolstered by a fluffy, almost airy carbonation; incredibly crisp with a juicy flow that takes off before giving way to a lasting, well-balanced bitterness. Finish is almost surprisingly clean, rounding out the palate excellently and lifting the approachability to the next level.  Beer with equal parts impact and drinkability; dangerously sessionable balance of hoppy bitterness and juicy, dank tropical fruit. A straightforward, old-school IPA that just delivers simply but effectively.","  rDev From a can dated 2/26/19  Translucent medium amber , with 1 finger of off-white head, that leaves a ring and 1/2  of lacing.  Smell is tangerine, pine , a faint, undefined mix of other fruit, a little honey-and-golden-bread sweetness. (Think toasted corn muffin, topped with honey.)  Taste is tangerine rind, grapefruit pith, pine, a touchof carmel, and bread crust. Substantial , tongue-lashing bitterness throughout, that lingers for awhile. (That's a positive thing. ;) )   Feel is medium, with fine , sharp carbonation, that , with the bitterness, impales the tongue, in a pleasant way.  Overall, just a pleasure. Always a must-have, anytime I can find it at a reasonable age . (less than 3 months?) What is it? It straddles genres. It's ...Jai Alai ! Just know that it IS good. :)","  rDev Glad to see a reputable brewery from Florida available in NH. 12 oz. Canned on 2/18/19 opened on March 16 19.  Can you dig it?   A totally clear golden-amber color. Dense off-white foam head, drops off only slightly with a bunch of clumpy chunks leftover and some very intricate and sticky lacing. This look harkens back to the good'ol days of straight American IPA's of the West Coast Style.  The hop aroma really does smell like fresh whole cone flowers went into tbe boil. Sweet pine, red and tropical fruits with a honey soaked bready malt thing that really pops right out of the glass.   This full-on medium bodied beauty packs a seriously crisp and dry bite right off.  Full of lovely, fresh, grassy hop flavors that impresses me due to it's  wet  hop flavor punch and very earthy-dry herbal hop kick in the finish. Very complex hop flavor profile here! The IBU's are pumped up past the New England styles, with a difinitive blast of bitter, earthy and dry tones. Thats not o say there isnt a fair amount of juicy hop flavors, such as the sweeter side of tropical punch.  The balance is one of a pefectly executed  American IPA  in style, fat hops and a tasty malt base that is classicly sweet, bready, herbal and somewhat earthy to the core. The malt has an excellent flavor that is very easy to distinguish from the various hoppy aspects.  Folks, this one is packed with a heady array of hop colors, ranging from juicy to earthy and everything in between. Ditto for the malt, and the fresh, crisp and poppy mouthfeel leaves you worried that it will soon be gone. Stock up Hop Heads.","  rDev Poured from a can ,a dark orange honey color color with big off-white head leaving lots of foamy lacing. Nose is tropical fruit over sweet malt. Taste follows with mild hop bitterness. Goes down smooth and easy.","  rDev Pours a mild golden hue with a frothy head into my glass. Canned 1/28/19. Crisp, doughy malt with a clean citrus hop presence in the nose. Grapefruit and mango come to mind on the tongue. A lot more bitter than I expected, reminiscent of the OG west coast IPAs. Easy to drink and well worth a try.","  rDev Nice medium body and carbonation. Aroma is citrus peel,citrus fruit,a touch of pine and malt backing it all up Taste is almost exactly as the aroma hints at. It delivers everything an ipa should but in a perfectly subdued way.","  rDev Pours a clean crisp amber body with a massive pillowy billow of foam that doesn't want to disappear. Incredible sticky lacing.  Body has some grains and caramel malts as a bed for the floral citrus hops.  Some malt helps keep everything balanced and in check, but the hops are the star here. Even with that, they are not overwhelming, but smoothe and intentional in their assertions like controlled violence. Earthy notes support the citrus, and it turns to a bitter pithy finish at the end.   Bitter finish carries, as the body is just the right weight and the carbonation touches in to accentuate and never distract. This has an incredible reputation and it's well earned as this is pretty much exactly what an IPA is supposed to taste like. I could see myself drinking a lot of it if I lived where it is."]},{"Name":"Centennial IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/5441/","Brewery":"Founders Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.20,"Score":92.0,"Comments":["  rDev This is the third in my, currently 3-day long, intentional chase to bolster my Beers Of Fame list... now at 164. I suppose drinking this easy-to-find ale (released 19 years ago) gives away my bias: that I venture a lot less into the IPAs than most.  This also suggests I've been missing something. Drinking Centennial also gives me cause to speculate another theory about something I appreciate in moderation: that single hope ales like Centennial are both difficult for the brewer and the drinker. For the brewer, too many single hop brews require them to blend the malts better to meet the narrow range of what a single hop does. (So to keep it simple, the brewer blends the hops to meet the requirements of the malts.) On the other end, drinkers don't get the variety of sensations of multiple hops -- yanking our buds from sweet to bitter -- and, instead, have to work with our buds to appreciate a narrower range of differentiation.   All that said for a purpose... Centennial achieves what too few single hop brews achieve: it gives a variety of sensation from one hop, the Centennial. That, at least, is my theory. What think you ?","  rDev Sample from bottle at Vectura-messe. Orange colour. Aroma of crystal malts and orangey American hops. Sharp hoppy flavour throughout. Not particularly impressed by this one.","  rDev A dark copper color with a small off-white head that left a little bit of lace. Aroma of citrus, sweet malt, a little bit of pine.

There's lots of carbonation and beautiful glass lacing here. Little aroma compared to the full taste this ale brings. An epitome of the reason I prefer the IPA style. At first there's a complexity of malty sweetness and a hoppy bitterness, which carries to the finish.The mouth feel is slightly off of a smooth delivery, perhaps because my samples had so much carbonation. This is solid, but not among the elite.","  rDev 19.2 oz . can purchased from Safeway in West Salem OR. this just appeared the other day but it was canned 3 months ago..damn i hate this..always happens when i see a beer from out of the region it is always old. anyway lets see how it held up.

First beer. Has a big beautiful head and leaves frothy lacing as it recedes. Has a pretty copper color. The smell is equally awesome as I get sweet malt and hops. Wife says it smells like honeysuckle. Taste is good. Reminds me more of a West Coast Style with lots of hops and some hop bitterness. It's not overpowering and leaves a bitter residue on the tongue.

This is a great way to switch it up. Can. Nice khaki white head with great retention and lace. Clear copper color. What a beut.  Pine, floral notes, resin, grapefruit citrus. Bready/biscuity malts with some caramel. Nice bitterness/stickiness. I am in heaven.   This beer has stood the test of time. Still drinks amazingly after all these years.

I get some lemon, grapefruit, and honeysuckle... some boozy funk also adds a dimension that makes this chewy... as Founders go, another winner, and one that allows the drinker to indulge in a singular hop's offering... sticky sweet, and one I will seek in fifteen-can packages in the near future...","  rDev Nice IPA, amber color with some head and some lingering lacing. Smells of floral and citrus hops, tastes the same along with some biscuit and malt. Finishes somewhat bitter although quite mild and not unpleasant. Mild carbonation that fades as the beer warms. Thin, surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. A nice IPA to drink but not quite what I would call “sessionable.”","  rDev Pours a deep amber, coppery coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of caramel, biscuity malt, orange rind and pine. Taste follows the note, being driven by caramel, biscuity malt and hoppy citrus notes of orange rind and tangerine. Quite resinous, with a strong pine note as well. Finishes with a medium bitterness and more pine coming through. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This has quite a resinous character and a very nice malt/hop balance. Very nice east coast IPA.","  rDev Clear amber with one finger of white head. Nice array of lace. Smell is floral and resinous.

It is a very nice looking beer with its orange-amber clear appearance and foamy off-white head.  The aroma brings out an inviting, teasing orange or tangerine fruitiness with a kind of sweet white bread undercurrent.  The body is in the medium range. Comfortable on my tongue.  I get a boastful orange and tangerine presence in the flavor too as I did in the aroma. A kind of mild sweetness leading to a moderate bitterness to end. It's the kind of modern, hoppy IPA I could drink often. I'm surprised it took me this long to review it.","  rDev 12oz bottle dated 06/24/17 poured into a short chalice shows a cloudy, orange-gold colored body floating an impressive 1in white foam head.

Boozy for what it is.... had this one past it's 'best by' which probably didn't help (thanks Wegmans).","  rDev Poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear copper color with a huge, slightly off-white head that's well over an inch this when first poured. This head has excellent retention. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some lightly toasted, slightly biscuit malts along with a big floral and citrus hop presence. The taste is pretty similar, with lightly toasted, somewhat bready, caramel malt sweetness that gives way to a nice floral, citrus, and piney hop bitterness. Good balance of flavors here. This is not overly bitter the way some IPAs are. And don't get me wrong, I enjoy very hop bitterness forward IPAs a lot too that are very aggressively hoped, but I also can appreciate a good IPA that takes a more refined, balanced approach with the its flavor profile. And that is the case here. Has a crisp, slightly oily, yet smooth and decently frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Has a clean finish and a just slightly dry aftertaste. An excellent beer all around here.  Eric","  Beautiful clear deep amber gold color with bountiful cap and good lacing.  Aroma of a floral garden located in the midst of a citrus grove. There's a touch of conifer in the background but that may be my imagination. There is a muted heavier presence which I presume is the malt.  Surprisingly malty on entry. I say surprising because I was really expecting a hop first hit but that didn't happen until the liquid nectar hit the back of my tongue where hops sprang forth is a most pleasant way. Hop muscles are being flexed but it's more like runners than wrestlers, a light, smooth flowing of hop flavor that builds up to but does not cross over inter bitterness. I could drink this all day but at 7.2% don't know how far I'd get.  Full bodied malt texture that is substantial without being heavy and enough carbonation to keep things balanced.  Perfect swing and a hole in one, this is an outstanding brew. Complex, well crafted, beautifully balanced, think I'll have another.","  rDev Pours a deep rich amber, crystal clear, thick tan head that persists quite nicely. Bright clean nose, floral and citrus with a bit of malt behind the hop. Nice hop flavor, lightly citrus primarily with a nice caramel malt back. Not as big a flavor as many American IPAs but certainly a nice crisp beer. Mouthfeel is a little thin for an IPA in my book, but that also means it can't be accused of being overly syrupy and you can certainly see a handful or more of these on a warm summer day. Overall a strong IPA that has the kind of broad appeal that makes it perfect for putting out at a BBQ. And with 15 packs of cans going for $17 (and that's out here on the west coast, all the way across the country) it's easy to see how this could become a staple for any beer fan.","  rDev Poured from 12-ounce can into a pilsner glass. Clear copper color, with a three-finger white head that left some nice lacing. This sample was two months past the canning date, which may have been the reason for the muted hop aromas and flavors I experienced. Even so, there was quite a bit of resiny bitterness to balance the sweet, almost caramelly malt presence. finish is dry, with some lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue.

This is one that I drink occasionally, when I revisit it like an old friend.","  rDev 12oz bottle, 2017 vintage courtesy of Blue Max Liquors  Looks like a 2020 bottle, big mocha head, plenty of carbonation still. Smells like a sweet raisin bread, with hints of vanilla, aromatic hops, and metallic booze. Taste is spicy with alcohol and what's left of the hops at first, then it goes into malt mode - the flavors have mellowed and congealed over time, like if you refined that same bread from the nose into a diamond bullet of flavor. Dark fruits and chocolate dominate, then the booze and oak (which have fused to become one) come in to balance the sweetness, finally a kiss of hops: all this sits on your tongue for minutes afterward; sip it.  Ageing this beer makes it into twice the beer it once was. I'll only have my bastard aged from now on","  rDev Medium light carbonation with just above average body. Aroma is malt,brown sugar,dark fruit,,grainy doughy fruit cake. And molasses. A little earthy and definitely wood Taste is dark fruit, malt,alcohol, molasses. And a sweet sugary bourbon taste that lingers Overall it's a really well done beer that if this is a style you like it's worth trying","  rDev 10 yr old bottle courtesy of acurtis.  L: dark brown, a little amber, almost no head.  S: Brown sugar, Molasses, wood, vanilla, raisins.  T: molasses, caramel/toffee, peat/river/dirt, raisins, wood, musty, little oxidization.  F: medium/thin, and a little boozy, no carbonation.  Overall: Very solid for a 10 yr old beer. No booziness or soy sauce weirdness.","  rDev L: Very dark brown color, half finger tan colored head, excellent thin lacing, light carbonation. Looks glorious.  S: Malts, caramel, oak. Just wow!  T: Malts, caramel, oak. Soooooo smooth and delicious. Incredible.  F: Medium bodied, full of malt and oak flavors.  O: A masterpiece.","  rDev Bottled 12/20/19  Pours a slightly murky reddish brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring, no lacing  Nutty aromas greet the nose first, some lovely brown sugar, slightly smokey malts. Caramel and dried fruits like figs, some dark bread. Not a huge barrel presence in the nose, just a slight alcohol tinge  Taste is really similar to the nose, more bourbon here, some more chocolate and vanilla notes too. The darker fruit comes out stronger here too, very malty sweet  Not too much carbonation on here but it lends to a nice, slick mouthfeel. Heavy body and finishes sweet, absolutely decadent  Wow, this was my first scotch ale, it's the top rated of the style, and I absolutely love it. Sweet and rich, this is a great dessert and alternative to an imperial stout. Picking this one up often","  rDev A dark brown/red color with a small tan head. Aroma of booze, caramel, vanilla, and smoke/peat. Taste follows the nose. Whiskey, caramel, smoke. Medium-bodied, nice sipping beer.","  rDev 12oz bottle with Stone IRS snifter  Notes from Jan 16 2016  The body is a dark blackish-brown color with a thick lather of dark khaki foam that lids the glass. Some intermittent swaths of lace action noted. The nose brings an incredibly deep dark caramel nougat rich with fig and date. Very reminiscent of a raisin bread. Vanilla and caramel malt is pronounced in the flavor with an earthy hop bitterness and a touch of chocolate roast noted in the finish. This brew is boozy and fiery but in a very good way. Not overly hot. All in all not a ton of barrel notes too me but wow what a fantastic brew!  Founders does amazing BA beers.  Thank you Founders for bringing your distro to SoCal.","  rDev Bottle-conditioned. L- Very deep ruby chestnut. By lamplight and with the glass on my desk it might as well be black. Pours with 3mm fine-bubble tan head. Held to a light I can see it's poured with some fine sediment. S- Some whisky notes, plus a bit of timber. T- ... a swift descent into a timber barrel of flavours with whisky being clearly very prominent. Fighting through that I believe I got a couple of flashes of deep fruits, perhaps cherry. The finish is a liquorish ABV-zing on the tongue. F- Deep, pretty intense, parallel richness balances it out. O- It's a big beast this Bastard, but it's superbly crafted. It could overwhelm but it somehow manages not to. I drink a very occasional whisky and enjoyed this. So I asked my wife who isn't a whisky fan what she thought &gt; 'I enjoyed it, the whisky wasn't THAT prominent, only really when I slooshed it around my mouth, I like it'. So my earlier idea you need to be a whisky fan to enjoy this goes right out of the window. 355ml (US 12FlOz). '2017 Release'. Bottled on: 07/20/17. Bought from Beerhawk/UK.","  rDev Another classic I have somehow never reviewed. This one has been sitting in the fridge for at least three months so I am hoping it is extra smooth. Big mahoghany body and stubborn creamy head. Nose is whisky, wood, vanilla, and smoke.   Flavor is obviously sweet and boozy but still disciplined and neat. Burnt caramel and peat also make an appearance. This is a mellow sipper with a load of complexity. Mouthfeel is luxurious and coating. Not exactly my style, but this is incredibly well made.","  rDev Clear brown with four fingers of tan head. Massive lacings as the head slowly drops. Smell is dark malts with some herbal hops. Taste is molasses dark malts with a bit of herbal hops. Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. The finish is dry but balanced. Overall a big beer that masks the alcohol well.","  rDev Outstanding beer. Gets even better as it warms up a bit. The bourbon is noticeable, but relatively subtle. Great mouthfeel and a lot of complexity to this beer. I actually think I prefer this over KBS and it's substantially cheaper. Gotta go slow with it though or it will kick your ass. Nothing here not to like.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; bottled on 08/01/18. Later had it on tap at the Founder's Brewery in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A: Pours a largely clear, dark copper color with a two and a half finger, foamy, cappuccino brown head, strong retention and solid, if spidery, lacing. S: Bourbon aroma predominates with milk chocolate, cookie/biscuit, honey, and molasses. T: Sweet. Palate largely follows the nose, with a birch beer/root beer/sarsaparilla and orange notes. Boozy. Bitterness is in a complex interaction with sweetness and booziness. M: Full bodied with moderate to strong carbonation.  O: Very drinkable and complex. The barrel aging definitely added to the character. Clearly better on tap.","  rDev 16oz bottle, with a bottling date of '10/15/2014. Purchased a couple of years ago at the  Cellar  event at Elevated BW&amp;S, south Minneapolis. Brown colored body with light tan head, which fades away to a scattered island and thin ring. No lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, molasses, dark fruit (prunes and raisins), and bourbon barrel with vanilla. Taste of dark fruits, molasses, bourbon barrel with vanilla. The end is peaty, with a little smoke and char. Medium mouth feel, with a touch of syrup. Good carbonation. This might be showing a little oxidation age, but the beer has held up well, with a visible head upon pouring and a full taste profile. The flavors go from sweet to slightly bitter with the peaty smoke and char.","  rDev Wonderful stained mahogany body. Beige head, with hints of pastel yellow, almost shiny. Leaves a pencil line thin ring around the glass. Malty sweet aroma. Roasty, caramel, toffee, wood and alcohol. Toasted, roasted malts in the taste with plenty of caramel sweetness. Lots of barrel but delicately balanced.  Heavy body. Medium carbonation. Dry bitter finish with a bite of pepper, smoke and char.","  rDev 355 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Jul 20 2018 (2017 batch, 11.1%) and served slightly chilled. Not the ideal candidate for review (given its age), but what're ya gonna do - I'm just trying to clean my cellar out.  Pours a very dark mahogany brown colour, with ruby red highlights and some flocculence. One finger of frothy, tan-coloured head rises to the surface, lasting for no more than 90 seconds as it quickly wilts down to a soapy collar of bubbly foam. The scattered lines of lacing are a bit scant, but it looks good otherwise. Straight-up bourbon whiskey is by far the most noticeable element of the aroma - bold and unrelenting, with oak wood, vanilla, treacle and toffee adding some depth to the nose. The alcohol fumes are also difficult to miss, though the opposite is true of its hints of date, raisin and chocolate.  A beast of a beer, of that there can be no doubt; the bourbon whiskey remains dominant, with rich dark malt flavours of treacle, toffee and toasted nuts also coming through in force. Fruity notes of date and raisin crop up by mid-sip, with barrel character of oak and vanilla not far behind. Finishes herbal and a little spicy, with suggestions of black cherry and butterscotch coming through at the beginning of a long, shamelessly boozy aftertaste that includes some charred wood flavour. Full-bodied, with low carbonation levels that barely register; feels smooth and soft on the palate, with (slight) numbing and warming effects from the ethanol. Reasonably drinkable, perhaps even dangerously so.  Final Grade: 4.13, an A-. Backwoods Bastard is not a subtle beer, but that shouldn't come as a shock to those who are familiar with Founders' BA series. Honestly, I think I'd take Dirty Bastard over this BBA variant, nine times out of ten - though to be fair, I don't love bourbon, I merely tolerate it - and this is the very definition of a bourbon bomb, with the spirit totally overwhelming the base wee heavy. If that's what you're in the mood for, then look no further, I guess - but if you're like me, this beer will serve as more of an interesting diversion vs. a mind blowing must-try. Worth a go if you can find it... I'll update this review as needed, if I stumble upon a fresh bottle.","  rDev DATE: December 1, 2018... OCCASION: the tree is up in all its glory... time for part two of my Founders big beer comparisons... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours a dark black body that sports an off-white, thick, creamy head that arcs into extensive coral... the thick scent of vanilla, creme brulee, lactic acid, sweet bourbon, peat, and more bourbon--this hits with strength and allure....its first sip is ridiculously smooth and easy... there is not a hint of alcohol in its medium body, with a creaminess that resides well after it begins... subtly destructive... the vanilla and bourbon make this an unbelievable flavor, with residual peat, brackish malts that rise like sweet rye... this is a beer I cannot believe was available for eight bucks a grunt, making an event of the night... takes the Dirty Bastard and ups the ante..","  rDev 2017 Release.  This beer pours a deep rusty brown, murky and dark, but with a reddish hue that you can spot in certain lighting. The head is about two and a half fingers thick, frothy and leaving small archipelagos of lace around the glass as it settles.  Sweet, dark fruit, oak, malt, and molasses greet the nose. It’s got a subtle but present peat and as it warms, hints of chocolate as well. At first I wasn’t a huge fan of the nose , but as it warms I really get a well-balanced complexity that only improves with every sip.  For 11+%, I expected a heavier, more in-your-face flavor profile. Granted, this is 2017’s release, so it seems that time has only mellowed this beer. Peat, malt, bitter fruit, booze, and light hops characterize a beer that functions well together as a whole, but I expected just a little more when combining the complimentary oak bourbon barrels and scotch ale style.  Smooth, medium mouthfeel. A fairly low but apparent carbonation. Smooth, warm, and not overly boozy. Sticky finish.","  rDev Pours deep mahogany with cherry glints. The gigantic tan head lasts forever and drapes the glass in lace. Malty, peaty aroma. Rich. complex malt flavors explode in the first sip. Peaty, roasty, turbinado sugar, vanilla all in the mix. Oakiness and warming alcohol in the back. Ripe berries and cocoa too. Full bodied with light, creamy carbonation. Light bitterness and thick maltiness in the finish. Alcohol heft is understated throughout.  A fantastic Wee Heavy, a celebration of malts. Juicy and complex. A must try world class beer.","  rDev Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of molasses, whiskey. Taste is whiskey, dark fruits, molasses, malts, somewhat sweet, alcohol is present throughout. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer worth trying.","  rDev Dark semi-transparent appearance with tan head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a sweet malt with bourbon. Taste is also a pleasant blend of malt and boubon that is slightly sweet and smooth.","  rDev Appearance: An opaque brown body that is even when put up to direct light reveals little. A finger of head was produced that did not produce any lace but retained exceptionally well.  Smell: Very potent, but I don't think I am a fan of what this brew portends. In particular I pickup a strong molasses note, powerfully roasted malt and a solvent like quality that comes from a high alcohol brew that doesn't hide that fact well. Warming brings it out more, but it is completely irrelevant as it's strong at time of pour.  Taste: Shortbread and toffee malt starts us out masterfully as there is just the right amount of underlying sweetness, it continues to build with a slight charred oak hit with hints of raisins. Sadly while doing so, what I feared creeps into the beer, a powerful alcohol twang that punctuates the beer with some earthy hops giving it a very strong whiskey like note. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but that undisguised alcohol should either be concealed or embraced without as much sweetness to start.  Mouthfeel: As stated, it has a solvent quality to it that is undesirable to me, unless you are really playing up the scotch and whiskey aspect. This one does at the end, but certainly doesn't at the start. That leads me to my biggest issue with the beer, it's transitioning, and it's not too often I encounter this problem (because most brewers don't seem to be able to pull it off). Most times when I take issue with transitioning, it's because the beer doesn't go from one flavor to another in a smooth fashion. That it feels either rocky or a 90 degree turn. I don't get that here, as it seems to make it journey from almost excessively sweet, to boozy, bitter, charred whiskey in a fairly graceful fashion. The issue is that it's simply too far a spectrum in such a short period of time. It's like a one day cruise. Sure, it's nice and I get to my destination, but it seems like the cruise was a waste and I could have flown for cheaper. Anyways, the carbonation is good and the aftertaste is still a bit boozy and cloyingly sweet.  Drinkability: Not as heavy as I would expect from something this boozy, but just on the heavier end of medium bodied. It's not quite a meal, but would say an appetizer for sure. Not exactly what I could call refreshing, but Scotch ale doesn't usually fill that niche. I like that it avoids dry aspects but I'm not a big fan of the feeling it leaves.  Final Thoughts: When I drank this, my mind actually wandered to a quote from a Sherlock Holmes adventure. I decided to look it up. It was from  The Adventure of the Norwood builder  where Holmes explaining how he caught the criminal in this adventure said  But he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge of when to stop.  which pretty much echoes my sentiment on a lot of beer from the US (apart from the tried and true stereotype that macro lager is water, but I digress). This beer I feel perfectly expresses that sentiment. There is such an extreme transition here, that it comes across as drowning out it's own substance. Cranking the volume to 11 often deafens the listener to the music. Pretty much, the niche of this beer is after dinner in the fall or winter instead of whisky, because dinner wasn't substantial enough. As good as this beer is, it's far too small a niche for my liking.","  rDev Pours a bit of head, but it dissipates... only a little leg.  Aroma of bourbon and beer nuts is seriously enticing.  Lots of whiskey (seriously boozy) and fresh oak in the flavour, nuts, caramel, sponge toffee, raisin.  Light residual sweetness with a drying finish.","  rDev 6/7/18: 2017 release, 12 ounce poured into snifter. ($6 per beer, four pack, purchased at Capone's). Pitch black pour, razor thin lacing. Strong bourbon aroma, Chocolate and bourbon predominant taste, hint of coffee. Strong carbonation holds, thin texture, easy drinking. ABV packs a punch.","  rDev Vintage 2016 (bottled on 10/6/16)  Pours a deep amber-brown with a short-lied but beautiful off-white head; lots of lacing follows each sip  Aromas of ightly charred oak chips tossed with dark fruit strike first, synchronizing perfectly with the oncoming bourbon and vanilla   Taste shows the more decadent side of the fruits and bourbon arriving, but never becoming too cloying amongst scotch notes which have now become firmly established as the backbone of the flavor profile; an unexpectedly savory dark chocolate finish also presents itself on occasion   Mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy, and there really is no trace of alcohol in this  This is almost stunningly well-structured, and the 1.5 years of aging has only seemed to reveal the nuance in this beer's myriad of flavor even further. I'm usually one for more of a bite to my higher ABV brews, but the character shown in this one despite the lack of a kick just can't be ignored; I'm no expert on the style by any means, but it's tough to imagine another scotch ale topping this, at least in terms of flavor and mouthfeel.","  rDev 2017 release. 12 oz bottle from the US. Served cool into a tulip glass. I was super excited when I saw this was waiting for me at home. Cracking this bottle has a slow eruption of foam that requires quick thinking to get it in the glass.  Appearance - Pours clear and the darkest shade of ruby I've ever seen. Near black unless held up to natural light when a mahogany and ruby mixture appears again. Capped with two fingers of yellowy tan head, pretty decent retention, curtains of lacing stick to the glass.  Smell - Oh Yeah! Single malt whiskey is apparent on the nose, with toffee and butterscotch, figs, raisins and dates, with hints of oak as well as bourbon. Complex, inviting, everything good it's got in spades. Smells like a boozy Christmas cake too.  Taste - Hard to describe since there's so much going on. Initially sweet with toffee and butterscotch and caramel, followed by a hit of booze (bourbon mostly). Some earthy hops shine through momentarily before oak and whiskey come through to enhance the middling bitterness. Figs and raisins are interspersed. If I have a complaints it's the the full breadth of flavors don't linger on the plate quite as long as I'd hoped, because they are some delicious flavors.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation is present, but super smooth and sticky, this slides down the throat way too easily. A nice little whiskey burn at the end, but luscious, thick and slick.   Overall - Yeah, this is about as good as a wee heavy can get, loads of flavor, amazing aromatics and a feel to die for. The only thing I'm missing is smoke, but with some high quality whiskey flavors in there, I can live without the smoke, I might try this a bit colder to see how the flavors change while warming up, but hats off to Founders on creating a near perfect Wee Heavy.","  rDev Nice dark rich color with mild head, smells of bourbon, maple and malt. Nice deep taste, just like it smells with additional notes of mild floral hops and fruitiness. Smooth mouthfeel, not too heavy, light carbonation, alcohol taste not too strong throughout. Definitely a beer to sip slowly and savor.","  rDev Dark brown in color with ruby hues and a hazy appearance. Poured with a tall, creamy, dark tan foam with very good retention. Sweet bourbon, earthy dark malt and toasty malt aromas with notes of vanilla, dark fruit and brown bread. Full bodied with medium light carbonation. Rich, creamy smooth feel up front followed by pleasant boozy warmth through the finish. Medium high, boozy bourbon flavors with sweet dark and toasted malt flavors. Medium light, earthy hop bitterness through the middle is difficult to distinguish from the prickly, boozy bite. Dark malt with dark caramel notes on the back end with hints of dark toasted crust. Finished with mellow, sweet, boozy bourbon notes, hints of vanilla and earthy dark malt. Although I am not a bourbon drinker, this was pretty tasty. Definitely a sipper. Malt character was able to show through just enough to balance the boozy scotch presence. Fabulous feel , with pleasant warmth.","  rDev Bottle from Brewers Haven. Dark brown / mahogany, small fizzy head subsides to ring. Aroma is big and full, roast malts, molasses, peat. Taste comes with some alcohol warmth, sweet and slick, more brown sugar, caramel, tobacco. Velvety feel. Definitely a world class beer."]},{"Name":"Nugget Nectar","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/694/15881/","Brewery":"Tröegs Brewing Company","Style":"Red Ale - Imperial","Alcohol":7.50,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev Clear and bright body, medium amber colored; excellent carbonation, fine bubbles and gently rising; huge, white head, sculpted and densely creamy.

My first imperial red, and it's the highest rated of the style! This is a truly legendary beer, and I'm so happy to finally try it. Let's not waste any more time and just dive in  Pours an absolutely crystal clear golden amber with a finger and a half of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves great lacing  The simplicity of the aroma is quite appealing, as it shows a great balance between malt and hops. I'm picking up on aromas of pithy grapefruit, resinous piney hops, honey sweetness, lightly spicy red malt, doughy bread, and juicy orange  The somewhat understated aroma really pops in flavor, but maintains the fantastic balance that it set up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh pine, juicy orange, honey, doughy malt, and a hint of pepper. The swallow brings notes of dank weed, underripe melon, grapefruit, red malt, oily hops, and crisp bready malt  A medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a super smooth and crisp beer, drinking well under 7.5% Finishes incredibly dry with a nice lingering bitterness  Well shit, color me impressed. It's so simple, but it's more than just the sum of its parts. I need more. I could find some really good food pairings for this one","  rDev Best before 4/29/21; consumed on 2/8/21  Pours a crystal-clear, deep copper body, glistening and steadily effervescent, capped with multiple fingers of thick, fluffy, off-white foam; great head retention yields a half-finger of creamy cap, a broad, soapy collar, and many thin layers of chunky, webby lacing coating the walls of the glass.  Aroma starts off with a wave of honeyed malt sweetness, quickly establishing a foundation for ruby red grapefruit and pine laced with a dense array of sweaty, dank hop resins evolving over the middle with a distant tinge of bread crust interspersed throughout; peach and apricot flesh accent the back end of the bouquet as intermittent, sweet pineapple and dank mango continue driving a fading citrus tone through the close.  Taste first approaches with a suave honeyed malt balanced with the deft citric undertones of grapefruit rind upfront; building resin soon takes over, with grassy tones sporting a rawer, herbal touch over the mid-palate peaking with dirt, earth, and flaky malts into the back end, where citrus peel underscores and a light mango/apricot compote presents on the finish.  Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a fluffy, moderate carbonation; slick, bright, and paradoxically boggy with notions of a sticky weight which never quite materialize over the mid-palate, the back end highlights a prickly bitterness as a taut malt texture allows for a consistent, moderately dry finish.  In a similar vein to regional stalwarts like Sip of Sunshine, this brew sits in a perpetual flow state of sweaty hop resins and vivid yet simple malt expressions; a distinct focus on the core of natural hop characteristics gives this a perpetual appeal.","  rDev Drinking this at home due to the ongoing pandemic that prevents me from going out to have a proper pint on draft. Poured from a can into a pint glass. Appears clear, amber, with a nice foamy head that capped over into a thin head that lasted. Smells, as I was pouring it, it's floral, citrusy, piney aroma was prevalent. Taste didn't disappoint, follows the nose, tangerine notes, at 93 IBUs not all that bitter. Mouth feel is medium plus for the style. Overall at an ABV of 7.5 not boozy at all. I'd definitely order again.","  rDev 12oz can freshest by 04/22/2020 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV 93 IBU.

The taste is semisweet burnt sugar caramel with big dank hoppy overtones of evergreen and mango. Heavy bitterness throughout. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent. Very happy I picked up a six pack.","  rDev Well, for an annual  big but accessible  release, I prefer this to Hopslam. I dig the Nugget hops, as an older new-school American variety. Solid hop character, moderately resinous, but still leaving plenty of room for the grain bill to present itself.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom tasting pint; no obvious production information. A: Pours a crystal clear copper color with a one finger, off-white to wheat head, retention to a rim and minimal cap, and soapy lacing. Reminded me of cognac in color. S: Spicy with strong caramel, molasses, and honey aromas. Lemon and pine elements. More cocoa as it warms. T: Sweet to semisweet with a caramel and white pepper predominating over other elements of the nose. Peppery bitterness lingers pleasantly. M: Light to medium bodied with fairly light carbonation. Drinks smooth and citrusy.  O: My first American Imperial Red Ale. Straightforward, but quite complex. I'm a bit shocked by the ABV (7.5%) and IBU (93 or so), but that they can take one by surprise as part of the artfulness of this brew's composition. An impressive accomplishment: Kudos!","  rDev Pours a translucent amber with two fingers of white foam that retains beautifully well, with a long lingering foam ring. Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and sticky hops forming a lightly sweet, balanced nose. Bready, earthy, caramel malts round out the remainder of the aroma profile. Flavor profile is pine, resin, citrus, and lightly dank hops for a semi-sweet opening that is balanced out well by malts. Malts are bready, earthy, and caramel. Mouth feel is lightly fuzzy, with a touch of effervescence. It's a little too fuzzy to be 'crisp', but nears that level of refreshment. It has a medium thickness. Overall, balance between hops and malts are fantastic, with both being allowed to shine.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Look ? Ooooooo!!! Beautiful copper-orange!!! A lot of people don't like orange....anything... I do :) ( Official beer of Oompa Lumpas everywhere!  ??? :P ) . Luxurious off-white head, that persists for awhile, and leaves a good amount of lacing.  Aroma is ruby grapefruit, on the sweet end of the grapefruit spectrum, some sweet, honey-ish toasted malt , and some mango , as promised on the label.  Taste is pine, sweetish grapefruit, bitter-grapefruit pith, and some fruited-mead-like sweet/sour. It finishes with a rounded stab of pine/grapefruit bitterness , on the anterior quarter of the tongue, that lingers for a minute or so.  Feel is moderately oily/creamy, with some very fine carbonation tingle that mixes in, builds, and takes over on the finish.   Overall, very good. Nice balance between the fruity elements, the pine, and the sweetish malt. Smooth, and easy-drinking. The total is greater than the sum of the parts.","  rDev Clear reddish copper appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a hoppy sweet.

Had a rich amber color and a clear texture. There was a half inch of off white, foamy, fairly long-lasting head. Very good lacing.  S: A decent, but not spectacular, aroma of malt, hops, citrus, pine, and caramel.  T: Tasted of a pinch of pine resin (fleetingly so), a ton of malt (pervasively so), a fair shot of hops, a hint of caramel, light citrus notes (lemon), and some tropical fruit (mango). Kind of a one-note flavor - it seems a like a malt bomb to me - that only partially succeeds. Not terrible, but underwhelming.  F: A solid amount of carbonation with a vibrant finish. Light- to medium-bodied.  O: Like a lot of Troegs' beers I've tried, this one is overrated. It's not bad, but not great either.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip.  Pours a clear copper orange color with a finger of effervescent off-white head. The head has great retention, settling into a thin film. Leaves a minimal amount of lacing.  The aroma brings notes of caramel and bready malts, followed by a wave of piney hops and citrus.  The flavor is the perfect balance of sweet malts and bitter, piney hops. There are notes of caramel and toffee, finished off by pine and grapefruit, with a touch of orange rind.  The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly sticky, yet incredibly smooth. Has a beautiful lingering bitterness that coats the mouth in piney hops resins.  Overall, a truly great Amber ale that definitely lives up to the hype. It's very hoppy, but it's also very balanced. I would drink this all year long if I could.","  rDev Pours a deep copper amber with smaller than expected head that leaves good lace. Nose is muted compared to expectations. Malt is well present and the hops are certainly West coast style with some resin, but doesn't pop like you'd expect from a highly ranked beer.

There are malts here, they just get shadowed by pine and sweet citrus everywhere they go. Smooth as heck. I see why this is so highly regarded.","  rDev -clear, amber bottle pour with a fruity hop aroma. The flavor is dominated by fresh hops. Apricot and some grapefruit are dominant.

Aroma is very muted with a bit of sweet malt and some pine hiding in the background. Taste is a bit of a letdown in that it is quite average; moderately sweet caramel malts with some pine. Moderately bitter in the finish. Medium in body, a bit of hop slickness, a touch of almost syrup like sweetness, and moderate carbonation. Overall I was a bit let down here. I have very fond memories of this beer from years ago but it just doesn't do it for me right now.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz can into a Dogfish tulip  L: Clear golden copper pour. Two fingers of off-white head with sticky lacing.  S: Malty and rich... mixed with juicy citrusy hops. Floral as well.  T/F: Rich caramel malts... full bodied and juicy. Not bitter, but a delicious juicy/floral hop profile. Grapefruit and pineapple... hibiscus. Resinous and sticky on the tongue. Finish is caramel and juice. A little warming... hides the ABV super well.  O: A delicious Red ale/IPA hybrid that is a yearly event here in Pennsylvania. Always a favorite, and one to stock up on for some every day fantastic while supplies last.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass, well before the enjoy by date. A deep clear orange with a beautiful thick beige head and excellent lacing. Very pleasant smell, malty, sweet, and floral. The taste is very nice with caramel, orange, and a nice earthiness. A very enjoyable beer!","  rDev This is a nice enough beer but I honestly do not understand the hype. I got a fresh one from a can. It pours a reddish amber with roughly an inch of head. The nose is surprisingly devoid of too much hop aroma. The taste is similarly not as hoppy as one is made to expect and most of the bitterness arrives late. Overall, it's not as complex or unique as others describe it.","  rDev Here's a red ale with a lot of hops in it. One of the earliest examples of a hoppy beer on the East Coast, before they fell in love with orange juice beer hype.   Lots of carbonation, full 1  off white head on a red/amber ale appearance. Aroma had all that red malt and plenty of the bitter nugget hop. Is this only nugget hops? They aren't the most aromatic hop to use.  Its plenty malty, plenty bitter. Its a bigger beer than i thought at the outset. The citrus is grapefruit, there is some woodiness but not pine like. Lots of caramel. The nugget hops seem to provide more in the way of bitterness moreso than a discernable flavor.","  rDev Tröegs Nugget Nectar brewed by Tröegs Brewing Company, with an ABV of 7.50% This brew pours out a deep burnt amber color with a nice white head. This brew has a real nice look to it. The smell of Tröegs Nugget Nectar, is rich with hop bitterness grains and malts. The hops are kinda inviting to the smell of this brew. This brew has a bolder smell to it than most American Amber/Red Ales on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold and rich with flavors. You first pick up on the hops citrus bitterness in this brew. Then there is a nice citrus sweetness, and grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Tröegs Nugget Nectar. This brew has a real nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. It is real hard to pick up on the 7.50% ABV in this brew.

OCCASION: celebrating the first day of grilling and the Cavs' first playoff win--fifteen more to go... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... APPEARANCE: crystal clear dark copper amber body sits squarely below a thick, creamy white head with sincere staying power... nice stratified lacing, paralleling as a sunset might... AROMA: the nugget releases strong floral, resinous aura while the tomahawk releases a bitter, orange peel/pineapple... PALATE: at 7.5ish% ABV, more than palatable--one could see why Troegs tried to call this an Imperial amber, as the back end suggests a maltiness that clips its bitterness and enables swift sipping... medium-bodied and  easy,  with a slight pill at the teeth and a mellow movement to the throat... TASTE: an earthiness grounds a complex profile, with orange, pineapple, mango and soft fruits eliciting the lion's share of attention... malts are sweet bread and caramel... a combination that is mellow, reasonably weighted, and balanced... OVERALL: a lot to like about this one... after having heard so much about it, I had no fear of being let down, but rather a feeling of hop-head conflation... into the second bottle, an aromatic, resinous experience--can stand up to or next to the many illustrious IPAs out there... another win from Troegs....","  rDev Look - Amber Orangish hazy color with a great white head and sticky lacing. smell - Very floral off the first scent.

Sweet malty, boozy aroma. Taste initially starts with some caramel, then hops, before being obliterated by the ABV. Malt-bomb and hop-bomb....double whammy!","  rDev I recognize that I am late to this party; having 15 from Dogfish, but having avoided the 120 Minutes... being a malt-head. But, what was I worrying about ?  What brought me here was that 120 is on BA's Beers of Fame. And while I had closed in on 2/3 of the Fames, I avoided the easy hoppy hits... and 120 is among them. So after I got a copy that was bottled two years ago, I cellared it until I was mature enough to appreciate better what it is that the hopheads want. I'm not sure I am truly more mature and still do not know what hopheads want, but now was the time to start. I popped its famous top. But first, a comment on what hot water does.  120 Minutes is a long time to boil anything. From a culinary perspective, remember it is a long 10 minutes for fettuccine (which depends on the sauce) and 8 minutes to hard-boil an egg (one of the most nutritiously intense things you can eat.) So if you boil something 120 minutes, you better be producing something special.  And of course, Dogfish did. 120 Looks like not IIPA I can remember seeing, a beautiful amber. The Smells, Tastes and Feel all are integrated by a dedication to using hops to balance malt.   Despite this being my 16th Dogfish, I suspect I've never done them a micro-review... now into its second year of ownership by Boston Beer, the Big Popi of the craft beer movement. How that plays out will mostly be for the Good. For as a purchase, Dogfish understand brewing's depth. Dogfish is active in all three traditions (probably excelling in two.) It has combined brewing with thoughtful kitchen menus for 25 years and it built a 15 room Inn (brining in the British tradition.) And then, it opened a second shop in Miami, tourism central, just to prove its point.   All that said, I think that only a few second generation crafters (20th Century) are as visionary as Dogfish and, when the final analysis is done, Dogfish may be second to none. A good purchase by Boston. Cheers !","  rDev Poured from 12 oz bottle into shaker pint glass. A: Pours a surprisingly dark golden hue with a 1/4 inch light tan head that quickly recedes. S: What an interesting aroma! White wine, white grape, earthy herbal notes, with hints of pine, caramel malt, and soft spice. T: Herbal earth notes, soft spice, caramel malt, white wine, white grape, and soft pine resin. Follows the aroma, but even stronger/better. M: Medium-heavy body. Slightly oily feel. Subtle and soft earthy sweetness. Lingers on the palate in an interesting heavy and yet light way at the same time. D: Wow, what an interesting brew!

Orange to amber colour, low off-white head. Extreme and intense aroma of American hops, on a background of sweet malts.

Smells like honey moonshine and hops. Hot alcohol on the exhale, I feel like I'm sipping whisky. Very, very sweet on the tongue, an almost unbearable sweetness, the sweetness of rot or death, the deathly mixture of loads of honey malt and ~20% alcohol. It's almost like a poorly-done mead, it's soo sweet with tons of alcohol burn.. I aged this a couple months, bought it new. There's no way the hops faded *that* much. If I am drinking this as intended (I assume I am), then it is a weird white wine malt-bomb - not at all what I was expecting from a beer with such prestige.  One-note white wine hops over tons of honey malt. As a black-and-tan with World Wide Stout: very interesting 20% b&amp;t that mellows out the white wine funk and turns into more of a beer than an abomination","  rDev 120 Minute IPA has a thin, ivory head, a translucent orange appearance, with some roiling off-white sediment, a central bubble stream, and a good deal of lacing. The aroma is of intense apricot marmalade and chutney. The flavor is of very sweet white bread crust, resinous hop oils, bitterness, and the chutney. 120 Minute IPA has a somewhat heavy body and a dry finish.   RJT","  rDev From cask n flask San Jose.

Aromas of sweet caramel malt, booze, vanilla, and a touch of citrus. Flavor is a rolling mix of vanilla, salted caramel, biscuit, something oaky. Barley wine ish.","  rDev Bottled 6/29/20, about as fresh as anyone has these I presume  Well, here it is. I know it’s not all that rare, but it’s a whale for me, and the last of the DFH “Minute” IPAs for me to try. I found a 4 pack of this and also grabbed an extra single so I can lay some down in the cellar  Pours a murky burnt orange with a small cap of off white head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing and legs  A well balanced aroma brings notes of sweet orange, earthy cinnamon, herbal hops, lemon rind, and brown sugar. Way more malt than hops, it smells very rich and caramel like, not unlike an aged 90 Minute  The beginning of the sip brings notes of sweet sherry, caramel, and overripe grapefruit. Mid palate, the focus shifts more towards the caustic side of things, with a mix of grapefruit rind, pine, caramel malts, and fairly strong alcohol (duh). The aftertaste is very long, with lingering notes of brown sugar, alcohol, and orange  This does not drink like 18% at all. I get the the abv is variable, and the exact for this vintage is unknown, but it drinks closer to 8% than 18%. A chewy medium body with nice peppy carbonation leads to a full and smooth drink that finishes sticky and sweet  Dogfish Head is all about pushing boundaries, and that is precisely what they did here. No IPA should be this size, this malty, or this flavorful. Yet, they pull it off flawlessly. Well done, I can’t wait to revisit this at 2, 3, 5, and 10 years and see how it develops. Cheers BA, I loved this  EDIT 11/6/21  So Half Time in Mamaroneck had a 2015 vintage of this for growler fills that I picked up yesterday. I'm jumping the gun on seeing how it progresses over time, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity on this one. On the pour, it's much more alive in the glass, with the head growing as I let it sit. Strange. Some more lacing too. The age shows in aroma, but the hop presence is still huge, a nice balance of herbal hops, toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, and sweet sherry. In taste, the hops have faded a bit more, really letting the caramel shine up front, though with some white pepper. The swallow is sweet as ever and pretty much the same. I guess it just loses it's pithy bite and replaces it with a peppery one. Still the same in feel as well. It's really impressive how it hasn't changed a crazy amount in 6 years, but the change that has occurred is really nice. I would say it's not quite as good as fresh 120, but with a vastly improved appearance I bumped that rating up a bit","  rDev Had the 120 poured from 12-oz. bottle, stamped below the label  0336 B2 1/22 5 or S], * gift from friend  a couple years ago,  into Teku 3.0 tulip.  *Does anyone know how old this bottle is?  The huge aroma of citrus (and pine) off the pour, backed by moderate malt, builds one's expectations. They are not disappointed. Distilled citrus fruits, brandy, hop and alcohol bite in the finish.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip.  A bottle dated September 13, 2019, purchased i October ad squirreled away per the  ages well  label.  Pours a murky reddish amber with a fast subsiding head but excellent lacing. It sort of looks like unfiltered apple cider.  The aromas are daunting and inviting at the same time. Caramel malt, bread, tropical fruit (papaya and mango) and some booze, but not as much as expected.  The brew is certainly a sipper. Strong caramel malts on the tip of the tongue, backed by overripe versions of the fruit on the nose--mango, papaya--and some strong booze. The hops ride in the back initially on this one, but they slowly grow and hammer with a vengeance at the finish, with cedar resin bitterness.   Definitely full bodied, the brew is less boozy and more drinkable than expected.   Does it live up to its hype? I'm not sure, which means, probably not. But it's an impressive brew nonetheless.","  rDev Pours a hazy, particulate laden pale amber producing almost 2 fingers of moderately lasting, chunky, white head that leaves a lumpy surface cap, thick collar ring and nice rings and strings of lace. Aroma is an earthy blend of humidor cedar, caramel, pale brown sugar, sugary vanilla, pine resin and thin citrus hops swimming in alcohol booze but for an 18% ABV I might say it is reserved. Taste is sugary malt sweetness, fruity candied apple, cedar, resinous pine and thin citrus hops up front through mid-sip; it reaches full throttle hop dominance just before the finish. It is delightfully bitter in the aftertaste. Starts predominantly sweet before turning hoppy, finishing extremely hoppy and bitter. Alcohol prominent throughout and expressed as warmth, bitterness and spice. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-medium carbonation, oily and a little syrupy, mouth coating it is slightly astringent in the aftertaste. I have long waited to try this beer and was not disappointed. I look forward to the result of aging a bottle of two for several years. I'm glad they finally decided to bottle it.","  rDev 2011 bottle.   Pours a murky light brown with a small and short lived head of foam. No lacing.   Huge notes of caramel in the smell. Sherry and some fruity aromas.   Caramel taste up front but not as sweet as the smell suggested. Oxidation brings some notes of Sherry more than Port. A little bit fruity, a lot boozy but at the same time smooth. Reminds me of an aged Barleywine or Old Ale from the UK.   Full bodied with light carbonation.   I'm pleased.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Stamped bottled on date is '05/16/17'. Medium amber colored body, with some cloudiness. Slight off white head. Left behind are a few scattered, small spots of lacing. Aroma is alcohol soaked pine hops. Reminds me of a port wine. Apricot and pineapple. Sweet malts. Taste is strong with alcohol, and the mouth is quickly dried out with each sip. Good balance between the sweet malts and the bitter, piney hops. Leaves behind a booze soaked dried fruit flavor, such as from candied pineapple and apricot. Has a similarity to a barleywine mixed with port.  Sticky mouth feel, with above medium weight. Has a continuous show of very tiny, rising bubbles, which then sink again and appear as tiny black particles (hops or yeast?). This is a very distinctive beer (going way beyond what  regular  beer is like), with lots of flavors and then the mouth is dried out with each sip. The mouth is numbed somewhat by the drinking experience, but the lingering high and sweet candy flavors never leave the mouth without a lingering taste. Very much a beer for a special occasion, when one has full opportunity to relish all aspects. The high ABV% is certainly a felt effect with the second half of the pour.","  rDev From 2016  A: Poured into a snifter to a deep golden orange that's a little hazy. The beer is topped by a dense finger of off white head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing S: Smells of faded hops with some citrus and pine notes along with a lot of sweetness from the malts. Hints of orange marmalade T: Taste is sweet orange marmalade up front with some pine and citrus along with a strong caramel malt backbone. Slight oily hops with some earthy notes on top of the pine and citrus. Hints of toasted malts in the background as well. On the swallow there's more orange marmalade, caramel malt sweetness, hints of brown sugar, citrusy, piney, and earthy hops. M: This beer is full in body with a slightly syrupy feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low end of things but adequate for the beer given the ABV while the beer has an oily hop finish that's a little drying due to the ABV. O: Overall this is a really interesting beer. I remember this being very abrasive when I had it fresh a few years ago but it mellows out well. This beer is honestly something more akin to an American Barleywine than it is an IPA. It's worth a try if you want to try a very extreme beer.","  rDev De Beershelf. En copa Teku. Viendo Mr. Robo. El alcohol se nota sin molestar, y se sube mucho a la cabeza. Predominantemente maltosa , con notas a galleta,pero el lupulo se nota tambien","  rDev Pours a muddy brown color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. Aroma of alcohol and caramel. Taste of alcohol with a hint of citrus. Easy to drink. Good mouth feel.","  rDev This is a beer I have searched for for a decade. Finding it was anticlimactic: stucck in a mini cooler in an otherwise nondescript beer/wine shop in Germantown. Irony is life.  Pours a dark honey color with a tan head and no lace. The nose is sweet with malt and booze and lots of yeast. As expected, this texture is thick and syrupy but still not quite adequate to protect against the candied alcohol. There are hop notes but the boozy sweetness kind of swallows all the other flavors and subsumes them.   This reminds me of a barleywine or an old ale. A smoothish finish evens out some of the harshness. The aftertaste is big on notes of wood and vanilla. For what it is, an eighteen percent beer with complexity and some balance, this is an achievement. Whether or not it is really an IPA, even a double, is up for debate.","  rDev Happy 60th to me. 60x2=120 seems the perfect time, no? The aroma is good but not great, the taste on this, however, is a Wow!, no doubt.  Clear darker amber with a nice dense head with great stamina (wang dang doodle all night long). The aroma is kinda' sharp almost fusel hop with a rich hop oil quality, that never crosses the line in excess (yah!). Not as complex or fruity as so many other, but for the hops of the time is this quite nice.  The taste. Ahhh, the taste. Rich but not sweet. Solid malt backing contributes to the taste instead of vale to allow the hops to show. Nope rich combination and yet still a hop forward drink, no doubt.  Alcohol has an appearance (rose water and a little perfume) but absolutely no burn. It's quite impressive really.  Lovely finish. Very, very, very, very long laying on the tongue, and a good thing that, but too fast and this will hit good and hard. Pleasing with apparent but not excessive hop flavor, more than bitterness although there is some of that too, and it blends quite nicely. Lovely really. Body is not as big as expected, but smooth it is, with a bit of heat, and soft as hell with excellent feel from the carbonation. Impressive. Better than I expected. Deserves all the accolades it has received. A true ground breaking beer that still holds up well compared to it's followers.","  rDev A - Pours a very dak amber colour witgn a head that dies quickly S - Sweet aromas of molassis and brown sugar T - Well up front its so very sweet and that sweetness just completely dominates everythig M- Mediun body and carbonation O - Maybe aged too long.

Atomic tangerine body with a champagne cap, receding slowly to a fine collar and a modest archipelago in the center. Fine sandy lacing; leaded glass legs; decent retention for the ABV.  Sweet kettle caramelized maltiness in the nose along with some spicy/citrus/forest aromas from the hops. Some candy and white wine notes as well.   Sweet, bitter, and earthy with a deep pervasive maltiness reminiscent of an eisbock though not as dark/roasty. Peppery/grassy hop flavor, though the bitterness and alcohol wins out in the finish which is extremely long and never quite dry. Bears some resemblance to an American barleywine.   Alcohol is certainly present, though never dominant. With the viscous heavy body, this is almost like a carbonated hop cordial more than an ale.   I'm surprised that this isn't more abrasive from all the hopping, but it would make a wonderful winter warmer. Difficult to rate as it goes rather beyond style limitations...","  rDev This boozy brew improves with age. I choked a fresh one down one time, found it drinkable only at 6 months additional bottle aging, and at three years age it was like nectar of the gods! Aged one 4 years and it has lost something so thus far three years is the sweet spot and what I have rated it on.","  rDev Bottled on 11-22-2017 - Consumed on 4-23-19  Pours a nice amber color. 2 finger off white head. The head is quite frothy, which shocks me for such a high ABV beer, and the retention also shocks me. Beautiful lacing on the glass as the head dissipates.  The nose is a combination of a nice caramel aroma mixed in with a pleasing hop aroma that backs it up. It smells like it's become more of a barleywine at this point.  Taste - The hops actually hit me first. Nice pine hop, then the caramel kicks in and mixes well with the hops.  The body is full. I do get some carbonation. Fairly smooth, but there's a slight alcohol burn, but not as much as expected from such a high ABV beer.  This is a solid beer fresh, and, I also know now it's a solid aged beer. I've got 2 more from this date, and will try them over the next few years to see how it ages, but I can say it ages very well.","  rDev 12oz bottle dated 09/14/18 poured into a snifter shows a copper-orange body and floats a thick 1+in head of white foam and leaving spotted and erratic lacing.  Aroma is boozy apricot and peach with a bready malt.  Flavors are led by alcohol, yeasty, maybe sourdough bread, and stone fruits. The bitterness climbs up my olfactory while sipping.  Mouthfeel is soft, full and almost chewy with a sticky finish. Warmth builds in the throat and chest.  Overall wow. Beer, huh?","  rDev UPDATE (31 March 19): No change to anything I have to say about this beer. I still love it and I still think it is damn near perfect. I will, however, mention that after aging one for 14-months the booze is way more pronounced. Yes, more pronounced. I thought it would be tamped down a bit, but after sitting on the door of my beer fridge for all that time I found it boozier than what I remember back in December. Go figure... #NoMatter #ILikeEmBoozy #ILikeEmSluttyToo  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There are times such as these when you wonder why can't all craft be like *this*...  I've had the 60-minute and wasn't much impressed, I've had the 90-minute and loved it, I have a bottle of their 75-minute yet to partake, but this 120-minute IPA lives up to all the hype (and then) some in my book. From the moment you pour it out of the bottle and inspect to that next moment up to your nose, and then the subsequent step of bringing it up to your lips, the whole thing just impresses and surprises one step after the other. A dark orange colored brew with weak foam but some lacing to mention gives way to a uniquely smelling IPA - what I consider and almost perfect blend between the juicy smell one expects and the bitter touch of those hops. Mouthfeel is cream - creamy I tell you! - and that's something I've never experienced with an IPA. And then there's the taste - as unique if not more so to the smell - lightly sweet, incredibly juicy, and at just the right amount of bitter flavor makes this superb. I can see now why people in my circles go ape-shit over this - and I can tell you whenever I can grab one (or two) to take home I will...","  rDev Look: It pours cloudy cooper with an off white head. Head retention is very low.   Smell: It has a strong alcohol aroma. There is a moderate amount of deep caramel with floral and pine.   Taste: It has caramel flavors with some stone fruit, floral, and pine. The alcohol is very evident and strong. There is even a bit of dark cherry way in the background.   Feel: It has a full body that is a bit syrupy in texture. For such a strong ABV, it has smooth alcohol with only a slight hot kick to it.   Overall, this is a wonderfully complex beer that quite favorable with a potent kick."]},{"Name":"Guinness Draught","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/209/754/","Brewery":"Guinness Ltd.","Style":"Stout - Irish Dry","Alcohol":4.20,"Score":81.0,"Comments":["  rDev 14.9oz nitro can into a pint glass.

It's good, but not THAT good!","  rDev The top of a pint can has been popped and the widget is working its magic. The pour into a clear glass Imperial pint mug leaves the look of a classic. This stout is a very dark brown with an enduring tight and slightly biege head. There is only a mild aroma of roasted malt. This leaves as much glass lacing as any brew. The drink is light on the tongue and not particularly flavorful. Roasted malt is the prevalent taste, with just a hint of hoppiness. One of the mildest stouts you'll ever have, likely the original Session Stout.","  rDev Pours a dark brown with thick, creamy head.  Smell is malty with notes of brown bread, coffee, cocoa, leather and a hint of cured meats.  Taste is soft and malty with notes of brown bread, coffee, chocolate and bit of bitterness. Very sessionable.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with fairly low carbonation.  Overall, a classic and one of the most quaffable stouts out there.","  rDev 2020-11-21 14.9oz nitro can served in a pint glass. Somewhat surprised I haven't reviewed it before.  Pours black (really, a very dark, slightly translucent ruby-brown) with a nice, creamy head. I've always found it to be a pretty beer. Smell is mild roasty grains, mild yeast.  Taste is actually richer than I remember, though still somewhat watery. I get some roasty bitterness, maybe some yeast flavor, a nuttiness that makes me think of the shell.  Mouthfeel is very light, thin, and smooth. Overall, it's better than I remember, but still not terribly exciting.","  rDev 11.2oz bottle poured into pint glass... despite the bottle saying  enjoy chilled straight from the bottle .   Draft pour looks much more appealing; yet this is still not an ugly beer. Its hard to compete with that reverse cacase of the nitrogen from the draft pour. Its always memorizing to watch a freshly poured draft pour of Guinness settle into the glass. A dark brown to light black bodied stout with a red hue. A thick off white head that pours 2 fingers tall from a hard pour. That nice light roasty note that is trade mark to Guinness. Light roast and light sweetness that tastes fairly close to what I remember draft Guinness to be (its been over 10 years since I have drank a draft pint of Guiness). Not as creamy as draft pour, but that is to be expected...it came from a bottle. This was way better than I expected out of the bottle. Just doesn't have the magic in the appearance and mouthfeel of a nitrogenated draft pour of Guinness. Still not sure why they want you to drink it out of the bottle...","  rDev I think it’s easy to get lost in nostalgia, ya know? The deep past when things that may have actually not seemed so great, but at the time they did. Your first McNugget, your first tongue twister from what’s her face... And Guinness is kind of that, but I’m not going to do it dirty like that. It’s fine for what is it - no doubt. A bit light, but creamy and smooth (hey, that kind of reminds me of Raul). Yeah, it won’t blow your socks off like 1996 Carmen Electra in a nightie, but it will do the trick like 2020 Carmen Electra in a nightie.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  L9329GH004 3 12:28  The box the cans came in states:  Brewed in Dublin   Appearance: The nitro from the can causes a beautiful cascade of brown bubbles falling to the bottom of the glass. The body of the beer is black and it has a slightly off-white cap that looks laser-cut. The head is short and has very good retention and lacing. It is a very classic appearance.  Aroma: There is very little aroma. There is a light hint of roasted grains with just a bit of carbon.  Taste: There is a light carbon note to the beer and a very light woody character. Very mild roasted grain flavor.  Mouthfeel: It is very smooth and it coats the palate very well. It feels dry and clean with a nice full body that isn't heavy. Very good bitterness.  Overall: It is a easy to drink Irish Dry Stout with a pleasant body and just enough aroma and flavor to keep things interesting. It isn't the most aromatic or flavorful beer but it is enjoyable to drink because as a whole the beer elements all complement each other, with the bitterness adding some quality to the roasted grain flavor and the roasted grain flavor accenting the light carbon aroma. It's worth picking up and I could drink it from time to time.","  rDev From the special edition release can.  Say what you will about the gimmicky nature of it, there is no denying that the 'widget' makes for an absolutely gorgeous glass of beer. A good finger and a half or so of ashy grey head sits atop a cascade effect of nitrogen bubbles racing through the almost-black liquid. Once the cascade is done, you could be forgiven for mistaking the liquid for black. It's not. This is highlighted when held up to the light and you can see a ruby/garnet clear colour, and not just at the edges. That head laaasts too...  Nose is faint, but roasty dry. Some ashy malt and loose grain. Maybe a touch of dull noble-esque hops.   Flavour is dry overall, but with a small glimmer of sweet undercurrent. Thin front half that sells out for the silky mouthfeel, but catches up as it works across the palate, offering roast and ash and a pleasant bitter coffee finish.  Smoothe and silky, though fairly thin (I realize this is partly just a hallmark of the style, but I do prefer a little more chew to my dark beers).  I honestly think that if this beer were produced by more of a craft darling brewery it would get pretty high marks. It's pretty quintessentially the style, and is drinkable and enjoyable. I think working against it are that it's such a mass produced product so it doesn't have the 'intangibles' that might elevate the perception of a smaller breweries offering as well as just kind of the dilemma of dry irish stouts everywhere: they are labelled as a stout, so people (or at least I) instinctively want something big rich deep heavy etc. That's not what this style is. That's not what it's supposed to be. It almost seems to have more in common with like a dark mild than for example a russian imperial. So perception again skews against it.  I dunno. Maybe I'm way off base and just taken in by a neat marketing trick and feeling generous. But I do think that it's essentially the beer that created the style and is an enjoyable enough brew, even if I'm likely to reach for other options over it most of the time.","  rDev From a nitro can. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, almond white foam with excellent retention. Dark malt and light roasted malt aromas. Medium light bodied with a light creamy feel. Dark malt flavors up front that slowly turn roasty. Roasted flavor expands through the middle introducing bitter roasted flavors and charred malt near the end. Finished dryly with lingering bitter, charred malt flavors that slowly fade. Great look and pleasant aromas. Feel is generally thin and the charred malt flavors hurt the drinkability. Their foreign export stout is far better.","  rDev 440ml can with widget. Can states “best poured extra cold”. L: Almost black with deep ruby edging. The widget does its job and the mocha coloured head is thick, creamy and long-lasting. S: Hint of malt but nothing really. T: Characteristic smokey, sweet, dark malt flavour and light bitterness. Long, dry aftertaste. F: Ever so smooth but also a tad thin. O: This is nowhere near as good as the velvety pints of Guinness I enjoyed every Sunday evening at the Prince Christian pub in Windsor (long since gone). As the quality of the beer declined, so the serving temperature was reduced. Still okay but a shadow of its former glory.","  rDev Guinness Draught Nitro, 4.2% ABV. Pours black, with a two finger ivory nitro head. Incredible looking beer. Nose is malt and slight chocolate, taste is malt, slight chocolate, slight sweetness and slight bitterness. Taste comes off pretty bland. Outstanding smooth mouthfeel. Overall excellent, too bad the flavor doesn't match the looks.","  rDev From notes 1/14/13: Pours a ruby tinted brown/black producing 3 fingers of frothy, lasting, light tan head that leaves a thick coating of clumpy lace. Aroma is thin and faintly sour, chocolate, roasted malts with a hint of dark fruit. Taste is a watery version of the nose with a dry, lightly bitter and sour finish which dominates the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and thinly creamy with a peppery bite.","  rDev I've definitely had this in my previous (pre-BA) life, but never since I've been on-site... Totally worth the return... And damn if it ain't better than I'd recalled... Classic cascading pour into a pint finally reveals a pitch-black beer with a creamy almost white foam cap that drags down the side of the glass... Next-level smooth, mild with dark roasty chocolate malts and hints of espresso and char... Mildly sweet, mildly bitter - and, again, so smooth and soft... Probably one of the fluffiest, softest beers... Ratings seem a little soft - I think this beer is exactly what it meant be, and it's a classic Irish stout - and that's how I scored it...","  rDev Pours a pitch black color with a mocha head. smell has roasted malts ,chocolate and coffee notes.

Leaves behind some rings of lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dark fruits. Taste is dark roasted malts, which express dark chocolate and dark roast coffee.

This beer is good for sipping but is really quaffable for such a higher ABV%. Excellent overall and great that it needs no adjuncts to bring forth complex smells and flavors. It's a loss that this is no longer brewed.  Bottle Notes: Brewed in the authentic, historical style of an imperial Russian stout, this beer is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can - and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever-thicker English stouts.

It's chocolate syrup up front, cigar skins in the middle with a little cedary hop and malt acidity, and nutty wafer in the exhale. Its overall bitterness is as pleasantly tempered as it can possibly get at this point, combined with a warming sting on tip of tongue. As it warms, a hint of mocha develops, but so too do notes of Jack &amp; Coke.  The slick but medium body still has a crackly but fine carbonation coming into a powder dry finish.  Other than being nearly still in appearance, I don't know how any signs of oxidation hardly seem to be present here.  ---  Having a 2009 bottle in July 2021, to my surprise I find it a touch more oxidized than the 2008, primarily developing notes of prune and tobacco, while still exhaling wonderful cacao and peanut brittle. It's a dichotomy but it's still overall pleasant, and bitter of mocha liqueur with a finely crisp carbonation.  ---  In late March of 2022, I killed of my last vintage RIS, a 2010--back when bombers of quality RIS were $6.99! While this 12yo does exhibit mild oxidation with some dark fruit and musty cardboard, it is still rather nutty and cedary with touches of cocoa powder and heat. Rating remains unchanged.

Aroma: Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee with some sweet dark fruit, plum, black currant and cherries.  Taste: Similar to the aroma with roasted malts, lightly burnt smokiness, dark chocolate and coffee, followed by dark fruit sweetness of plum and prunes.

Aroma hits hard in the alcohol, roast and chocolate malt category.   Taste makes me think it is more on par with an American Imperial Stout moreso than Russian, the dark fruit notes just aren't there, the hopping is pretty damn big, so you get more of a hop based bitterness opposed to the yeast in a Russian version. This stuff is so chewy and covers the alcohol so nicely.

Smell is initially boozy, but notes of unroasted coffee beans, roasted malts, dates and prunes come through. Unique smell for a Imperial Russian stout.  Taste is roasted malts with notes of dates, prunes, giving way to a bitter finish that has some notes of what I can only describe as black licorice. Not a ton of sweetness in this, and its pretty dry. Bit of a boozy flavor coming through on the back end. Nice balance between the flavors and bitterness even if it comes across as a bit hoppy for a Russian Imperial stout.  Feel is very hefty but smooth. Mild carbonation, but the boozy finish keeps a nice tingle on the tongue.   Overall a very good beer from Stone, but not the best example of the Russian Imperial Stout. Still a very good beer in its own right.","  rDev Had it on tap at Beer Shop and Tasting Table NYC. It poured a dark and thick black with a nice tan and mocha colored head. The aroma is comprised of mostly of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and alcohol. The taste aligns with the aroma. Overall, a chocolate sweetness coats the tongue. This is balanced by a slightly bitter roasted malt and coffee, as well as an alcohol finish that also has a bit of licorice. This beer truly has great balance; sweet but not cloying, bitter but not astringent, alcoholic but not boozy. My favorite thing about it is the feel. It is full bodied but bordering on medium, thus, making it extremely drinkable. I had the pleasure of drinking KBS the night before and it was interesting to compare these two.

Even if you don't like it, the experience shouldn't be drawn out. Concern arises as a deliberate pour into a clear pint glass produces a puffy white, but disingenuous head. It recedes quickly and unevenly. It's not pretty and this character often forecasts a body that will be too light. The color is pretty nice. It's a light copper-amber with a density about halfway between opaque and translucent. A fair amount of lacing graces the glass where the head has mercifully subsided. Aroma?, at best a little Belgian yeast can be detected. Despite some warning signs, this tastes pretty good. It does indeed have sufficient body that's in great balance with the malt, hops, yeast and alcohol balance. With each sip, or gulp, you can get all four sensations, with the alcohol never taking precedence above the others, despite the relatively high ABV. Light but richly flavorful and for a Belgian Ale, not close to being overly yeasty, this is a delightful brew to consume.","  rDev Pours a golden straw color with well over two fingers of head. The nose has that classic Belgian funk. The flavor is funky, herbal and oddly sweet. The body seems spot on.

Loaded with banana esters, pepper, baking spices, and citrusy hops. Not much malt present in the aroma, but what's there smells lightly sweet and doughy  The taste up front is a perfect balance of spice and citrus, very bright and lemony. The citrus fades a bit after the swallow, giving way to even more spice and bubblegum like esters with just a touch of grassy hops  This drinks wayyyy lighter than 8.5%. The body is medium light and the carbonation is intense and effervescent, making this straight up crushable for the abv. Finishes mostly dry but still coats the mouth to remind you there's some strength  This is amazing stuff right here, it's the standard for a reason. I see no reason to drink a different Belgian pale (though I still will)","  rDev Drinking this at home. Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle In to a pint glass. Appears golden yellow with a nice foamy white head that lasted longer than any head I've seen poured from a bottle, and settled to a nice thick foamy head that lasted. Smells strongly picking up a wonderful aroma while pouring, malty, yeasty, citrusy. Taste follows the nose, with spiciness, yeast and maltiness. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall, not at all boozy for an ABV of 8.5. This is the highest rating I have ever given to a bottled beer. I'd love to try it on tap. I would definitely drink again.","  rDev Poured from a bottle -clear gold straw color with huge foamy head leaving a glass coating amount of foamy lacing. Nose is spicy and yeasty. Taste follows with hints of citrus although a bit more subdued. Highly carbonated with a dryish finish. Reminds me of an adventure in Belgium a long time ago.","  rDev Look: It pours golden and clear with a light head. It has very tight beading in the head with very good head retention.   Smell: It has a spicy start with pepper and coriander. There is a low level of lemon in support. There are also low levels of earthly elements as well.   Taste: It is well spice with pepper and coriander being the most prominent. There are earthly and doughy elements in support. There is a bit a lemon very low in the background.   Feel: It has a medium light body in spite of the alcohol content. There is as much of a spicy bite in the finish as there is bitterness. It also has the classic dry finish.   Overall, a great combination of complex esters and other elements.","  rDev a: clear golden amber color with some light yellow in there. massive, 3-4 finger rocky and froth white head  s: huge note of lemon, lemongrass, and barnyard funk upfront. sweet grass and grains behind that with green apple skin and pear. huge Belgian yeast spice in here - clove and cardamom galore. earthy, herbal sweet grass and huge dry crackery notes. big esthers and yeast in this  t: big punch of flavor upfront. green apple skin, sweet grains, and alcohol upfront. a slight funk with cloves behind that. lemongrass, pepper, and a mild earthy hoppy bitterness. sweet biscuits and red peppers behind that. the finish on this is some sweetness, along with more green apple and Belgian yeast  m: heavier side of medium mouthfeel with high carbonation  o: a benchmark of the style for sure. it has the flavors, aroma, and appearance that you think of when you think Belgian Strong Pale Ale","  rDev  ... the devil doesn't come dressed in a red cape and pointy horns. He comes as everything you've ever wished for ...   Review #1,000! Only took me the greater part of a decade . Here is a big cheers to the next 1,000!  Enjoyed with proper Duvel glassware  A timeless classic. The consistent quality of this brew alone deserves to be lauded.   Depending on your experience/conditions the Duvel pours a semi-clear and effervescent straw gold body. Some cloudy yeast sediment can be experienced resulting in darker hues. Signature Duvel look in its excitable frothy head of snowy white peaks that really take on a life of their own. Some of the best lacing work you will experience in a brew here. The nose is yeasty spice bread, golden grains, tart green apple, and a light lemony citrus with mineral water. Very clean. The flavor of this is a golden malt delight; so well balanced and dangerously drinkable. Earthy yeast, grassy green hops, golden wheat/malt/grains, and some granny smith apple with mild alcohol spicing. Very dry and creamy in texture with a prickly high carbonation feel.  The devil comes in many forms….I definitely prefer the Duvel fresh as the hops have way more pop. Vibrant and crisp, but this does stand up well to cellaring. I have had a 4-5yr old bottle and with age this brew becomes more white wine and vinous like. The lively yeast and green hops have now mellowed giving stronger expressions of more golden stone fruit and white grape flavors, super creamy texture, and a touch of oxidation.    O thou invisible spirit of ale. If thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee Devil... ","  rDev On tap at Haven in Orange, CA.  First things first, I wish this beer was a lot warmer than how it was served. That being said, Raul has learned in life that beggars cannot be choosers. Anyway, it pours a basic, straw yellow like a cow gnawing on hay. Aroma is of faint Belgian yeasts like a stroll in the city Bruges. Taste is a bit light (which I’ll blame on how it was served). That being said, it’s still pure and clean like the captain of the cheerleading squad before the quarterback tainted her.  Yep!","  rDev Pours a lighter yellow color with a huge, rocky, thick head that fades to a soapy looking island of foam that lasts almost to the end of the glass. Spicy, effervescent, a pretty interesting taste going on here. Slightly sweet with a lingering hoppiness that's not quick to fade. An excellent and satisfying beer with a unique taste.","  rDev How have I not reviewed this?! It's one of the most classic styles in existence! Reviewed as part of BJCP training, 25C Belgian Golden Strong. Pours a giant foamy 2+ finger rocky mountain-like head that fades slowly, nice soapy lacing, crystal clear medium gold color  Nose malt brings a mild toasty sweet grain, golden Belgian malt but mostly enough to prop the rest of the beer, fair amount of fruity esters, mild pome fruit like, some baked apple, mild spicy phenols, a mild smooth perfumey alcohol,   Taste fruit out front, baked apple and some pear, nice fruity esters, mild peppery phenols and perfumey alcohol again as well as a mild spicy alcohol, some spicy hops in the middle, with moderate bitterness, a sweet blond malt, toasted grainy sweet malt, a little sweet but not quite candy like, a little citrus and lemony note as well, lingering bitterness with a mild dry finish,   Mouth is medium bodied, very high effervescent carb, only a touch of warming alcohol  Overall classic to style, more bitter and spicy than I remember, but still tasty","  rDev How have I not reviewed this before? This my standard every single time I'd visit the Kebab Factory 12+ years ago. This 33cl bottle dated 04-2020 I picked up at a supermarket here in Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Served in a tapered tumbler. Beer is extremely pale, even for a BPA, and could be mistaken for a Corona -- or as it's known around here, Amstel Bright (except it's in a glass). This one at least forms a nice white lacy head.  Aroma is floral from a combination of hops and yeast. Flavor is harsher/stronger than some Belgian pale ales, with a yeasty bitterness, aggressive carbonation over a creamy body, and orange pith. Good flavor, good style, and wide availability make this a winner, but in my opinion there are plenty in the same genre which are more remarkable: Delirium Tremens, La Chouffe, or my personal favorite, Southampton Grand Cru.","  rDev Pours a clear, pale straw coloration with visible coloration and a large, foamy/creamy head. Smells of light biscuity malt and fruity esters of green apple, with just a hint of citrus and mellow funk coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with the fruity and mildly tart apple/pear and just slightly peppery yeast esters in the foreground, complemented by citrus notes, light biscuity malt and just the merest hint of mellow funk. Finishes with a very light bitterness and a very mild funky tartness lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  First off, it's incredibly how easy-drinking this is at 8.5% ABV, with a great balance of mildly tart and spicy fruit esters, citrus notes and very mild funk.","  rDev L:. Pours a straw gold yellow with a small white head and no lacing.  S:. Fresh baked bread, Belgian yeast, lemon, some peach and a slight bit of orange. Very inviting.  T:. Strong Belgian yeast with clove and coriander mixes with a slightly orange and lemon, some fresh baked bread and a slight funkyness. Booze is slightly noticeable wonderful taste.  F:. Medium body and generous carbonation.  O:. This beer is an absolute classic.","  rDev From notes 4/9/12: Pours a clear medium gold producing a tall, frothy, very persistent, white head which leave chunky and sticky lacing. Aroma and taste: Belgian fruity esters of apple, pear and white grape, light Belgian funk, pale malt and spice with delicate hop hints. Alcohol is noticeable in both nose and mouth. Medium bodied with abundant carbonation, lively in the mouth.","  rDev Poured from fridge temp and allowed to warm. Pours a nice deep yellow with a considerable amount of white head. This was an aggressive pour. Nose is really unique and nice. Lots of citrus peel, pine, wheat, and a bit of funk. Getting a bit of lactose as well. Maybe a bit of leather. Taste is crazy. Definitely a bit bitter up front. Good amount of wheat, pine, and citrus, but man there is a good amount of bitterness. Really get the feeling I'm sucking on grapefruit peel. I like it. Mouthfeel is dry and sticky. Overall, fantastic golden ale.","  Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. Best by date is '06 2018'. Clear golden colored body. Lots of pillowy white head. Good web lacing coverage in the glass. Smell of citrus/lemon, along with apple/pear. Some yeast funk. Taste is yeast esters, combined with cracker, lemon and apple/pear mid way, and sweet at the end. Refreshing, light mouth feel. Good carbonation level. Unlike most U.S. made beers; it shows its confident and well established brewing history with each sip. Where else does one find the billowy white head with each pour from the bottle. Not extremely complex aroma and tastes but extremely well done.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a lovely clear golden color with a beautiful white head. The head sticks around for awhile. The nose is a bit of citrus. The mouth gets the lovely crisp flavor of a bit of malt and some hops. Yum!  The 2020 gift pack includes a very nice glass!","  rDev Finally reviewing this one, bottle BB 12/2018: Pours a lovely golden with a light chill haze (and yellow with a murkier haze if proper decanting is not done). Of course, the cumulonimbus cloud of white head is a well-known property of this beer. This falls into rocky peaks in an interesting near-geologic study. Lacing isn't as heavy as expected, but is quite strong.  The nose is a nicely balanced combination of sweet-leaning orchard fruit and a grassy to very lightly piney hop note. There's not much more complexity than that, but that simple recipe is very enticing.  Taste starts with a light, white cracker malt note. Upon this is layered a thin spread of apple butter. This provides the base upon which a spritz of citrus is added (with a little more tang when the dregs are included). The carbonation isn't as powerful as expected, but is in multitude with each sip. This might aid the pepper notes that come on as we transition towards the back of the beer. The orchard fruit becomes citrus pith as the bitterness starts to gain, combined with the pepper, there's a combined zesty bitterness here.  No surprise, just a well put together pale ale that is medium dry in the end. No frills because none are needed - a moderately complex beer without any extremes.","  rDev Pale golden body with lots of carbonation; frothy, sticky, sculpted head. Excellent fruity aroma; notes of pear and grapefruit. Beautiful light malt backbone with a light, estery flavor; alcohol builds up slowly yet never overpowers the overall taste; very subtle sweetness off-setting the hops and alcohol. Relatively light body; powdery; dry finish overall.  This is a strong beer with character. It exudes a kind of lightness in mouthfeel while also delivering a lot of depth and balance with great flavors. Well-rounded, easy drinking (for a relatively high ABV), and quite satisfying.","  rDev ** 10/19/17  I know I've rated this before, but lost it somewhere on a previous spreadsheet. Here goes again.  Bottle to snifter.  LOOK: Light yellow; big foamy head. AROMA: belgian yeast, esters, touch of citrus, touch of banana  TASTE: balance of hop and malt, touch of banana with the yeasty flavors. FEEL: thin body, but a sturdy head keeps it creamy, excellent carbonation.  A classic. I think I can appreciate this more now. Still not my type of beer, but you can notice attributes here that are similar to great heavier belgians.  **","  rDev Just slightly hazed gold with a finger of white head that leaves decent lacing.  Lovely, skunky barnyard aroma that continues to the taste with a nice blasts of Belgian yeast and a slight black pepper.   Medium bodied, slightly prickly.

This makes for a superb, rich and complex Belgian Strong Ale with an excellent balance of sweet and just slightly roasted and bitter notes, as well as a great body and mouthfeel. The focus is clearly on the malts and esters here, with a rich bready and caramel presence and distinct notes of dark fruit and spice, while subtle hops add just a touch of earthy, bitter notes to this that balances it out very nicely.

Caramel, black pepper, mild clove &amp; mild banana flavors.   Robust but accessible; damn good!","  rDev Bottled 5/28/21  So, this is something of a classic beer we have here.

Realistically I could have found it at a different store closer to me, but I figured I might as well grab it anyways. I'm thrilled to try this one  Pours an opaque deep brown with 3 fingers of fluffy light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  The nose here is intoxicating, if not a bit simple for what it is. I'm picking up on aromas of plump raisin, brown sugar, overripe banana, brown bread, and toffee  It's definitely more spice forward in taste, but finds a nice balance between spice and fruity yeast. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark malt, black pepper, rich caramel, plum, and a touch of earthy hops. The swallow brings it back to more familiar territory, bringing notes of raisin, apple skin, toasted malt, candi sugar, and a touch of clove  A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a surprisingly refreshing and light beer for the abv.

Two fingers of off white head, which sticks around as a thick cap. Some partial lacing sheets left behind. Aroma of Belgian yeast, caramel malts, and raisin/date dark fruit. Taste is initially sweet with the caramel malt, followed by the dryness of the yeast. The raisin and date flavors swirl throughout. Kind of dry at the end, which follows because of the higher ABV%. Thicker mouth feel with the drying tug. Good carbonation. So good as an exploration into the Belgian yeast, with the other rich flavors of caramel and dark fruit. Easy to drink but conducive to sip and savor. Tastes Old World-ly and free of gimmicks and tricks.","  rDev L- Quite deep chestnut brown, pours slightly hazy with 1Cm pale tan head. S- Quite deeply malty-rich. T- Very Belgian Dark. Deep, quite pungent, deep rich malts, some liquor-ish edge which is hardly surprising given it's 9%ABV. F- Rich deep and pungent and yet very smooth. Would make a great winter-time slow-sipping beer for the evening, or to accompany dessert. O- Very nice, nothing seems at all out of place though overall it's arguably a bit of a blunt instrument which would benefit from more definable characteristics. The ABV% is also arguably a bit loud-and-proud given the 9% here is pretty full-on, but shouldn't be coming over as quite such a boozy brute. 330ml bottle Bought from BeersOfEurope/UK for home delivery.

Dark, dry pitted fruit flavors reminiscent of figs and dates; candi sugar; minor presence of alcohol; rye-like malts. Heavy body; soft and velvety; outstanding residual sugar body; semi-sweet mouthfeel offset with a touch of boozy warmth.  Opening the chilled bottle produced a minor gusher, but not too much beer was lost. The smell wasn't very strong but yielded some soft and varied elements.

Taste is sweet and malty with some hop bite  Low carbonation  Light mouthfeel  Not a huge fan of this style and this beer didnt do much to convince me otherwise","  rDev L: Pours a dark red purple mahogany color with a small brown tan head and no lacing on the glass.  S: Sweet molasses, caramel and cherry, a slight note of burnt sugar. Some toffee, smells very malt without much hop. Also smells very inviting.  T: Molasses, caramel and toffee, slightly tart cherry, a burnt sugar that adds a slightly off putting bitterness. Not as big of a fan of the taste as I am of the smell. It is still pretty good but a let down after the aroma.  F: Medium body, not quite as heavy as I expected but still work.  O: Great aroma, flavor not quite as good but still a solid beer.","  rDev Bought at Supermarket Liquors in Fort Collins. Bottled October 18th 2018.  Pours a dark reddish brown with an off white head of foam, nice lacing.   Smells of burnt brown sugar, caramel malt, toffee.   The taste is burnt brown sugar which gives it some bitterness, caramel malt brings the sweetness, toffee, maybe some vanilla, kind of toasty.   Fairly light bodied with lightish carbonation, finish is decidedly burnt and bitter.   Not much alcohol interference, still a sipper that I enjoy.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Label has bottled on date as '06.05.18'. Deep amber colored body, with ruby red highlights when back lit. One finger off white head sticks around as creamy cap. Leaves behind a scattered pattern of lacing spots. Aroma of roasted malts and caramel/toffee. Whiffs of dark fruit, smoke, peat, and hops. Taste is sweet caramel and toffee malt, with the additions of smoke, prune, peat. Has some floral hops floating in the background. No bitterness, no char. Fuller mouth feel, with good carbonation. Yummy beer for in front of the fireplace, but it is sweet. Good enjoyment in the mouth, and brings up images of wind swept Scottish islands.","  rDev 12oz bottled 6/5/18 (72 days ago) poured into a thistle glass at fridge temp 8.5% ABV 50 IBU. The beer pours bright medium brown with ruby highlights. The head is light brown and quickly falls to a few bubbles. The aroma is strong with malt (burnt sugar, earth, toffee). The taste is semisweet caramel with an earthy, medium bitterness. There are hints of peat and alcohol that poke through as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry in the finish. Overall, very good. Certainly a first place for value. Recommended.","  rDev Very nice, smooth scotch ale. Nice dark brown color with small amount of tan head that fades. Minimal lingering lacing. Smells faintly of scotch and raisin. Tastes of raisin, plum, scotch, caramel and malt. Mild alcohol taste throughout, quite well hidden. Smooth, mild mouthfeel with no bitter aftertaste. Maybe a tad sweet but still great when paired with dinner.","  rDev ** 04/25/18  bottle to tulip glass.  LOOK:Dark brown with the slightest maroonish hue. Healthy off white head, fades to a small lasting head. Great retention.  AROMA: grape, barley, touch of wood and/or smoke. TASTE: Raisin, plum, brandy, bread, fruitcake. FEEL: Medium to full bodied. Creamy and very smooth.   One of the better scotch ales I've had.   **","  rDev Hot damn, we have ourselves a winner here, my children. Rich and velvety like Emily Rarajkowski popping out of a cake, I’m feelin’ this one. Smooth scotch flavor, smooth malts... can I say yes please?","  rDev 355ml can. L: Dark brown, lots of suspended sediment, thin head disappears quickly but leaves lacing. S: Rich, sweet &amp; malty. T&amp;F: Follows the nose. Wood, malt, treacle, hints of whisky barrel, smooth, soft, lightly drying, warming alcohol in the finish. O: Excellent winter warmer. Almost hides the alcohol. Way too drinkable for 8.5% ABV...! Super smooth.","  rDev Bottle from Boise Co-op. Dark, ruddy brown, small spotty head. Big earthy, peaty aroma. Taste is malty, peat, chocolate, roast grains,. Lingering bitterness. Nice body too, velvety, rolls over the tongue.","  rDev Pours a deep, dark amber coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smells of caramel, bready malts, dark bread and a hint of dark fruit and booze. Taste follows the nose, with a strong malt presence dominated by caramel, bready malt and notes of toffee, dark bread, dark fruit: fig, raisin, with a hint of smoke and chocolate. Some earthy, bittering hop notes in there as well. Finishes with a medium, but kinda harsh, boozy bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation. All in all, this is nicely balanced, albeit maybe just a hint too sweet and boozy.","  rDev Pours a very dark reddish brown, with fine foam.  Smell is sweet, with figs, caramle and raisins leading the way, and some leather and brown sugar in the back.  Taste is more bitter than expected, fruity with plenty of figs, caramel and a hint of resin. Gets sweeter as it warms.  Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated.  Overall, a really good Scotch ale, a little bit underwhelming on the nose.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Dark red brown with thick off white head and good lacing. Nice malt nose. Taste is sweet, malt, biscuit, dark sugar. Complex taste. Very good!","  Orange brown color,medium carbonation and bidy,maybe leaning just a bit towards being thin. Aroma is malt,roasted malt,roasted nuts, brown sugar/vanilla. Taste is pretty much the same,a little sweet but also has a bitter finish that lingers. Haven't had a scotch ale in a long time as it's not my favorite style but this was definitely worth trying and I'm glad I did","  rDev Look: It pours dark brown and it is fairly clear. It has a tan head with low head retention.   Smell: A full malt aroma, complex and inviting. It has some caramel and moderate smoky elements. The are also low aromas of alcohol as well.   Taste: There are flavors of caramel and nuts. There is a low roasted character to it with low smoke. There is moderate bitterness and a very low dried fruit (Plums) element.   Feel: It has a moderately full body with some alcohol warmth.   Overall, a complex malty beer that highlights malts with a bit of light smoke. A great drinking Wee Heavy.","  rDev First had at Huckleberry's Pub, Mounds, the middle of nowhere in southern Illinois, poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped  BOTTLED ON 01/17/17,  into (unfortunately) frosted tumbler. Not overly Scotch-aleish, but very malty.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; bottled on 3/1/17.  A: Pours a clear, dark copper color, almost like black coffee, with a more than one inch, tan head. Good head retention and Belgian lacing.  S: Aromas of Irish whiskey and brown rum, cocoa/mocha and dark bread rind.  T: Sweet with flavors of molasses, unsweetened chocolate, and fig/raisin. Modest bitterness in nice balance revealing pleasant sweetness with a crisp finish  M: Medium to full bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy. O: An excellent, uniquely American interpretation of a Scottish Ale. Toward a porter/stout and worth trying.","  rDev Nice scotch ale but this is not my favorite style. A lot on the cocoa powder, some floral hops, hints of smoke and some notes of figs and dates. Nice smooth body.","  rDev L: Pours out a dark reddish brown that looks almost black in the glass; black in the middle with tints of ruby red at the corners. The head was huge, foamy, and tan. Retention was medium-poor, the head dying away fairly fast, but a thin tan ring remains and leaves some sticky lacing.  S: Rich dark malt complexities. Gingerbread, pumpernickel bread, fruitcake, molasses, chocolate, licorice, anise, black cherry, date, fig, and raisin.  T: Huge gingerbread, pumpernickel bread, toasted brown bread complexity, with hints of peak smoke. It's sweet and very dark fruity. You get molasses, a bit of licorice and star anise spice, along with notes of dried black cherry, date, raisin, and fig. Some dried tobacco as well.   F: Smooth, moderately carbonated, well-rounded to a degree that compliments the rich breadiness of this fine ale.   O: A damn fine scotch ale. Smooth, bready, sweet, and packed with flavor.","  rDev Pours a copper color with a foamy tan head that disappears quickly. Aroma is chocolate. Tastes of caramel and chocolate. Finishes sweet. Good mouth feel.","  rDev Dark ruby red gold color with light tan cap.  Aroma led by the scent of wild black cherry. I kid you not, that's what first lept out of the glass. Followed by roasted, coffeeish malt, Dark chocolate and a sense of dryness.  Taste is Belgian Quadlike, big, strong, bold and rich. On entry the roasted malt is primary with chocolaty coffee and dark tree fruit (cherry) trailing not far behind. Each time I raise the glass I'm greeted with the cherry/fruit scent first but don't actually taste those as strongly until the aftertaste where they linger.  Texture is full, chewy, creamy and denser than Army coffee.  This is big rather than complex with strength of character rather than finesse. The 8.5% alcohol is well hidden and not disclosed in either scent or taste. I don't know where the 50 IBUs went, I didn't see 'em, perhaps a slight tingle in the aftertaste but I wouldn't bet on it. For such a big flavor as this one carries hops are window dressing anyway. There are enough in there to balance things out. This is the culinary equivalent of a big hunk of meat hot off the grill.","  rDev Dark brown with two fingers of tan head that leaves light rings of lace as the level drops. Smells light dark brown sugar. Maybe a touch of licorice. Taste is molasses dark chocolate some dark roasted coffee. A light touch of licorice also. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation level. Finish is lightly dry and mildly bitter. Overall big an tasty beer.","  rDev 12 oz bottle poured into a teku glass. Pours a 2inch head fading quickly.  Smells like chocolate and rum, taste caramel with a hint of chocolate.  An excellent Scotch Ale/wee heavy. Hard to find in Europe but totally worth it.

Thinnest body I've ever seen in a double IPA.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Cloudy orangish yellow with good white head and nice lacing. Fruity and kinda spicy smell and taste. Good finishing bitterness. Nice beer!","  rDev A 330ml bottle with a BB of Feb 2019. Acquired recently from a webshop. Upon examining the label closely, I notice that this is contract-brewed by Brasserie St. Feuillien in Belgium. The label mentions that this has five layers of hops: Columbus, Cascade, Centennial, Simcoe and Citra.  A: Poured into an IPA glass. Bottle conditioned. A deep orange-amber colour with intense carbonation and some floating sediment. Yields a huge head of creamy white foam that lasts for a while before slowly reducing to a patchy surface layer. Nice lacing.  S: Aroma of spicy yeast esters with hints of grass/hay, subtle floral notes, vague fruitiness, caramel malt, leafiness and faint pine. Pleasant enough in its own right but not to style. The expected hop character is either missing or faded, while the yeast character seems distinctly Belgian.  T: Tastes of fruity yeast esters with notes of light pine resin, mild weed, a touch of citrus, floral hints, grass/hay, subtle spice, earthiness, caramel malt and leafiness. Pretty dry, followed by a substantial hop bitterness upon swallowing. Again, the expected aromatic character seems to be almost absent.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with spritzy carbonation and good body. Quite astringent; dries the palate. Aftertaste of fruity yeast esters, spice, leafy bitterness, grass/hay, faint fruitiness and subtle malt.  O: Hmmm - not what I was expecting. I can't tell if this is just old or has been made in a way that defies expectations. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are OK but lacking in the hop aroma and character that would usually be present in a DIPA. Nice body. Possesses a decidedly Belgian yeast profile but I don't know if Green Flash originally used a Belgian yeast to brew this beer. So, it might be old or it might be brewed to a different spec from the US version. Anyway, it's a nice enough brew but isn't really to style. Caveat emptor.","  rDev Poured from a single-serve bottle into a simple pub glass.  Pours a fine slightly-hazy copper with a two-finger head and good sticky lacing throughout. A nice-looking beer.  The nose is a nice balance of malt and bitter. The malt backbone is readily apparent and hits first, and balances a strong back-blast of citrusy, not piney, hops. Overall, though, the aroma is perhaps a bit subdued.  The malt spine carries over to the palate, and is a great counterpoint to the undeniable hop storm that follows. Although the hops were almost exclusively citrus on the nose, resin/pine notes creep up on the back of the tongue not unlike a  stealth burn  from deceptively spicy food. There is just a touch of boozy warmth that completes the package. A nice quaff.   The mouthfeel is pretty spectacular. Medium to full bodied (thanks to the strong malt inspiration) but crisp and light nonetheless. Very drinkable, although the ABV will kick your you-know-what if you try to session it.  Overall, this is a very well-balanced IPA offering that I would strongly recommend. I am actually a  late arrival  to the IPA ball, having been put off by other offerings that were trying to win an IBU prize with little nuance. This is a truly-hoppy, yet very drinkable DIPA that checks every box.","  rDev Had on draft at Sunset Cantina.   Look is a deep amber with little to no head.

Really disappointing.","  rDev Poured into a small chalice: color is copper/light amber, head is off white, presenting about 1/2 inch thick then dissipating to a spotty top with a ring on the glass and some spotty lacing on the glass.  Smell is where you want a double ipa to be: emphatic bitterness, good earthiness, solid pine, and great lingering citrus rind.   Taste is similar to the aroma: hop flavors are forward with pine, citrus rind, herbal notes and earthiness; malt is a good backbone but not over done/cloying or missing, solid pale malt all the way.   Mouthfeel is a feature of this ale; big bitterness, solid malt backbone, moderate carbonation.  Overall: a very good DIPA, big hop flavors with a lean towards pine/herbal/floral with just enough bitter citrus rind and maltiness.","  rDev Nice copper/orange hue. Small head about 1 finger.

Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, mild pine.   Pretty consistent when fresh, even these days the mouthfeel starts to have less of a dry malt aspect as it used to, this style just keeps getting drier and drier. But it bursts with hops, they're prolly C hops, simcoe and amarillo. Very good stuff.","  rDev Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a clear bright amber copper with a large white head.  The aroma is a full on rush of hops, pine and citrus. The taste is full of hops and citrus. A world class beer.","  rDev Appearance: Beautiful clear gold with white cap and good lacing.  Aroma: Very piney, citrusy, hop forward.  Taste: Hop forward with malt apparent more in the body than flavor. Malt is there but it's an underlayer. The brew doesn't strike me as very complex but it does have great balance. Clean but long, and I mean long, lingering bitter hop aftertaste.  Texture: Medium to full.  Overall: At 8.1% and 95 IBUs one expects a blockbuster. This one's big, even brawny, but lacking in finesse. The trailer truck load of hops dominate the flavor almost to exclusion of the malt. This is a brew for hop fanciers or those who want to see what a big hop brew is about. My rating is not as high as others because I don't find it anything more than same sorta IPA with more stuffing. More of everything without actually being any more flavorful than standard IPAs.","  rDev Tried this at BJ'S Brewing in Columbus, Ohio. It poured a clear golden with white head that left some lace. The scent had hints of grapefruit and pine. The taste was bitter on the finish but was very drinkable. The Mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's excellent.","  rDev Poured from 12 oz. bottle into IPA glass. It pours a pretty honey-amber color with one finger of foamy, milk-white head and lacing. It smells of malt, light citrus, floral hops, and some sweet, tropical fruit. The bottle is several months old which may account for the fairly subdued hop profile. The taste features a malt base with grapefruit, pine, and a hoppy finish that isn't as bitter as I expected. It's well-crafted and tasty. This ale is medium-bodied, moderately-carbonated, and the 8.1% ABV is enough to give it some oomph. Overall, it is very good. My guess is that, when fresh, the hop profile is more pronounced. If I can find it fresher, I'll try it again.","  rDev Drunk on draught at the Atrincham Belgian bar  Amber clear body with white foaming head  Nice hop forward aroma Not palate scorching but still full on pine and citrus flavour Great stuff indeed","  rDev Clear, light amber color with a thin off-white head that leaves modest lacing. Pine and orange in the aroma. Sweet up front in the taste with a piney, bitter backend and fairly dry finish. Medium bodied. It's fine.","  rDev Euro version.

I'd like to try the Green Flash version  The american version from Green Flash is really better. More bitter with a pungy hoppiness. A real west coast ipa. Very nice in can in november 2019 too","  rDev BJ’s Committed Double IPA on tap in Daytona Beach (FL) where I paired it with a Green Flash West Coast IPA.   Similar in appearance, but the BJ's has a notably better head (retention &amp; creaminess), a deeper amber body that may also be slightly clearer, and leaves fuller lacing   Aroma: more citrus and flowers in the GF; more evergreen in the BJ's. Slight preference for the GF.   Flavor: GF is a tad stronger and more bitter, although the BJ's is not lacking. The BJ's reveals some citrus upon tasting; the GF a good bit of evergreen.   Overall: The BJ's does well, keeping up with the BJ's, although those preferring a stronger, more pungent DIPA will probably prefer the Green Flash.","  rDev Pours - Deep copper color good sized white head that lasts a bit excellent lacing.  Smell - nice hoppy citrus notes I also get some fresh grapefruit.  Taste - Very nice grapefruit and citrus flavors very some and blended bite from the hops excellent balance.  Feel - Medium body very nice clean and smooth.  Overall - An excellent beer I would love to have this again","  rDev From XXXII. In Teku glass. After dinner. Foamy but no geysery. Very balanced and pleasant to drink. Not excessively bitter. More like a high ABV IPA. Goes to the head quick.

It was meant to age, this is telling me. Smells like coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops. Prominent alcohol flavor, even at chilled temps and with the age on it. This was a bad boy back in the day, I bet. Tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating  This is impressive, to be this awesome after 5 years.

It poured an opaque dark with tan head that is leaving some lace. The scent had a mix of vanilla, molasses, cocoa and roast. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip with molasses, cocoa and hints of cinnamon flare. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with smooth carbonation.

Smells of caramel, roasted, almost smoked malt, chocolate and coffee and just a hint of peat and earthy/herbal hops.

Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, peat, chocolate and coffee lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.  A very nice Imperial Stout that features some not too heavy, yet distinct, peat smoke notes along with the roasted, caramel malts and dark, bitter chocolate and coffee, but balanced nicely by some sweeter toffee and dark fruits, as well as bitter, earthy/herbal hop accents. Perhaps not quite what I expected from this, but still quite impressive in its own right, with a perhaps slightly unusual flavor profile and great balance of sweet, roasted, smoky and bitter notes. Quite complex, yet very well-balanced, as I would expect from Founders, with all of the different notes standing on their own without overpowering each other. Mouthfeel is nice and full, but could still be richer and creamier in my personal opinion.","  rDev Medium light carbonation with a just above average body.

Aromas of slight smokey malt, milk chocolate, peat, ash, caramel, grape candy, and campfire.   Flavors are surprisingly smokey, very rauchbier-like, with smoked meats and peat and smoked wood, with some very bitter dark chocolate underneath and fainter tones of sheet metal, toffee, and suggestions of dark fruit. Finish of smoke and metal.   Feel is thick and viscous, good alcohol burn, lots of acidity, nice roast.   Overall, I remember liking this beer but not being infatuated with it, however I decided to give it another shot and it's not bad but it's kinda weird. I never got the level of smokiness before that this year's batch brings.   -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-* Original Scores from Jan 6th, 2016 (2015 batch) : 5, 4.25, 3.5, 4, 3.75, total of 3.87 Pours motor oil black. Just black. Black. An angry reddish brown head forms and sticks around for a great while, and lace is everywhere. Hilly and beautiful.  Smells like a Russian Imperial Stout should. Heavy booze, chocolate, charred malts, hop bittering, and coffee at the end of the nose, followed by more booze.   Heavy chocolate notes, with boozy plum and black licorice, raisins, followed with coffee. The booze cuts straight through the flavor though, and burns the profile a bit too much. Some nail polish. Breaths are boozy raisins/grapes and coffee bean.   Feel is huge, dry, and has a sandpaper roughness. None of this is bad, just objective.   Overall impressions : It's not the best RIS I've had, because the booze cuts a bit too much and burns out some of the flavors. Still, it won't keep me from buying a 4-pack in the future. A solid RIS, but maybe a little less enjoyable than Old Rasputin, Expedition, and Plead the 5th.","  rDev From a bottle dated 11/21/19.  Deep cola-brown with 1.5 finger viscous deep tan head. Long-lasting head, with equally persistent 3/4  lacing. When I tilted it back &amp; forth under a light, to get a better look at the color, more head developed, &amp; the lacing grew, rather than dissipated. Phenomenal head &amp; lacing, considering the 10.5% abv, especially as I just took this out of the fridge. (1st time having this - just couldn't wait for it to warm up. :) )  Smell is cocoa powder , chocolate liqueur, (very dense) brownie/cake batter, and peat,roasted malt, &amp; charred wood as it warms a bit. Delicious aroma(s), all-in-all, that just shouts  Drink me! .   Taste is a deep, rounded roasty malt flavor, with a little bit of peat and decayed/charred wood .(Think tree that was hit by lightning 5-10 years ago. ;) ) Some dark, semi-sweet....no ....semi-bitter, chocolate notes flitting and dancing through it all. Light pleasant bitterness, that prevents it from becoming sweet. A faint here-&amp;-there tang , as if some sour cream was mixed in the brownie batter. (It's a thing, &amp; it's good.Mom used to make 'em that way, occasionally. :) ) No noticeable alcohol.  Feel is moderately syrupy, initially, then finely creamy as the carbonation kicks in, then finishing with some carbonation tingle on the terminal third of the tongue. That last bit is slightly drying, and prevents too much sweetness. Just the right amount and timing for my taste. +++++ No noticeable alcohol warming, 'til long after it's gone. Then just a vague warm-fuzzy feeling in the chest. +++++   Overall...just fantastic. This is the first time I've had this, and see why it is so sought-after (such that I have never been able to get there in time ;) ) and highly regarded. Call me weird, but some straight imperial stouts, such as this one, are much more satisfying than most of the barrel-aged adjunct/additive-laden ones. Don't try this one....PLEASE!!! - leave more for me! :P","  Bottled 11-6-19. 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip pint glass.  Pours pitch black with a HUGE tan head that cascades alluringly (similar to nitro, but larger bubbles) and takes forever to settle down, requiring several minutes to empty the bottle despite a normal, non-aggressive pour. Aroma and flavor are complex with dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, vanilla, and hints of marshmallow and smoke. Like a s'more...mmm. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and full-bodied. Low carbonation, too low for my preference. Overall this is fantastic but not sure it's a better buy at $13ish/4-pack vs. SN Narwhal at $12/6-pack or Brooklyn BCS for even less.","  rDev Update: Bottled 12/15/14 I had not realized that this beer is no longer brewed. Bummer! So this is my very last bottle of a beer I've had many times but never reviewed. Until now... Enjoyed at the four year mark, 12/25/18. From the bottle this pours thick, begging the comparison to used motor oil. Thin foam, which shows evidence of life. I'm excited to try it!  Even cold it has the most amazing aroma. There's a dark roast, hints of stone fruits, and some black licorice on the back end. Spectacular. Tastes amazing. Incredibly smooth, with everything melding together. This is one for the ages.         2014 Founders Imperial Stout.  Enjoyed with 3 years on it.  Great pour, with a coffee tinged cloud of foam atop a jet black liquid. Pronounced roast, with a strong dark chocolate and long finish. Delicious.","  rDev Bottled 12/15/14; drank 7/11/15 @ the Yarchives.   Inky black appearance.   A rough pour yielded a dark khaki head; minimal lace.   Plum, raspberry, fresh earth &amp; candle wax notes in the nose; wow!   Thick, sticky mouthfeel.   Red wine, bakers chocolate &amp; plum flavors up front; a slightly chalky, dry finish. Faint booze heat emerged as this warmed.   A robust RIS; the nose points to a transcendent future.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Bottling date on label is '12/12/16'. Opaque, black colored body. Two fingers of dark tan/light brown colored head settles back to bubbly, creamy cap. Leaves behind scattered shapes of lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malts, with lots of the chocolate spectrum. Alcohol in the nostrils. Taste is dark roasted malts, with flavors of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Provides hints of char, vanilla, anise, and dark fruit (cherry and raisin). Alcohol is expressed but only adds to the experience (very positive). Fuller mouth feel, with a very smooth texture. Good carbonation. A tremendously flavorful straight ahead RIS, with a soft, smooth mouth texture that calls for long savoring of each sip.","  rDev Outstanding stout that I finally got to try on tap at Founders (since it was recently retired). Thankfully they brought it back, I think, to commemorate the introduction of their new barrel-aged version. This was the 2017 version - likely smoother and more mellow now that it’s aged, although I really have no point of comparison. Pours a deep, dark, rich black opaque color with some great thin tan head and some sheets of lingering lacing. Smells mainly of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, nuttiness and malt. Tastes of deep rich dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted nuttiness, malt, vanilla, caramel and biscuit. Smooth, amazingly full, rich mouthfeel that’s a little creamy and flats the palate well. Good amount of carbonation, just enough. An amazingly delicious beer that’s very easy to drink and well worth all the hype.","  rDev Bottle from Boise Co-op. Silky black pour, minimal head, but skin lasts. Big, full roast grain aroma, coffee, cocoa. Taste adds more of the chocolate, and ramps up the bitterness. Smooth, yet has a nice bite. Velvety texture. Dark and roasty.","  rDev I just drank Founders Imperial Stout, ABV 10.50%, not at Founders, but at Prairie Artisan Ales in Tulsa Oklahoma. The funny thing is that it says it is  retired  here, but the Prairie Artisan Ales staff insisted that it had just been freshly brewed and shipped to them. Perhaps we should ask Founders? Anyway, freshly brewed or not it was a great stout.

It'd be a 5 ... the hops truly are kicking and at times produce a bitter floral bite right up front, then linger as the malt flavor takes over; the wood flavor midswallow ranges from almost raw oak to full-on charred BBQ wood, almost carbon  F: up front it's big and bad, heavy, thick, almost milk stout lumpy, but it smooths nicely into a silky finish; the beer is at least a couple years old but hasn't lost much carbonation, perhaps a little ... there's enough to offer a light tickle that lightens it into that silky feel  O: the load of malt and hops in this sucker is formidable; at times it's as sweet as a stout with chocolate added, other times it tastes like a fresh West Coast style RIS with hops nipping and bitting and generally causing a ruckus; I get why so many pledged allegiance to this brew ... it's as good as any raw RIS I've tried if not better; if Founders brings it back, I'll be first in line to get some ... until then I got two more bottles and will enjoy each and every sip (thanks, Dave!)","  rDev Poured from a single-serve into a stout goblet.  The beer pours with a viscosity that deserves a motor-oil-like designation and that's high praise for the style. An espresso-brown head that dies somewhat quickly, but gives way to as persistent a lacing as you could ask for. Such a dark brown that were it not for the tan head, it would look black. Exceptionally opaque. I rarely give  5's  on anything. This is a brutally beautiful beer.  Dark coffee/espresso and bitter chocolate rule the nose with boozy/fruity sweetness in the background. Well balanced.  Flavors, like the nose, are bold and straightforward. Classic bitter coffee and dark chocolate with a little bit of cherry and dark-fruit sweetness in the background. Excellent char flavors without getting to toasty. Astringent at the finish but not in an off-putting way.  As full-bodied and chewy as you could ever ask for, the carbonation and booze (which is well-hidden by-the-by) help it from being undrinkably heavy.   I've had this brewer's Breakfast Stout many times, and passed this one by because of how much I liked that offering. Big mistake. You must try.","  rDev From Mikkeller Shop. In Teku glass. Watching Looper. Amazing in all aspects. Thick, with a delicious dark fruits profile. I found myself drinking it in small sips so that it never ends","  rDev 12oz bottled 11/30/16 poured into a pint glass at fridge temp 10.5% ABV. The beer is as close to black as it can be with abundant chocolate colored head and close to 75% lacing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, dark malt and faint tobacco take turns appearing as the beer warms. The taste starts with semisweet dark malt, moves to dark chocolate and finishes with the rich tobacco note. Bitterness is a function of roasted malt more than any detectable hop presence. Mouthfeel is fantastic. It's soft with adequate carbonation, full bodied and finishes cleanly with no cloying qualities. Overall, excellent. I've had a lot of RIS but this is in the top two for me in terms of quality for price.","  rDev Black color with a two inch ochre head. The head dissipated quickly. Aroma of booze and roasted malt. Better taste. Still very boozy, but there's coffee and chocolate there, as well as some charcoal. Big-bodied, dry.","  rDev 12oz bottle, bottled 12/02/15, poured into a pint glass is black as night --the only color showing through light at the edge being a reddish cola color-- is bald, or headless. It just looks odd. Aroma is all booze at first, but then stone fruit, roast coffee bean, and oak join. Flavors match with a bitter hop touch at the end after the booze clears the pallette. As the beer warms to room temperature the booze comes on stronger and lasts through to finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and an oily finish. Still pretty hot for 16 months. Two more in the beer corner for the future.","  rDev i'm a big Founders fan, but not so much of this offering...  Out of the glass it looks great (and what a great start) - pitch black liquid leading to a dark tan head and lacing that sticks well to the bottom of the pint glass. The smell is a nice blend of booziness and distinctive stout odors that simply made my mouth water from the get-go. But here's were things went a little wonky for me. Though the mouthfeel was full-bodied and rich, there was enough carbonation to distract from the overall experience, then the taste was, well, less than great. In fact, it was by far the booziest imperial stout I have ever had - at least it tasted that way, and I've had stronger ones than 10.5% ABV. The booze flavor simply overpowered whatever else they were trying to do with this. I am a someone who leans towards these, but I'm looking for more complex and well-blended flavors, rather than a short of bourbon or whiskey in my beer. Anyway, it wasn't awful, just not something that tingled my toes. Overall, I like the beer, I'm sure I'll pick up more in the future, but it certainly isn't on the top of my list for imperial stouts.","  rDev Tasted in a 12 oz snifter from draught at Firkin on April 4, 2017.

Canned 07/06/20. Though a classic of the Rogue lineup, this is my first experience with Dead Guy Ale in MANY years.  Beer is dark orange amber, mostly clear, and forms an ample head. Flavor is moderate, with a chalky hop bitterness supported by a robust German style male profile. I get a bit of banana/clove phenol, maybe attributed to Rogue's yeast? As a beer it's just ok, though I do see how it would compliment food.

Some hopping holds up well to the sweetness, hopefully that comes through in the taste  Heavy on the malt as I expected, but I am pleasantly surprised how the hops work here, crushing the initial attenuated sweetness into bitter territory, before bringing it back to a flavorful and sweet toasted coconut on the finish, a bit of spice as well. More complex than I was expecting  Medium bodied and rich, this finishes pretty dry for what it is but not overly so, refreshing as all hell  Wow, I'm pretty floored by this one.

Body/Overall: medium body, smooth and silky","  rDev 12 oz. can poured into tight nonic (6/28/2018 born-on date printed on bottom of can)  L: clear copper, plenty of amber in it, short but thick head of offwhite/beige foam; no major sticking or lacing; keeps a consistent collar of offwhite foam  S: barley, grain, musty yeasty grain, sweet bread, peach; as it warms it settles into a dusty peach  T: yeasty earthy hops, peach, orange peel ... plenty of barley flavor throughout; as it warms and the palate adjusts, caramel, lots and lots of caramel  F: fantastic all around, decent carbonation but not too much, nice heft  O: for an 8-month-old beer, pretty dang good ... their might be a hint of metallic can flavor in there, but that also could be from the yeast; the age has allowed the malt to settle in very nicely, yet the earthy bitter hops are having no trouble cutting through and offering a good bite to balance out the sweetness; shockingly quaffable for an almost-7% brew","  rDev Great-tasting, smooth beer that seemed perfect for the fall/winter weather. Enjoyed it on tap at a local restaurant. Pours a nice rich amber color with some mild head and great-looking sheets of lingering lacing. Smells rather faintly of some caramel, spice, hoppiness and a little malt. Taste follows the nose, along with more seasonal spice/clove flavors, caramel, bread and a trace of wood. Smooth, gently rich mouthfeel and good carbonation. A very enjoyable beer and I will definitely try more from this style.","  rDev Pours clear ruby copper color with a nice looking beige colored head that left good spotty lacing.  Sweet and malty, this brew is rich with caramel, brown sugar, toasted grains, syrup drenched bread, tea leaf, floral hops and minerals. Easy drinking and very malty, this is a fine fall brew.","  rDev Medium amber with coppery-red hues and a faint haze in the body, a slim foam head that quickly slipped into a faint collar... Lightly, sweetly bready with a honeyed finish... Little bit of herbal and sweet citrus, like orange, maybe some wood and clove and caramel...Some spice, mildly bitter, moderately sweet... Medium body-weight... Actually pretty enjoyable, but perhaps not something I usually crave...

Nice strong taste, honey comes through well, malt and caramel. Thin mouth feel, easy drinking. Overall good pour.","  rDev Pours a deep amber, very light cloudiness, a thin tan head and little lacing. Smells on the sweet side, bready malts and earthy hops. Tastes of bready malts, molasses, caramel, toffee, raisins and a very mild hop presence on the finish. Medium bodied and carbonated, smooth mouth feel,","  rDev Cloudy dark amber color . Body is just a little thin with just above average carbonation ,overall it was a below average feel . Aroma is a syrupy malty, molasses sugary smell . There is a mild , hoppy, grapefruit aroma that doesnt really fit the rest of this beers profile . Taste is very malty, to the point of it washing out any other flavors. After the maltiness theres a grapefruit mild bitterness that lingers for awhile . Overall it is an okay beer but the dominant maltiness made it difficult to enjoy .","  rDev -deep amber can pour with little visible carbonation. Aroma is of sweet malt and an apple note. The flavor includes caramel and honey with a light hop spice. The flavor is rich. The body is pretty light.","  rDev Served into a 16 oz (473 ml) conical pint glass and Tony C's Sports Grill &amp; Bar in Burlington, Massachusetts. A: Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color with a no more than quarter inch, white head which quickly dissipates to a very large bubble (think soda pop) rim and some soapy lacing. S: Aroma is very limited. Really had to dig for it, but perceived apple, pear, and caramel with maybe (maybe) a black licorice note. T: Dry. Caramel and pear flavors predominate, but really more watery than malty. Licorice bitterness stronger than supported by the level of malt or flavor. Tingling, bitter aftertaste. M: Light bodied with low to moderate effervesce. O: Let me say, this is drinkable, if not by any stretch of the imagination the best representative of the Maibock style. Not malty enough, too bitter, and simply too watery. it were described as a  light  Maibock, perhaps that would make more sense. If it were a soda, one would think it had been watered down. I will try to see if there is a difference when it is decanted from out of a relatively fresh bottle. Really a disappointment.","  rDev On tap at brewery: Deep amber with a chill haze that betrays it’s clarity a tad. Off-white head forms a cap that fades only after I start drinking the beer. Nice lacing that looks like a pile of bones.  Nose has an earthy to somewhat coppery nose that reminds me of an ESB, but with a little more malt and less hop florals. With warmth there’s a dry white grape aspect that comes in.  A clean slightly grainy malt opening, one which brings the earthiness of the nose in early. A bit of dry grass, a hint of dark berry, and an ever so slight tang of metal. The beer leans slightly bitter and is quite clean tasting, medium light gel with subdued but noticeable carbonation.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. No date coding seen on bottle. Pale amber colored body, clear. Slight skiff of off white head and cap after settling. Just a couple of spots of lacing. Rich and inviting malt aroma, and sweeter caramel behind. Taste of malt and caramel, and well balanced. A little sweet with very little bitterness. Malt and hop combine at the end. Sublime. Medium mouth feel, low carbonation. Bright, balanced, hearty, slightly darker ale.","  rDev Pours a hazed, dusty with suspended sediment, deep medium amber producing 2 fingers of beige, frothy, shortlived head that leaves a little webby lacing. Aroma is bready, biscuit malt &amp; fruity, toast, caramel, honey, slight floral &amp; grass hops. Taste is similar but more robust. Toasted bread, biscuit, butter &amp; candied fruit forward with caramel, honey &amp; a more reserved fruitiness from mid-sip through the finish with hops bitterness manifesting nicely in the finish &amp; aftertaste. There is a metallic/mineral hint in the bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, has a slightly viscous feel, slick &amp; coating on the tongue. A legendary beer &amp; always a good choice.","  rDev Thanks to my friend, Cale, for taking me way back to when I first started with craft. It's probably been 8 years since I had this one. 12oz bottle, pours a copper color capped with a foamy ivory head. Sweet malty aroma with toffee, honey, grain and earthy hops. Sweet in taste as well with notes of lightly toasted grain, light caramel, Munich malts, honey, and toffee followed by a modest earthy and white peppery hop bite. Full bodied and creamy with soft carbonation, finishing semi-dry and semi-bitter. Overall, good example of an American brewed bock beer even though a bock is a lager and this is an ale; I guess it works... Rogue Ales .","  rDev Can't believe how many times I've had this and never reviewed it. Weathered orange in color with a light haze. Poured with a short off-white foam with medium low retention. Medium malty aromas with notes of bread crust and sweet grain. No esters or hop aromas. On the heavier side of medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Smooth, slightly oily feel through the middle with pleasant boozy warmth near the finish. Medium high sweet and grainy malt flavors followed by medium, spicy hop bitterness through the middle. Toasted bready malt flavors on the back end. Finished cleanly with light grainy malt notes. Hop bitterness nice balances the malty characters of this brew. A style defining beer and an under appreciated style. Tasty, malty, smooth and drinkable.","  rDev Clear amber with an uneven, short off-white foam settling to a creamy film.  Smell is biscuit, cracker, toast, corn, wood and orange, translating similarly in taste to bread, nut, wood and orange rind, via a frothy, soft, light and dry feel.","  Poured from a can into a pint glass. Deep orangish yellow with a good head and lacing. Smell is grassy sweet but subdued. Taste is malty and a bit earthy. Good beer!","  rDev Rogue's Dead Guy is purty good...  Truly an appealing reddish, rusty color beer. Though there is no head, no lacing, it is still very appealing to the eyes. The smell was boozy - a very nice surprise. Probably the least appealing aspect of this beer was it's mouthfeel, it was light-bodied and supple. I did enjoy the taste with it's light booziness and distinctive ale flavoring. Probably not the best ale I've had but still purty good...","  rDev Amber colour, small head that never fades completely, creamy lace.  Aroma of caramel, nuts, spices, some hops that balance the malty flavour, chocolate. Medium body, creamy texture, carbonations is OK. Taste of caramel, dark fruits, nuts. Really good and easy drinking beer.","  rDev 6.5% ABV.","  rDev Pours an orange tinged brown color. Clear and still. Thin off-white head dissipates steadily leaving no residual head other than a thin ring of foam along the outside of the beer.   Smell is malty forward with some bready notes and a touch of spicy hop. Pretty unremarkable.   Taste is malt forward with some spicy hops. Touch of sweetness to the beer, but just a complimentary amount. Dry finish but its not dry per se. Not sure how old this bottle is, but the hops have held up remarkably well. I'm impressed.   Feel is rather light but not thin, drinkable, touch dry on the finish.   Rogue calls this a maibock inspired ale ... Im not getting much maibock here, so to style, its not a great example. On its own merits, its an easy drinking malt forward ale. I actually enjoyed it more than I expected to given its lack of adherence to the style."]},{"Name":"Hop Stoopid","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/220/35738/","Brewery":"Lagunitas Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":8.00,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Bright foamy white head persists in very good form throughout, leaving excellent lacing.  There is an aroma, pleasant, but hard to describe.  On tasting, it's strong, quite sweet, and although the hops have faded, there is still a hint of clean bitterness. The abv is apparent.   Mouth close to full, finish bittersweet.

Golden colour, large white head. Intense and sweetish aroma of fruity and piney American hops and crystal malts, notes of orange marmalade, pine needles, tropical fruits and grapefruit. The flavour is quite sweet and intensely hoppy, with the same elements as in the aroma. Nearly too much of it all.","  rDev Decanted from a 22 oz (651 ml) bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass; no production data. A: Pours an clear, golden amber color with a two finger, foamy, off-white head, a bit more than rim retention, a finger really, and gorgeously complex rings of lacing all the way down the glass. S: Aromas of caramel, cocoa, and pine predominate. Definitely a honey and sweet tea note. Complex and enjoyable. T: No more than semisweet. Complex with flavors of caramel, pine, honey, and Earl Grey tea evident. Interesting that the cocoa drops out. Peppery and minty finish (but not peppermint). Strong bitterness, but, in spite of its high IBU (102!) feels exceptionally well balanced. M: Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Finishes cleanly without astringency evident. O: Color me impressed. My pour was characterized by strong carbonation, head formation, and lacing. Hop Stoopid is a complex and really enjoyable example of the American Imperial IPA style. Enjoyed it immensely.","  rDev 12 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with a nice off white head. Leaves good lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and citrus aromas, Same as the flavor grapefruit-Citrus flavors. Medium bodied with a dry bitter aftertaste . This is very drinkable for the 8.0% alcohol, one of my favorites.","  rDev From notes 3/12/12: Pours a beautiful and shiny copper, orange-gold producing 2 fingers of frothy, off white, variously bubbled head that leaves thick, sticky lace. Aroma is citrus and pine hops backed by subdued sweet caramel malts. Taste is huge hoppiness! Oily resinous pine with grapefruit, orange and tangerine. Malt is cane syrup and caramel notes. Nicely sweet to help balance and complement the huge hop bitterness from start through aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden. A nice example of the style.","  rDev Up there near super-cluster at similar 8% abv and over-hopped injection. Love the brewer, vow to visit 9/29/19. an explosive, nova of an IPA. a) Slight hazed, brassy, golden body, laden with hop dust, with tight lacing head. s) Splendid honey, melon, citrus, and orange aroma. Big bold tropical, floral forest. A bit of scat fore and aft.  t) Large caramel honey base layer to support the intense, honey-bitter top layers of mango, pineapple, papaya and apricot and ... more... then landing in a juniper, gin martini pucker.  f) As clean as a martini, fresh, dry, cleansing, scrubbing, maintaining the excellence in long flowing after taste again of juniper, lemon, and goose berries. o) As good as it gets. Would like to live near by.","  rDev L: Golden and bubbly - lacy head. Nice.  S: Grapefruit rind and citrus  T: Follows smell, not fruity or even piney - just beautifully bitter  F: Light body for ABV and fully carbonated  O: I've assumed on several occasions that as my taste refined I would grow out of hop stoopid. Each time I've tried it though I was proven wrong. These extracts are no lie.","  rDev Deep golden color, clean and clear. 3/4  white head with very good retention at a thick cap. Plenty of visible carbonation running up. Good lacing. Nose full of grapefruit, mango, onion and garlic. Pungent. Big hop flavors - citrus, mango, lemon, weeds. Creamy, sweet caramel malt base lurking underneath it all. Some dank aromas and flavors in this one. Bright entry, medium body and medium to high carbonation. Good lengthy hop bitterness but stays in balance. Enjoyed it, will try again.","  rDev Poured from a single serve bottle into a tulip...  Pours crystal clear orange with visible carbonation, a limited head, but good lacing. Solid but not spectacular.  The aromas are classic DIPA, although mellow. Grapefruit flesh and zest, mango/guava, floral notes, grass, and white pepper. The hops present with somewhat of an oily aroma.  This DIPA has a strong malt presence at the forefront, but good hop balance. I was expecting more of an uneven hop bomb and was pleasantly surprised by the delivery. The crackery malt seamlessly gives way to grapefruit, pineapple, resin, white pepper, and grass. The ABV is well hidden.  The mouthfeel is medium with a good crisp finish thanks to excellent carbonation.   Overall a solid DIPA.","  rDev 12oz bottled 10/17/18 (67 days ago Chicago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 8% ABV 102 IBU. The beer pours mostly bright honey colored amber with sticky off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is candied orange, tangerine, pine and caramel. The taste is semisweet caramel with a liberal dose of piney bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied and adequately carbonated. The finish is mostly dry, but not sweet, just sticky from the hops. Overall, very good. Classic west coast DIPA. Wish the dates were easier to read and decipher, as this would be an easy repeat buy.","  rDev A clear golden color with slight Amber hues. Chunky seafoam style topping stays afloat with thick, sticky lace all over. An awe inspiring appearance.  This one is fueled by hop extract. Not the actual plant material we all know and pray to. But, it sure does smell like whole cone, fresh hops!!  Sticky lupilin, herbal earthiness...if you've ever crushed up a fresh hop cone in your hands...you know what I mean. A light, herbal and grainy malt thing also is detected in the fine aromatics of this Stoopid ale.  The first sip is just...wow. Soo clean, but wildly complex. The golden ale style malt brings out this grainy and herbal malty flavor that I just love. Clean, but mean. Light bodied feel, crisp with maybe a dash of sweet bread. The malt plays the role of a very flavorful and excellent feeling base, or low end, like a bass guitar. The hops, or the hop extract is the lead guitar, rythm, singer and drummer! It's hard to separate the hop flavors, because it just tastes like a fresh-hop, whole cone style lupilin explosion. 102 ibu's?? There is almost no bitterness...just layers of fresh hop flavor. Earthy, subtle pine, very herbal and  hearty . 8% abv?? Doesn't seem possible. I'm thinking 6% tops. This stuff is Soo damn easy to drink, it's dangerous.   Hop Stoopid....damn. just really impressive how such a complex brew can be Soo easy. I love the earthy and grainy hop after taste and malty backbone. The balance of flavor blurs the lines of tradition and makes it's own, new tradition.","  rDev One of my favorite, if not *the* favorite brewer I have...  ...and what another offering, special, indeed. The coloration is a rustic but light cooperish to the eyes. The beer pours out a white, puffy head and it has really nice lacing all the way down the glass. The smell has strong hints of resin, pine, and some cinnamon - just a light touch of booze, almost non-existent. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied but distinctly carbonated (not something that I gravitate towards), but the taste was an almost perfect blend to what met my nose - with the very distinct bitterness you would expect from something titled with the word  hop  to it. Overall, this is another special beer from what I consider an incredibly special brewer.","  rDev Clear deep golden color with white cap and good lacing.  Aroma of bright, shiney piney hops wit some herbal tones.  Taste of clean piney hops with a surprising kick of something like pineapple or tropical like fruit that's very well comingled with the underlying malt. Not an array of flavors but enough to tell me this is a complex brew. I neither scent nor taste the alcohol and didn't realize it was 8% until I read the description after the review.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.  Whew, of course I was expecting hop flavors but these come across as rather sophisticated in the way they blend together weaving in and out like the strands of a rope with each contributing without competing. A very competent beer that's easy to drink.","  rDev Pours a golden copper color with about a finger of head. The nose has as much maltiness as it does hoppiness. The flavor is well-balanced, which is pleasant. However, I expected a hp bomb based upon the name.","  rDev Golden copper hued body; thick, sticky, rocky head. Piney, spicy aroma. Fine tasteful blend of grainy malt and zesty hop punch and bitterness; plenty of cracker and bread crust. Heavy body; rich and crunchy; some boozy heat and sugary heft.  Ah yeah, a fine - heck, very fine, IPA. It's been around and still delivers a hop bitter, densely flavored punch to the palate.","  rDev Bottle: Lovely clear medium gold, medium-large fluffy white head, nice sheets of lacing early.  Nose is medium brown cracker with a grassy to citrus rind bitterness. A mix of orange/tangerine peel and zest, grapefruit pith, dry grass and pine needles.  More of the bittering agents in the taste, as expected from the 100+ IBUs. The malt comes through from the nose, but only for a fleeting moment. The more piney hop notes rush in with a vengeance. Grapefruit and tangerine ride along the wave of piney-ness. A bit of earthy dank sneaks in the back of this quite crisp, but somewhat biting beer.  A classic that isn't a singular bitter bomb. Bitter, yes, but there is a bit of a classic citrusy/piney flavor profile that gets wrapped by the bitterness.","  rDev L: Clear orange with a small white head that mostly dissipates after a few minutes. A thin ring on the outer edges remains indefinitely, leaving some splotchy lacing down the sides.  S: Big bitter grapefruit peel and orange peel, light brown sugar, catnip, weed, the signature burnt rubber, and soft pine.  T: Big bittersweet grapefruit and orange upfront--white grapefruit flesh and orange peel. Hints of guava, papaya, and mango. Light brown sugar malt, but crisp and not overly sweet. Some dankness, and earthy, woody, bark-like pine. Finishes remarkably crisp and clean, lightly dry, alcohol completely hidden. An aftertaste of bitter orange and grapefruit peel lingers for a few minutes.  F: Medium, well-carbonated, crisp, clean, and lightly dry. Very drinkable.","  rDev A golden color with ample carbonation and suspension. Excellent lacing. Smells light on the hops but good. Very smooth tasting and the hops aren't crazy bitter. It has a smooth mouthfeel and goes down easy. Definitely a class beer that I would buy. From a 22 ounce bottle at BJ's Brewhouse.","  rDev Pours a nice clearer yellow with lots of bubbles heading a off white head that leaves some sheet lace.  Aroma is bright lemon grass, pine , grapefruit some orange notes after it sits a while. Nice bright hoppy brew.  Taste is like the nose bright hoppy citrus, lemon, grapefruit and pine dominating some gassy earthy hints underneath riding and over powering a bready malt base.  Mouthfeel is lighter side with pretty peppy carbonation which probably makes it seem even lighter.  Overall a nice light hop loaded IPA for the summer, wouldn't guess that its 8%.","  rDev A: A golden amber color, mostly clear with a bunch of floaties, and a a large white head.   S: Huge resin and dank aroma with earthy aroma, and a pine resin finish.   T: Tons of resinous hops. Piney, earthy, and dank. A bit of caramel in the finish, followed by a lingering earthy bitterness.   M: Medium in feel, with fairly high carbonation.   O: Overall just a crap ton of hoppy goodness.","  rDev **  06/29/17 Lagunitas tasting with DC.  Bottle to snifter.  LOOK: clear yellow, small but creamy and lasting white head. AROMA: grass, lemon, mold TASTE: mold, grass, sour fruit, sap, wood. Stale.  FEEL: Medium body  In some ways better than born again yesterday, but in other ways not. You can't have it both ways, when you get rid of the bed flavor you also spill out some of the good.  **","  rDev 6/25/17 (Chicago). 12 oz bottle poured into standard pint glass. Blonde clear pour, minimal white head or lacing, mild carbonation. Sweet pine, orange, malt and hops aroma. Very pleasant bitter taste, balanced with the sweet orange pine taste. Strong mouth presence, firm feel, nice drinking. Overall very good beer, glad I picked up a six pack!","  rDev Pours a wonderful orange amber with a large head. Crystal clear (no haziness) but with a lot of floaties. Beautiful hoppy aroma with notes of apricot, citrus and dank. Flavor is definitely danky and very balanced. Medium to full body. A wonderful beer that I need to find more of.","  rDev 12oz. bottle poured into fluted snifter.  Amber, a slight haze but mostly clear. Thick foamy big bubbled head pops itself out into floating islands and thin collar around the glass edge.  I smell resinous and earthy hops, hint of pine and weedy plants. Hint of sweetness and bread dough malts in the aroma as well.  Citrus zest, bitter orange rind, and herbal and resinous earthy hop flavor followed by a hint of pine. Malts come through as doughy with a caramel sweetness that balances everything together. A very smooth and easy drinking DIPA.  Moderate carbonation and hint more body than medium.  Nice and balanced brew that doesn't let the IBUS or late addition hops take over the malts.","  rDev 12 oz. bottle  Pours slightly hazy amber-gold with a dense creamy white foam head.

There is a decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hops bitterness, and earthly grains and malts. There is also a slight sweetness, to the smell of this brew. Now for the taste, it is bold with hops flavors , then it smooths out. There is also a nice amount of grains and malts. I really like the taste, of this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is, it is really hard to pick up on the 8.00% ABV in this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew at all, it has a super nice balance to it. The mouth feel of Hop Stoopid is Hops, Bold, Rich, and Smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely buy this brew again. Lagunitas Brewing Company, did a super nice job with this brew.","  Pours orange with a light frost to it, which is to say, not crystal clear. Head foams up to two fingers in height and in a beige color. Lacing strung about randomly, but lightly. Aroma is well-balanced and tamed hops, with specific notes of citrus, orange, pineapple, and a little pine. Biscuit malts support the hop aroma well. Flavor profile is citrus, pineapple, papaya, orange, with a little pine in the back. Malt notes are carried mostly by subtle biscuit notes, with light notes of bread. Mouth feel is crisp and smooth with a medium to medium-thin thickness. Overall, a sublime edition of a hop forward IPA that refrains from being boisterous or over-compensating. It's easy to drink, and provides a great experience from first pour to last sip. Very nice.  Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev Burnt gold with a uniform soft foam top.  Smell is super dank and pungent with a touch of apple cider vinegar I sometimes get in the Trillium yeast/hop cocktail, with sticky, damp pine cone and orange.  Taste is tangy orange, cannabis, grapefruit, faint bread, and that hint of apple cider vinegar.  Really soft and fluffy but clean and dry. A tasty treat for sure.","  rDev Pours a golden copper color with a quarter inch head that dissipates into a sustained thin cover that sticks around.

Aroma of fruity hops and caramel. Tolerably well hopped flavour, mid between sweet and dry.","  rDev A 22 oz. bottle eventually emptied into a clear pint glass poured out a beautiful golden amber beer. There came with it, a nice bouquet of malts and hops. A small but long lasting white head and some glass lacing completed a beautiful picture. This classic delivers some wonderful balances; between the malt base and hops and within the hops themselves. The result is one of the best standard AIPAs made, although it may be categorized as a West Coast IPA. Regardless, when it's available, get it. Racer 5 is consistently enjoyable; from visual, to aroma, to first taste, to feel and to the dry and slightly bitter aftertaste. Addendum: I never read other reviews before I write mine. I was amazed there were so many low scores. Then I noticed, many were from years ago. The most recent eight all rate this beer above 4. Could something have changed, i.e. recipe or shipping methods. Update, June 2021: Ratings continue to improve as the rare opportunity to sample this from a tap in Philadelphia has occurred.

Flavor – 4 – Good balance of piney malt (Or malty pine) with both noticeable and neither dominating. No alcohol (7.5 % ABV) flavor or aroma, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl.  Palate – 3.75 – Medium, almost creamy, lively carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4.25. I’m sure that the room temperature shelf storage and being past date contribute to the decreased coniferousness and increased maltiness, but it’s still tasty!","  rDev Bottle. Golden amber. Slight haze. Thin wispy head. Hoppy aroma. A balancing biscuit malt shows itself. Some pencil eraser. The flavour is nicely balanced again. Dry finish. Soft carbonation.  A first generation AIPA taste and feel. Not many made like this any more.","  Best by 9/26/19  Pours light burnt orange, slightest cloudiness, and topped with a pillowy, taut off-white head; very nice retention results in thick globs of sudsing trailing down the glass, as well as a dense, foamy cap and sizeable collar.  Aromas of caramelized oranges, sunflowers, apricot, pine, and grapefruit zest fly out front, while citrus and caramel malt builds on the back end and an earthy pungency is interspersed in between; there’s a delicate nuance of florality, piney hops, and citrus that has this quietly standing out.  Taste highlights a mix of candied pineapple, grapefruit pith, bitter, earthy pine, burnt citrus peel, herbal resin, and rice cracker shrouded in an overarching hoppy florality.  Mouthfeel provides a medium body, crisp and mostly dry, and steadily develops a condensed but punchy bitterness; underlying creamy kind of smoothness from a balanced carbonation; slightly oily toward finish leaving a thin layer of earthy resin to coat the palate.  This hits all the right notes and then some for a classic west coast-style IPA; concentrated bitterness, savory pine and grapefruit leanings, and an ultra florality that has it standing on its own. Prime execution and immensely enjoyable on all accounts.","  rDev S- Fruity hop notes. L- Quite dark gold. 1mm fine white head. T- Oh-hhh it's a hop-bomb. Pretty eye-watering. A bad sign on the 1st sip when I wonder whether I can finish it. M- Intensely hoppy dry, with perfumed notes wafting in afterwards. O- It's out of balance to me. More like a challenge than an assured and balanced brew. Bought from M+S at Paddington Station W2.

No visible BB. £2.75/330ml  Observation: The hoppier a beer, the shorter the reviews people write on it - ?","  rDev Pours a frosty, lightly foggy orange with a finger of off-white, foamy head. Head retention is fair. Aroma is pine, citrus, dank, and resin forming a classic IPA aroma. Citrus bodes well with the more evergreen-like hops. Biscuit, bread, and pale malts behind further mellow it out. Flavor profile is a lovely blend of biscuit, bread, and pale malts with resin, dank, and citrus hops. The duo works together well to form a hoppy, but balanced IPA. Hop notes are firmly on the traditional/classical side. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fizzy texture that imparts a little grainy abrasiveness around the edges. This mash up of textures with the slightly thicker feel creates a rather bold mouth feel overall. Overall, this is a great classic IPA. Hop notes are plentiful, but are well balanced out by malts. Neither one side dominates the experience.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev I have consumed a variety of beers over the last 10 plus years. I have passed this beer on my way to get other beers to think I have drunk that. Sadly, I learned the other day I have not drunk this classic. I nabbed this beer today as I doing shopping for a BIF. The beer is 43 degrees and served in a pint glass. A firm pour on the beer produced a two finger head with excellent retention. The head is bright white foamy and rocky. The color of the beer is a straw color with golden hues. The clarity of the beer is clear. The beer is active with effervesce.   The aromas in the beer are grapefruit, pine, citrus, toasted malt, and yeast.   The flavors in the beer are pine, citrus, grapefruit, toasted malt, and yeast.   The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.   The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and a medium finish.

This west coast IPA has a bit of a softer side. Piney, light citrus hops, light amber body with soft head, some lacing. Taste is more citrus than pine, easy on the palate, smooth, sweet and delicious. Not as  in your face  as so mmany other left coast IPAs.","  rDev Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a glass goblet. Clear, deep golden color, with a thick white head that left loads of sticky lacing as it settled to a thin ring. Light caramel up front on the aroma, with pine resin and citrus notes. Similar flavor profile, with slight malt sweetness providing structure for the piney and resiny hops. Good carbonation, medium mouthfeel, lots of bitterness lingering on the tongue. My sample may have been slightly past its prime, but still solid and highly drinkable.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb 4/3/18 (almost impossible to read cold-etched in glass near the bottom of bottle) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV. The beer pours just slightly hazy and golden in color. The head is off white and leaves abundant lacing on its way to a firm 1/4  cap. Aroma is fairly big with grapefruit and caramel mixed equally. The taste is semisweet caramel up front with citrus and pine playing in. The finish is crisp and drying with a nice bitter exclamation point. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and a little chalky(in a pleasant way). Overall, excellent. Really glad I had the opportunity to pick this up fresh and on the shelf. Perfect balance of hops and caramel malt. Recommended.","  rDev Had it in a pint glass poured from tap. Clear yellow with a nice head and good lacing. Pleasant citrus smell and taste. Definitely some pine notes included. It went well with the duck sliders for dinner.","  rDev Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a generous white head that lasts and clings.  Grapefruit dominates the aroma, but not offensively so - it is simply string and present until the end. Biscuit-like malt aromas are secondary but have a definite presence.  This is a full-flavored beer. There's enough malt to counterbalance the abundant grapefruit and there's a very refreshing minty/herbal component to the taste that brightens things up. There is just enough sweetness to keep the bitter tamed down, and a very slight biscuit contribution from the malt. Very round, complete taste.  The mouthfeel is smooth, moderate body, not thin at all. Carbonation appropriate to the sty.e  Overall this is an enjoyable beer to drink. The flavor is full and fresh, nothing sticks out at the expense of any component in particular. This is simply a very good beer.","  rDev L: Hazy orange with a big foamy white head.

Acquired recently from Trembling Madness in York. A classic IPA that I've wanted to try for a long time....  A: Poured into an IPA glass. Bottle conditioned. A rich golden-amber hue with hazy floating sediment and good carbonation. Produces a large head of fluffy white foam that lasts for a while before reducing to a persistent surface layer. Nice lacing.  S: Aroma of intense resinous hops with notes of pine, dank weed, floral hints, citrus peel, vague tropical fruit, sweet malt, mild earthy yeast and more than a whiff of booze. Nice.  T: Tastes of bitter pine-laden hops with hints of resin, dank weed, grapefruit, citrus peel, floral notes, sweet malt, earthy yeast and a touch of booze in the background. A strident hoppy bitterness upon swallowing.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and nice body. Hop oils stimulate the palate. Aftertaste of bitter hop notes, sweet malt and yeast.  O: Excellent - a top notch American IPA with a well deserved reputation. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are a satisfying blend of intense aromatic hops, sweet malt and yeast. The only minor flaw is the slightly excessive alcoholic note. Good body. Goes down all too easily - deserves to be sampled if you have the chance."]},{"Name":"Porter","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/7348/","Brewery":"Founders Brewing Company","Style":"Porter - Robust","Alcohol":6.50,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev This is a beer I have enjoyed for many years and was surprised to realize I had yet to review it. While irrelevant to the review, I love the label art.   A big, two-inch head glistens with dark, chestnut hues. A pancake batter forms over the opaque blackness within a Harp nonic. The batter ever so slowly retreats, leaving dense patches of lace in its wake. The head never fully dissipates, rather, it forms a quarter inch of dense cream to be penetrated with each sip.  Dark roasted Bakers chocolate yields to rich, roasted coffee beans. Later, malted chocolate mixes with caramel and light hints of floral and mint notes from the hops.  The flavor follows the nose, while the roasted nuances are subdued. Bitterness edges out sweetness and both are well controlled. The hops are more like pine straw than the floral or mint observed in the aroma. This could be a savory dessert with its light umami dancing in the long, mild finish.  The light to medium body is low for the style. A smooth, fluffy texture envisions dense fur. Soft carbonation lifts the light dryness, while residual sugar builds on the lips.  This goes well with a cigar, however, it is so good on its own, that one should reserve most of it for the pure drinking experience. It elevates a ribeye. Today, I enjoyed it while reading as my wife played the harp, on a cold, wet, November, Sunday afternoon.","  rDev Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC. Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. Looks dark brown almost black with a nice tannish foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap. Smells malty, sweet, chocolate and coffee. Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of chocolate coffee and caramel. Mouth feel is medium for the style with a nice creamy finish. Overall a very nice example of a Porter that I would definitely order again. Cheers!","  rDev 12 oz bottle from a six-pack purchased at the LCBO; dated Jul 15 2021 and served barely chilled.  Pours an inky, opaque brownish-black colour with crimson red highlights, topped with one finger of soapy, foamy, dark beige-coloured head. It dissipates within three minutes or so, reduced to a frothy collar of suds underneath an arcing swath of sticky lace. The aroma is potent - or perhaps 'robust' is a more appropriate descriptor here - with a nice mix of rich malt and understated hop contributions. I'm getting plenty of roasted malts, with dark chocolate, espresso and herbal, earthy hops; hints of char, licorice, maybe a touch of alcohol and devil's food cake.  A stellar robust porter that delights the taste buds from start to finish. Roasted malts at the forefront, imparting big dark roast coffee and espresso flavours; these are followed up by sweeter notes of fudge and dark chocolate. Earthy, herbal, woodsy hops at the finish, with a touch of licorice and coffee/roastiness in the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with low carbonation that gently brushes against the surface of the palate; feels smooth, soft, and satisfying to sip. This 12 oz serving was gone before I knew it, and thank goodness there's five more.  Final Grade: 4.26, an A-. Founders Porter is a must-try in the sense that it's an archetypical example of its style - it provides a template, a frame of reference for what to expect when sampling or reviewing robust porters in the future - I believe the term  gold standard  may be appropriate here. There's no additional ingredients or flavourings here - nothing but plain ol' porter, but damn is it a good one. Something I'd probably buy regularly if it were sold in Ontario year-round, but for now I'll have to keep my fingers crossed and hope for another shipment in the new year.","  rDev Single bottle from Party Town","  A squat brown twelve ounce bottle has had its contents poured into a clear pint glass. A lovely pour it is. The color inside the glass is that typical black coffee brown of most stouts/porters. The appropriate head is tan and leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Interestingly, there's no pronounced aroma other than a little maltiness. How this much taste is hidden from the nose is amazing. There's plenty of robust roasted malt here, that it's noteworthy. In fact, this is a roasted malt bomb. It's more complex, as there is some hopping character, although not bittering. The mouthfeel is smooth, but a little too light for the style. This is an above average American porter, but definitely not among the best.","  rDev Bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.5%, 45 IBUs. Pitch black colour, big and lasting brown head. Moderate roasty aroma, notes of dark chocolate and coffee. The flavour is roasty and quite dry, with a hint of acidity. Notes of coffee and ashes. Roasty and hoppy bitterness in the afteraste.","  rDev Bottled 3/4/20  As far as robust porters go, this one is my first. Also coincidentally the top rated in the style, which has actually happened to me a few times, twice even with Founders! I won't lie, I bought this a while back and have neglected it until now, but tonight is time for this one to (hopefully) shine  Pours nearly pitch black with 3 fingers of dense espresso colored head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves plenty of lacing  The aroma is standard fare for a porter, a subtle roast, rich chocolate, coffee, and light earthy hops. Nothing mind blowing here but it is certainly done well. There's a bit more of a malt presence in the nose than usual which I enjoy  This beer is all about balance it seems. Starting the sip off, I get light roast paired with delicately grassy hops. This really comes alive after the swallow, with notes of cocoa powder, vanilla, and caramel malts pairing with a steady but gentle dose of hops. Really an incredible flavor here  With a mostly full body and very subtle carbonation, this drinks somewhere between smooth and decadent. Not overly sweet in feel, but it definitely coats the tongue  Let me just say that I am way more impressed than I expected to be with this one. Founders obviously makes solid (and usually fantastic) beer, but I've had this one just sitting in my fridge for quite some time, and I never was really drawn to it until tonight, but I'm glad this is what I reached for.

Overall unusually dark, even for porter/stout. [ps. Head holds really well, unusually very well]. S- Toasty and deeply fragrant malts with a molasses edge. It actually reminds me of crunching away at the core of Malteser sweets as a child. T- Woah! Coffee, embers from a log fire, some smoke - quite a lot of it. This is notably pungent, actually for 6.5% this is unusually seriously pungently flavoured. M- The intense flavour is balanced and supported by appropriate richness. The feel lends this to being a slow-sipping winter-warmer type beer. You could enjoy it instead of an after-dinner coffee, or while sitting back in front of a winter fire-place. O- One of the more intensely flavoured beers I've ever had. Notable they built that upon a *relatively* light (for the style) 6.5% ABV and yet the balance of all the elements feels right. I'd suggest you need to really like coffee, and preferably espresso, for this to have a hope with you. You could suggest it's like a fusion of espresso and heavy black beer, it's that intense. Very well brought together, but might be just a touch OTT on the shear intensity of flavour for me.  Bought from Beerhawk/UK, 'Bottled on 03/08/19'. There is some form of code laser-etched into the base of the 355ml bottle but I can't find a BB date anywhere on the bottle/lable/cap etc.","  rDev Deep black, impenetrable even with a backlight. 1 inch+ thick, creamy, bubbly khaki head, which develops a rocky, pitted surface as it slowly recedes, leaving strings of lacing circling the glass.  Mild aroma: dark fruit with coffee, roasted malts, hints of chocolate.  Feel is silky, but a bit thin.  Taste is roasted malts and coffee front and center, some fruit flavor - plums, perhaps - underneath.

Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors, lots of roasted grains and malts, almost put you in the mind set of morning coffee. Mild sweetness of chocolate is a nice note to this brew. The body of Founders Porter is a solid medium, it is really hard to pick up on the 6.50% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. This brew would go nice with dinner or a cool night. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Roasted, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Founders Porter a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to.

The body was a bit on the thin side, for what I look for in the style.  Drinkability was good, the beer went down easily and quickly. Overall, a solid version of the style. Not up to the levels of say Black Butte or Edmund Fitzgerald, but not too far behind them either. Worth trying if you see it.","  rDev Was in the mood for some big malt and had just sampled Founders' Oatmeal Stout at a local, so this one called to me.  Bottled on December 18, 2017.

S -- Highly roasted malts/barley up front, light earthiness from hops or barley -- unsure, but very palatable.  T -- Same roasted malt character up front; coffee, dark chocolate, some light caramel and dark fruit notes, herbal hop bitterness in the finish and thru the aftertaste.  F -- Mouthfeel is creamy to dry with some mild astringency from the roasted malts. Body is robust.  O -- A roasted malt banquet, yet not so overpowering that it kills your palate. I tend toward more smooth and sweet Porters, but appreciate a good thick, roasty one now and again. If you like a roasted malt character balanced well with herbal hops, you'll enjoy this one. Be sure not to drink the Founders too cold, I made the mistake on one of the first and the flavor is really stunted -- let it warm to 50° F, or so for optimal enjoyment.","  Poured from a single serve bottle into a stout glass...  Pours a nearly (but not quite) opaque brownish black (really dark brown?) Excellent lacing, though the head retention was fairly lacking. The aromas are classic porter--char, chocolate, and espresso-dark coffee. The flavors are right there as well. An interesting mix of astringency and sweetness, with just a touch of hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is worthy of special note. Excellent body, without getting heavy. Full-bodied, yet light and dry at the finish, thanks to the aforementioned hops and some excellent carbonation. This is an excellent porter that truly distinguishes itself from its brother/sister/cousin, the stout.

Quite fresh smell, citrus (grapefruit), a hint of camomile. Without peaks. Less citrus in the taste, more resinuous. But very simple, without any peak. Done to be easily drinkable, so it is.","  rDev Served from the bottle into a 16 oz (473 ml) conical pint at Carson's American Bistro in Ann Arbor, Michigan; bottled 04/10/19. A: Pours a nearly clear, golden-orange-light copper with emphasis on the former, a less than one finger, spotty, white head, low retention, but decent rings sticky lacing. S: Aromas of nectarine (first), orange/tangerine, and caramel. T: Semisweet (lightly so). Flavors follow the nose fairly closely. Bitterness solid and consistent with the contemporary take of the style. M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, but persistence of fairly large bubbles.  O: A very enjoyable and easily quaffable take on the AIPA. I wouldn't say no to another.","  rDev Poured from a 19.2oz can  Appearance - Pours a copper amber with three fingers of frothy white head.  Smell - piney, leafy, weedy, earthy, and floral hops, bready malts, caramel, pine resin, grapefruit peel, and earthy yeast.   Taste - pine, leafy, earthy, and floral hops upfront. The pine resin and grapefruit peel come through next. The bready malts, caramel, and earthy yeast finish off the brew.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes slightly off-dry with the hops, pine resin, and malts lingering.  Overall - A classic West Coast session IPA that delivers on both the flavour and sessionability fronts. A bold and flavourful brew that I could easily enjoy at anytime of the year.","  rDev Clear, bright gold body; thick, soapy and frothy white head. Spicy and pine-like aroma; resinous. Nice hop flavor and bitterness over a mild biscuit malt base. Medium-light body; tingly on the palate; fairly dry overall.  I couldn't make out the date on the can bottom, but I found this to be a fairly tasty beer for a session IPA. The ABV isn't too low and the malt and hop bill play nicely together. I certainly would imbibe in more if given the opportunity.","  rDev 12 oz. Can CANNED ON: 03 18 19  Poured into a Tired Hands glass a pretty nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, with some pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger plus off-white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, grapefruit), piney. The taste is hoppy, malty, with a nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, grapefruit), piney. Medium body, ABV is hidden very nicely, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, a tasty brew.","  rDev Pours a foggy dark orange with a little visible particle suspension. Head is a finger and a half in height, and retains well. Aroma orange, biscuity, earthy malts and herbal, resiny, light citrus hops. Balance is good between malts and hops. Flavor profile is biscuity, bready, earthy malts and herbal, floral, resiny and sticky hops. Balance is good, creating a very neutral, easy-drinking beer. Mouth feel is soft with a very light crispness that breaks down to a lightly watery-base at the finish. It has a medium-thin consistency. Overall, very well balance with subtle malts and hops combine well with a soft and thin texture to create a very refreshing, easy-drinking, flavorful beer.  Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev From notes 3/25/13: Pours a clear deep honey gold with a faint greenish hue when held to the light. The pour produces 1.5 fingers of frothy, somewhat lasting, white head that leaves splotches, strings and motes of lace. Aroma is pine resin heavy with some grapefruit flesh and pith backed by low caramel malt sweetness. Taste is pine needle tart and bitter resin, grapefruit zest, flesh and pith so heavy that it masks most of the malt. It finishes peppery and bitter transitioning to a simple bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, watery but lively in the mouth and astringent aftertaste.","  rDev Canning date was all smudged out, so not sure how fresh this was, but, ...much better than expected! Clear, medium-golden/faintly amber body, few fingers of white foam on top... Light, crisp, clean, smooth... Crackery malt backbone with some hoppy pine shellac and a bit of dry citrus rind... Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, amply carbonated and really refreshing... I think I killed the 12 oz can in like 5 hearty swigs! Don't know if this is gonna change my world view on session beers, but it might - totally possible to crush a six-pack of this without even trying...","  rDev Pours bright, clear gold with a smallish head. Floral, citrus, pine hop notes fill the aroma. Grapefruit, pine, apricot, floral notes in the taste. Light, clean bready malt in the back. Medium to light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Medium bitterness lingers a while in the long finish.  A fantastic Session IPA with an OG hop profile. More of the grapefruit, pine, floral notes of IPAs of old. Excellent stuff.","  rDev Not a terribly exciting beer. I'm a big fan of IPA's, but not most session beers. This is better than most, but fairly one dimensional. Hops without much of a malt backbone to balance things out. Just hop bitterness with a fairly thin mouthfeel. It does have its place though if you don't feel like getting hammered after several beers, but I'd take Firestone Easy Jack over this one.","  rDev In the session IPA category, this is about as good as it gets. Of course, I'd just call this a pale ale if I tasted it blind. It's light, but not watery like most session IPAs. Great price too. Pretty much a summer go-to beer.","  rDev Straw yellow, a bit hazy colored. Big head that faded quickly. Great hop aroma. It's fairly light tasting with a touch of piney on the tongue. Super easy drinking and obviously, by the name, an all day IPA and @4.7% ABV it will probably make a good one. Canned on 05/17/17 so it lasts well. I t still seems fresh. From a 19.2 ounce can into a nonic glass.","  rDev L: Clear honey gold with a rocky white head. Moderate retention. A film remains. Sheets of lacing.  S: Grapefruit and pine. The classic IPA aroma. It smells really good right now, though. Grapefruit juice as well as peel and zest and oils. Pine needle, orange peel, and light bready, toasty malt.  T: Big pink grapefruit juice, flesh, pith, and peel, all in perfect harmony. Big essence of grapefruit--sweet, sour, and bitter all at once. Lightly toasty, bready malt in the middle with hints of caramel and honey. A touch of orange and mango as well. Nice sticky pine on the back end, slightly resinous and vibrant. Finishes crisp, with a slight lingering stickiness of resin and a light piney bitterness.  F: Light, but not watery. Very well carbonated. Finishes fairly crisp and clean save a sticky hop resin that coats the palate.  O: I can't believe I haven't reviewed this earlier. This beer is the progenitor of the session IPA substyle, and still one of the best. A really great beer on its merits.","  rDev Sample from bottle at Vectura-messe. Also available on tap and bottle at Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. Golden colour, white head. Fresh American grapefruity and piney hops throughout, in both aroma and flavour,","  rDev I can see why this is one of the go-to standards from Founders. A great, sessionable IPA. Nice golden color with moderate white foamy head, some mild lingering lacing. Smells of nice hops, more floral than citrus. Tastes of floral hoppiness, some nice bright fruit, malt and biscuit. Very little bitterness. Thin mouthfeel, perfect amount of moderate carbonation throughout. A great, rock-solid beer.","  rDev Stupid-ass 19.whateverthefuck oz can poured into shaker pint. Poured a lightly cloudy yellow-gold color with about 5/8 inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.  The aroma had nice hops, and mild grain.  Taste was the same, citrus.pine hops over soft malt.  The body was light, had good carbonation, and a semi-dry finish.  Drinkability was fine, no issues, except for the idiotic can size. Overall, solid enough. It's no Field 41, but it's enjoyable enough. worth trying if you see it.","  rDev 355ml can. L: Opaque, burnt orange colour. Two fingers of off-white, dense, lumpy head collapses slowly to leave a thick cap and lots of lacing. S: Light, short-lived, citrus aromas. T: Soft, sweet orange plus spice and wood. Bitter hops. F: Light body, light carbonation, kick of bitterness in the finish, decent mouth coating. But ultimately still a little thin. O: A decent low ABV AIPA but the mouthfeel suffers as usual. Proof again that it’s almost always better to drink a genuine low ABV style, like an English pale ale, than a low ABV version of a high ABV style.","  rDev 19.2 oz can, dated 10/24/17.  Clear amber with a big, creamy white head that leaves behind patchy lacing on the glass.  Aroma is a classic mix of pine, grapefruit, and orange citrus. Faint sweet pale malt too, if you really search for it. Flavor is citrus and tropical fruit, with bitterness from the hops. Not much else going on other than that.  Body is medium-light and it's refreshing and easy to drink. It teeters on the edge of becoming too thin, but there's just enough body there to keep you interested.   Admittedly, the session IPA is not my favorite style. But this is likely the best one I've had. Most just taste like hop water and lack character but this is more akin to a pale ale than session IPA.","  rDev Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a glass goblet. Clear copper-colored body, with two fingers of off-white head that left a modicum of sticky lacing as it settled. Even at two months past the bottling date, there was lots of hop character. Big aromas and flavors of pine, orange, and citrus zest, balanced by a light caramel malt presence. Light to medium mouthfeel, crisp finish, and a bit of resin and citrus zest lingering on the palate. Light and refreshing. this one delivers.","  rDev Can. Hazy light amber. 1cm frothy head.  Tangerine, pine and grapefruit aroma. Distant apricot. Malt is subdued. Mild version of the smell on tasting. Decent bitter completion. Light to moderate body. Medium carbonation. Good to taste a low ABV AIPA for a change."]},{"Name":"Pumking","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/38394/","Brewery":"Southern Tier Brewing Company","Style":"Pumpkin Beer","Alcohol":8.60,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev 2019 vintage  Someone tell me why I keep coming across pumpkin beers at the end of April?? Like this is the 2nd one in a few days. Once again, from the clearance section of the liquor store, but for only $1 I couldn't pass it up, and I've heard this one is good  Pours a hazy burnt orange with a finger of soapy white head that doesn't stick around for very long, fades to a film and leaves no lacing  Wow, that aroma is killer. Big spice notes, but completely balanced by notes of squash and brown sugar. Sweet caramel malts bring it all together with a complex nuttiness. It smells so warm and inviting, just perfect in that aspect  The taste is very similar to the aroma with a bit less sweetness, and the hops surprisingly come through a bit to add and interesting balance. Very authentic pumpkin flavor balanced with mild nutmeg and piney hops, tastes like fall  Holy shit does this hide its abv well. It's super light bodied without sacrificing flavor, moderate carbonation leads to a wonderfully crisp finish  I really wasn't expecting to be wowed by an out of season, not very fresh pumpkin beer, but here we are. As a sucker for pumpkin this was phenomenal. I don't think I could have more than 2 in a sitting, but I do wish there was more than a single bottle on that discount rack","  rDev I can't believe I've never reviewed this! Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It pours a hazy, orange-amber with a small, milk-white head that faded quickly. It smells just like pumpkin pie: lots of pumpkin, nutmeg, and clove, and a buttery, bready, caramel malt base that reminds me of pie crust. The taste follows the nose; the first thing I notice is the buttery pie crust with fairly sweet, fresh pumpkin puree and lots of spice. I'm tasting nutmeg, allspice, and clove. There is just a hint of hoppiness at the finish. I have to say it's one of the more unique flavors in a Pumpkin Ale. It's fairly effervescent and the 8.6% ABV gives it good substance. Overall, I've always enjoyed this offering and am glad to finally review it. The pie crust quality gives it an extra dimension lacking in its peers.","  rDev So, this is my brother's favorite beer in the world. I have had it many times and somehow never reviewed it.   Crystal clarity, bright orange golden color and superstrong, supersweet, spot on nose. Like pumpkin pie and a big beer.   The texture is rich and coating but not too thick or oily. Flavor is a solid impressuion of the nose. The big abv is imperceptable. This is consistently the best pumpkin each year available on the east coast, at least.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a taster; vintage 2019. A: Pours a crystal clear, dark golden leaning toward amber color with a two finger, white colored head, rim retention, and limited lacing. S: Aromas of grasses and grains initially with a touch of pumpkin and spice, evolving to strong pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, as it warms. T: Entirely dry. Flavors of pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg are very present. Mostly pumpkin. Bitterness is light, but imparts surprising sharp finish for this style. M: Medium bodied with moderate, persistent carbonation. O: The taste of Fall in New York State. Really enjoyable.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle vintage 2019 into the test glass. A - Dark straw color, solid carbonation, yields a relaxed white cap. S - A touch of spices, vegatal element T - Balanced with the base malt and fruit/spice additions creating the pumpkin pie illusion quite well M - Medium in body , crisp in carbonation, semi sweet  O - A very well constructed offering, not to weighted toward spices","  rDev Pours a fairly clear amber with fine, tan head.  Smell is sweet and spicy, with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and some wheat dough.  Taste follows the nose but ups the sweetness and adds a bit of booze.  Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated.  Overall, a decent beer, bit way too sweet.","  rDev Appearance - Pours super clear copper color with a dense white head that settles to a thin cap. Spotty lacing.  Aroma - Very light pumpkin spice and nutmeg, clove, mild alcohol aroma and cinnamon.  Taste - Taste is much better and stronger than the aroma. Sweet potato, nutmeg, pumpkin spice, vanilla. Alcohol is still coming through a little. cinnamon and brown sugar.  Feel - thin mouth feel, little warmth from the alcohol, would be much better if it was a little thicker.  Overall - Not a bad pumpkin beer, nose is thin and weak taste is pretty solid.","  rDev Exceptional pumpkin beer, really a great combination of flavorful yet not too heavy. Lighter amber color with some mild lingering head and spotty lacing. Smells great, strong pumpkin, spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, malt. Tastes similarly, along with vanilla and some very mild biscuit. Higher ABV is very well hidden. Smooth slightly creamy mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation. Excellent beer to get into the season!","  rDev Thanks to bbothen for sending this particular bottle. Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Cigar City Humidor Series tulip glass.  A: Pours a hazy golden brown with a thin white head that fades quickly. Lots of large-bubble visible carbonation.  S: Pumpkin and bready malts. There’s nutmeg, sweet brown sugar, cinnamon and spices. Pretty standard pumpkin beer approach here, but decent.  T: Tastes like pumpkin pie, with biscuit malts that seem lighter and less bready in taste than most pumpkin beers. Caramelized brown sugar, nutmeg, lighter cinnamon and cloves. The hang is modestly sweet pumpkin and some lingering spices.  M: The body is on the light side for a lot of pumpkin beers. Low alcohol presence, and quite a bit of carbonation sensation.  O: This just is not my favorite style. But honestly this is a little better than I remember from the last time I drank it.","  rDev Pours a clear &amp; bright orange soda amber with no effervescence rising. The pour produces 2+ fingers of short-lived off-white head which diminishes to a minor surface cap &amp; collar leaving motes &amp; strings of lace as it recedes. Aroma is caramel malt, pie crust, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon &amp; other spices. Taste is pumpkin, caramel, Graham cracker, roasted pecans &amp; pie dough with nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, cloves &amp; alcohol spice. Alcohol is prominent. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with medium carbonation, smooth, wet &amp; tongue coating but with a nice lively spice. My favorite pumpkin ale. Very close to liquid pumpkin pie with an alcohol kick!","  rDev Amber appearance with slight white head. Very very mild aroma. Taste is a significant nutmeg with a minimal pumpkin taste. Very artificially tasting pumpkin beer","  rDev on tap at The Brickhouse in Orwigsburg, PA tonight.  Served in a 14oz goblet. Hazy orange color, with big white head which persists in some form all the way down, leaving decent lacing.   aroma is of pumpkin spice, and apples.   Really good taste to this one. Not a cinnamon assault, as some pumpkin beers are, the spices are very nicely balanced with a solid actual pumpkin taste to it. enjoying this one.   mouth is getting pretty close to full, finish is fairly sweet and slightly spicy.   overall, I've been trying to give pumpkin beers another shot this year, and in this particular case, I'm glad I did. Southern Tier rarely disappoints this palate, and certainly didn't here.","  rDev Pours a golden orange color with a foamy off-white head that disappears quickly. Sweet aroma of pumpkin spice. Tastes of pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, ginger, and allspice). Spices were a bit over the top but a decent pumpkin beer.","  rDev Pours a bright orange with a two finger white head that was well retained and left decent lacing. Smells and tastes like pumpkin pie-pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla, caramel and some booze. Taste gets better as the beer warms. Medium bodied and carbonated, smooth mouth feel.","  rDev Poured from a 22 oz bomber. 2016 vintage.  Appearance: Golden orange body with a 1/2 fingers worth of bubbles on top. Decent lacing left in the glass.  Aroma: Yep, it's a pumpkin pie in a glass! Cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla. Inviting aroma!   Taste/Mouthfeel: Just like drinking a pumpkin pie! This one tastes even better as you let it warm up. The mouthfeel is light, however there is a little strange after taste which lingers a little after each sip, but is gone shortly thereafter. I rated it lower due to this.  Overall: A beautiful looking and smelling beer and other than the strange bitter aftertaste this is still a fabulous beer. I think sitting it in the fridge for a year helped this one quite a bit, too.","  rDev Clear orange color,less than average carbonation. Aroma is boozy custard pumpkin pie,boosted by a lot of spice. Taste was the same but too much nutmeg or clove,it made it a bit off putting after a few sips. As it warms it starts to taste like a pumpkin pie spice candle,a little artifical. Some will probably like this and I understand why but some probably won't either and I get the reasons why also","  I am not really into pumpkin beers, especially if the pumpkin spice is too strong or taste too artificial. However, this pumpkin beer was very good in my opinion. It might be the best pumpkin beer I’ve ever had.  Look: cloudy amber hue with an inch white bubble head.  Aroma: malts, pie crust and pumpkin pie spices, really nice aroma.  Taste: Malty sweetness and Pumpkin, but not too much, some vanilla and other flavors like Pumpkin Pie in a glass.   Feel: smooth, soft, medium body","  rDev Pours a clear pale copper in color with a half finger of short lived white head, then the beer looks flat. Pleasant aroma and flavor, some pumpkin but lots of spices: cloves, cinnamon, allspice, some nutmeg. The beer is definitely sweet but the spices keep it from being cloying. Medium bodied and a bit syrupy in feel with a hint of slickness, carbonation is less than low and the beer is nearly flat. Aside from the carbonation issue this is a solid beer. I usually don't like pumpkin ales but this one strikes a good balance on the pumkin and spice notes that keeps it pretty drinkable.","  rDev Pours an amber orange color; very autumnal in appearance. The head quickly recedes and leaves no cap, collar or lacing. Nice pumpkin pie, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aroma.  There is pumpkin in the taste, however, the spices also play a big role. There is also a significant hops profile that adds bittering. There is an alcohol warming in the finish. Medium bodied to full and chewy. A nice pumpkin ale that is complex. I will have it again.","  rDev Starts off with a 2 finger head that fizzles out to nothing in the chalice, with a festive burnt orange color with light amber shades dancing and out along the sides. 30% opaque.   Smells like a fall candle or a wax warmer. Vanilla cookie, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, nilla wafer, and a touch of citronella.   Quite a bit of spice, some of it burnt, in the form of nutmeg, cinnamon, and a bit of bitter herbal notes; a touch of vanilla, citronella, and yogurt. As it settles on the back of the palate, it rests on lactose, lavender, and flower stem. As it warms the finish tastes like dirt and the alcohol really makes an ugly appearance.  Feel is medium bodied, relatively dry, yet keeps the carbonation firm and interesting.   Overall, Pumking is a pretty hyped beer and the only real hype I see justified is the nose. Incredible nose. The rest of it just falls flat for me. It's not a total failure, it's just an above average pumpkin ale. I ended up not finishing the bottom 1/5 of my glass. I got this bomber on sale for $5.49 so I'm not terribly upset, but unless it's on a mega sale I don't think I'd ever purchase it again.","  rDev I'll admit that I just don't get pumpkin beer, nothing seems more gimmicky to me. A friend told me this was the best so I decided to try a bomber. Even more amazing to me, 4 packs of this crap were $15.79, thank god I only tried a bomber. Acrid, with a strange bitterness and noticeable alcohol heat - the smell reminds me of a pumpkin scented candle. What's next, turkey and gravy flavored beer, maybe mincemeat beer? I have to do myself a big favor and accept the fact that pumpkin really doesn't belong in a beer. If you want pumpkin, do yourself a favor and have a slice of pie and have a good beer to compliment it.","  rDev This year I am actually trying to go through all the different pumpkin beer offerings across the landscape, at least as much as I humanly can. I can say, this offering from Southern Tier is pretty damn good.  The beer is not so impressive out of the bottle - an orange colored ale with no head or lacing, though it's got pretty good highlights. The smell was very impressive - a strong scent of pumpkin, sweet, mixed with just enough of the ale to make a good odor in the nose. The mouthfeel was considerably carbonated, but not overpowering, some astringent feel, but easily overlooked. Now, when it came to the taste, it was everything I smelled, the pumpkin, the ale, the 8.5% ABV (a very nice touch). Overall, though I haven't had many pumpkin beers, so far this one is the best and I wonder if I will actually come across something better.","  rDev 12oz. bottle - vintage 2016  Pours a slightly hazy highly carbonated golden amber orange with a frothy white foam head. Smells like real pumpkin pie with big graham crackery pie crust, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, spice, bready caramel malt, with floral earthy herbal grassy pine. Tastes like bitter floral earthy grassy pine, pumpkin pie spices, booze, vanilla, graham cracker crust, pumpkin, bready caramel malt, with some dried fruit medley. Feels medium bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a nice imperial pumpkin ale.","  rDev 2016 vintage.  Pours translucent dark gold with a half-inch khaki head head that fades completely and leaves faint lace. The smell is of biscuit bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, molasses and hazelnut. The taste follows with pumpkin, Autumn spices, molasses and an unexpected nuttiness. Medium texture with a faint indication of the 8.6% ABV.","  rDev 22 oz bottle. Pours hazy orange with a head the dissipates quickly. No lacing. Strong clove and nutmeg nose. Drinks smooth with a strong malt backbone and a hint of pumpkin.","  rDev Southern Tier Imperial Pumking, cellared 6 months. Not picking up much pumpkin taste, but some spice. Not too bitter, overall OK beer. Picked this up in Wisconsin since it's not distributed here.","  rDev Conceptually, pumpkin never seemed like a preferred ingredient for beer. But, it has grown enough to be its own style and Pumking is the most popular. As advertised as  pumpkin pie in a glass  it is close and the spices are, well, for pumpkin pie !  Pumking is on the  1001  list, probably because it helped create the style or as the reviewer points out, to revive the style from the 18th Century when malt could be short supply and pumpkins and traditional spices were used. So, we are dealing with a pre-industrial style of necessity that American crafters again have revived.   11/6/21 After 6 years, I had Pumking again and improved my rating considerably and edited my review. (After all, I am more mature.)  As for my huge Overall Hugs for Southern Tier, let me explain. I've only had three ST beers; they tend to brew imperials and I'm too old for high ABV; they tend to experiment with flavors and I'm a fuddy-duddy. So while I respect their creativity as they start their third decade, ST is not likely to become my go-to (aside from problems distributing in Illinois.) But ST is a pioneer and I want to recognize that. And I want to compliment them for having opened taprooms in 4 more cities that also need to elevate their beer culture. And finally, for their collaborative capitalist venture called Artisinal Brewing Ventures that, without any study, strikes me as a good way for second generation regional crafters get together and grow without having to sell out to the Big Boys. So for that and much more, I give Big Hugs."]},{"Name":"Bigfoot","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/2671/","Brewery":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","Style":"Barleywine - American","Alcohol":9.60,"Score":92.0,"Comments":["  rDev At the Cincinnati Beer Fest 2022","  rDev 2022 Pours a clear garnet with a generous khaki head, excellent retention and lacing Grapefruit, floral, and piney hops over a deep caramel malt aroma with hints of dried fruit Bold pine and grapefruit rind hops, big caramel malt.

The beer pours a slightly cloudy amber color with some deep garnet highlights on the edges. A dense fluffy head of 2.5 cm foams up and slowly fades to a cotton candy like surface foam. Great dense lattice clinging to the glass as it slips down toward the surface. Aroma is some chocolate and caramel mixing with a bit of toasted grain and brown sugar, but also still a good hop bite. The hops show up with some pine sap and and black tea scent, but the booze is pretty well hidden.  The first sip on this beer is amazing, very creamy and soft texture, which I didnt expect. Fine gentle carbonation that fizzes up in my mouth when swished. Medium body and this beer drinks pretty easy for the physical traits. Flavor is what I expect after the aroma, but a little more hop focused than the nose which was more balanced. I get some dark chocolate, bakers type here, a bit of caramel and some light brown sugar.

Let's dive in  Pours a clear ruby tinged dark amber with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  Good lord, the aroma definitely sells the freshness of this American barleywine, it's all about the hops! I'm picking up on aromas of oily dank hops, pithy grapefruit, pine, sweet caramel, dark bread, molasses, and a touch of black cherry  This is incredibly balanced in taste, constantly mingling the best expressions of hops and malt. On the front end of the sip, I'm tasting dark toffee, molasses, lightly piney hops, and toasty malt. The swallow is a different beast, at first bringing notes of dark fruits, thick molasses, orange zest, and brown sugar, before leaving lingering notes of spicy pine and alcohol  A medium full body pairs with soft carbonation resulting in an insanely smooth and easy drinking beer. Finishes almost entirely dry because of the hops, creating a rather refreshing barleywine, if there's such a thing  This is a classic for a reason. Highly drinkable and so delicious, I could have way more of this. I want to find more to cellar, but this is great fresh","  rDev Let sit out until barely chilled. 55F? Doing a side-by-side with a 2019 (bottled 12/05/18) &amp; a 2021 (12/04/20)  L :  2019 : Lightly hazy medium amber, with a slight touch of reddishness. 3/4 finger of light tan head, that leaves a thin ring, a thin center sheet, and a few spots of lacing. (3.75) 2021 : Same as above, except for slightly darker, and longer lasting head. (4)   S:  2019 : Toffee, dried figs ,prune, caramel, a little leather, and slight doughy malt. (4.25)  2021 : Resinous piney hops - smooth/rounded, not sharp - , light fruitiness somewhere between cherry pie filling (but less sweet) and brandy , &amp; light fresh bread aroma. Definite difference , that I could smell as I was pouring. (4)  T: 2019: An initial kiss of sweetish toffee, followed by dried figs, though less sweet and with a woody tang - similar to when getting a bit of stem within the bite of fig , finishing with light, dryiing bitterness . (4.25) 2021: Brown bread (think ginger bread , minus the ginger/spices), but lighter , slight caramel, a light, vague fruity/floral flavor (hops, I assume) finishing with light bitterness, and a bit of very light lingering pine. Given the greater hop presence in the aroma, this fresh one comes across as less hoppy/bitter, and not as dry of a finish. (4)  F: 2019 : Medium , moderately oily/slick, with light-medium , soft carbonation tingle. Lingering drying finish that leaves the tongue with a scrubbed-clean feeling. (4) 2021: Similar to the older version, but a bit more oily/slick feeling, and less of a dry/stripped feel on the tongue.(4.25)  Overall, a pleasure , at either age. If I could choose only one, it would be the older version. The fresh one feels better, but the aged one has more complexity. Guessing that the flavors need time to develop, and the hop presence in the fresh version masks some of what is there. My conclusion : get multiples, have one(at least) now, and set some aside for later.","  rDev Muddy, dark ruby-tinted brown with a half finger of tan foam with remarkably good retention, slowly giving way to thick lacing.  Fig, orange marmalade and stale earthy hops show in the nose, with flashes of vanilla and leather behind.   Way drier tasting than expected; nothing at all like the aroma. It has thin mushroomy taste, with extremely strong piney bitterness in the finish.  On the thin side of medium bodied with fairly strong carbonation.  It’s amazing how little malt plays into the the taste of this beverage. Not really to my preference. 2017 bottle.","  rDev 2020 release (PKGD 12/12/19 19:56)  Clear, dark amber body; incredibly fine and slow rising carbonation; dense, creamy and sticky light tan head. Heavy malt nose; excellent blend of caramel and roasted grains with a touch of nuts in the smell. The taste amplifies the smell qualities; richer, boozier flavors; low-key suggestion of brown sugar; fantastic dull bitterness to counterpoint the sweetness. Heavy body; thick and oily; buttery smooth; some alcohol bite and heat (very muted).  This beer definitely exudes decadent, boozy sweetness. And it all works. One is pressed to find any issues (definitely no significant) issues. It is awesome in its magnificence!","  rDev Re-review 2020. This is a 2017 vintage I'm having tonight, and I figured 3 years would have tapered off the harshness of the hops, and helped this beer mellow out a bit, even as a very hoppy American Barleywine.   Pours a dark oxidized caramel color with an egg foam yellow head of 1/2 finger.   Aroma of hop oils, perfume, alcohol, golden raisin, dark raisin, and caramel.   Flavor is candy vitamins, oxidized hops, raisin, resin, hop oils, and yellowed hop leaves.  Feel is hot and scathing, medium bodied and thinning out on the palate. Heat remains.   Overall, I have never liked this beer, got it as an  extra  in a trade, and figured I'd give it one more shot. It turns out this is still an awful hoppy mess - and I'm a huge hop head now. It's not balanced in any regard, and is on the lowest of the low for barleywine beers. So gross. I can drink the heaviest triple IPAs, but this thing is just a fucking gross mess. It is a total drain pour. Zero balance to this beer whatsoever. Like drinking straight hop oils. It's the biggest head shaker for me on highly regarded commercial craft beer.  -------------------------- 3/22/2017  Year : 2016.   It starts off great with a pour of mahogany and burnt caramel. The head is egg foam yellow and towering above the woody body.   On the label it talks about a lot of cone hops, but that's about all I smell when nosing this particular BW. This comes off more as a quadruple iPA in the aroma. Onion, grapefruit, garlic. Hits of caramel.   SN's Barleywine drinks like a hoppy, oily mess. I realize the American Barleywine style is hoppier than the English counterpart, but this is just a cop out. Dump a bunch of hops into the boil and use a touch of caramel malts along with the huge pale malt bill and there you have it. It's total vidalia onion, awful grapefruit, and a garbage-caramel gross sweetness. Awful.  I just can't quit disliking this beer. Feel is slick and oily, all the way down. Not boozy, not alcoholic, just a resiny mess.   Overall a very disconnected, one trick hop-blasted beer that drinks more like a super hop infused malt liquor. It's disgusting. I'll probably never return to this beer since it's turned me off so badly! To style? This beer is a fat ass F. It's an IPA if anything, and barleywine-ignorant-hopheads with scrubbed palates are the only reason this beer gets any credit.  1.69 / 5","  rDev Pours a mahogany color with some black cherry highlights. Smell is malts dark fruits ,citrus and caramel. Taste is hoppy with grapefruit and pine finishes with malt and caramel. Mouth feel is hoppy and malty,its boozy and has some sweetness.","  rDev Poured to a BrewDog snifter.  A: Body is coppery and shows a beige head that doesn't have much retention like pretty much all barleywines. S: The aroma is powerful on molasses and mildly roasted malts. It's not a new thing but it smells wonderfully. It almost seems like the sweetness present in some Tripels. T: This beer starts off with a huge component on sweetness, with caramel, molasses, sugary malty tones. This then moves up to a mildly bitter end that finishes with a very crisp and toasty profile. It's pretty much a very good beer. M: Body is medium high. Carbonation is low. Alcohol is barely noticeable even running at 9.6% ABV. Bitterness is low. O: Not the best barleywine I've had but for Sierra Nevada, even if they're not innovating very much with their porftolio, this one is a keeper.","  rDev This Is now one of my favorite SN offering...  Beautifully colored in dark caramel, it has nice foam and impressive lacing down the glass. The smell is a mixture of hops, malty sweetness, and floral notes. Mouthfeel is carbonated but not overpowering, it has a slightly creamy texture that is more noticeable as it warms. The taste was definitely hip-forward with hints of the malty sweetness I detected in the nose. Overall, this was very much enjoyable, a brew I will be on the lookout moving forward.","  rDev 2013 Vintage - Consumed on 4-16-2019.  Consumed at room temp.   Pours a nice amberish color. 1 finger, frothy, and slightly off white head. Nice lacing on the glass as the head dissipates. Considering the age, I'm surprised at the head retention.  The nose has a slight sweetness to it. It isn't too strong. Bready, yeasty smelling. Pleasing.  Taste - Rich and complex. There's a bread, malt, sweetness. There's actually a decent hop flavor here, which surprised me. Some raisin.  It's got a decent, boozy punch.. Thick full body. Surprised at the carbonation, considering the age, but it dances on my tongue.  This is a solid Barleywine, and it ages well. Glad to try a vintage.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Bottled date on label is '12/14/16 2031'. Medium amber colored body, which is cloudy. Half finger of off white head sticks around as thin cap. Leaves behind some strings and spots of lacing. This aroma is not very attractive, but expresses dark fruit prune and raisin. Good hops back up. Taste is dark roasted with prune and raisin, and bright hops. Mouth feel is close to full, with dark fruit resonance. Very smooth with the dark fruit influence. Good carbonation. Expresses as a fully thought out and developed American barleywine beer. Can be sipped or crushed both, according to  how this barleywine is experienced.","  rDev Pours a deep vibrant red/copper, nice head with great retention and lacing, color of clay. Smell is sweat figs and apples with some sweet hop/herb notes. Cherry and caramel hits as well. Taste is definitely hop forward, quite bitter, tastes like black tea and lightly of lemon or lime peel. some tart apple and more caramel as it warms up. Hadn't had this in years and am honestly shocked at how hoppy it is. This could pass as an imperial IPA. Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side. Really surprised at that, it's not watery but it is definitely not dominant or really filling. Overall this is a really nice english imperial IPA? The most American of American barleywines I suppose. It is assertively hoppy and surprisingly light bodied. Not really what I want when I want barleywine but a nice beer none the less.","  rDev Had it on tap in a snifter after watching the Damcing With The Stars road show.  Rich dark reddish brown color with a nice beige head and excellent lacing. Pleasant toffee smell and taste. The taste includes notes of caramel, brown toast and a bit of booze. A very enjoyable beer!","  rDev Bottled on 12/1/17 (2018 release)  Pours a clean, effervescent deep maroon topped with a thick, fluffy off-white head; very solid retention results in thick walls of lacing and a steady collar when it recedes.  Aroma is heavily piney, but smooths out without becoming too aggressive; fairly one-dimensional, but the intermingling with light tones of sweeter, roasty caramel malt in the background really further the depth of a singular note and has it bursting.  Taste really brings forth some of the restrained aggression in the pine and hops with an earthy bitterness that builds calmly through to the finish; like the aroma, softer notes of caramel malt are present to diversify the profile as its few notes develop.  Mouthfeel shows a fairly robust medium body with a steadily increasing hoppy bitterness and a spectacularly leveled medium carbonation. Drying toward the finish, but a slight stickiness prevents it from doing so fully; overall, silky, gritty, and equal parts easy and aggressive on the palate; so excellently done.  Aggressive, hoppy, and singular in its profile, this is just a beast of a beer with some incredible balance shown throughout; easy to see why this could be considered a quintessential American barleywine. Very enjoyable.","  rDev Pours a chill hazed coppery deep amber producing variable head size from 2 fingers to voluminous depending on the purchase and pour. The head is tan, frothy and lasting. It leaves a wash of sticky lacing 1/2-1 inch above the collar ring regardless of total head height. Aroma is spicy, cake-like bready, sweet grain, caramel/toffee, subtle raisin, fig and white fruits; some grass &amp; pine with a strong alcohol note. Taste is boozy sweet caramel/toffee, sweet bready malt, thin dark fruits with a chocolate hint. Hop presence is earthy herbal and pine. Hints of molasses, sweet potato casserole and white fruits appear as the brew warms. Starts sweet and remians so for most of the sip with a faint peppery prickle appearing briefly in the middle. Bitters between midsip and finish and hangs on into the aftertaste. Aftertaste is caramel malty, bitter pine, alcohol blend. Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with medium carbonation, smooth, silky with an hint of alcohol bite.","  rDev 2012 bottle, so nicely aged.  A - Dark brown body, mostly opaque with strong red and orange highlights, light tan head with an orange tint, and extensive small bubble lacing.  S - Harsh alcohol and pine notes, almost like floor cleaner, but in a manner that is not offensive per se. Caramel and lemon aspects are also there, offering something more pleasant.  T - A sipper, as you might expect. Opens with caramel sweetness, leading to lemon and bread, and a grassy, steeped tea bitter bite in the finish. That bite helps keep things from getting cloying but is itself a bit overpowering, particularly when the beer is still cold. You end up wanting to take another sip quick, but if you let it linger, the biting bitterness does trail off after peaking at about 30 seconds from the drink.  M - Moderate body, with a very dry and building finish.  O - This is a beer designed to sit and grow. And it does offer great flavor range, a mingling of bitterness and sweet caramel. Not a favorite style, but well built and offering quite a bit to chew on.","  rDev 2018 version. Pours a clear light to medium brown with ruby red highlights. a one inch creamy tan head that left nice blotches of lacing. Smells of lightly roasted malts, toffee, raisins and hops. Taste is far more bitter than I expected, somewhat sweet roasted malts, toffee, raisins, dates and alcohol. This beer is meant for sipping and needs to be drank at near room temperature. Full bodied, lightly carbonated, lingering dry and bitter finish.","  rDev Review of the 2018 vintage, Poured cold from 12-ounce bottle into a large snifter. Clear toffee-brown colored body, with a light tan head that took a few minutes to settle into a nice cap. This was allowed to warm to cellar temperature in the glass. Malt-forward aroma, mostly caramel and dark bread. The alcohol is very prominent on the nose as well as the palate. As aggressively hopped as this is, there is a ton of resiny bitterness that coats the tongue and lingers on the finish. Some cellaring might mellow this out somewhat. As is, it's still a very good beer.","  rDev 2015 batch poured into a snifter. Beautiful on the pour - a clear amber-ruby color in the glass with a thick off-white head that lingered and slowly receded. Caramel, toffee, pine, and resin on the nose. The taste was rounded out with pine, bitter orange peel, caramel, and toffee all mingled together. A full bodied malty finish. Outstanding.","  rDev I will be doing this review in the form of a side-by-side comparing the 2014 to the 2020 vintage. The score represents the 2020 vintage, as it's the one I personally prefered.  Upon pouring there really isn't that much of a difference in the look, with the 2014 managing a somewhat surprising amount of frothy head and even some carbonation bubbles, as well as a near identical deep copper coloration, although it is also noticeably less clear, looking a bit more turbid with plenty of tiny floaties visible when held up to the light. Upon final pour, the 2020 maintains some dulled clarity, while the 2014 turns completely murky.  As expected the nose is a LOT more hoppy for the 2020, which features some grainy, caramel malt, but also noticeable citrus and pine aromas, with much lighter dark fruit. The 2014 turns this on its head, with a much richer and sweeter caramel malt and dark fruit/red berry presence almost reminiscent of a sherry, which also makes this feel a bit more boozy, although the merest hint of pine is still detectable as well.  The taste is very much a continuation of the nose, with the 2020 being a LOT more hoppy, with a much stronger bitterness and some zesty grapefruit and resinous pine notes, although also displaying some caramel malt and much lighter dark fruit, with hints of plum and figs. The 2014 is naturally a lot more sweet and malty, with richer and more complex dark fruit and red berry notes of plum, fig, dates, redcurrant and lighter cherry, while almost completely lacking the citrus and pine elements, although the pine is still somewhat evident as a faint echo in the aftertaste. The much increased sweetness adds some honey and brown sugar notes, while the more complex dark fruit and berry notes manifest themselves in a certain sherry character, which makes it feel a bit more boozy in the aftertaste as well.  Body and mouthfeel seem very much identical, with not much of a real difference identifiable. The 2014 may feel just a tad richer, perhaps, although this may well be my imagination based on expectations.  Overall, this makes for a somewhat predictable side-by-side, with the 2020 being a lot more hoppy and bitter and the 2014 being a lot more malty and sweet, with a somewhat greater complexity but also poorer balance for my personal taste. While the results may be predictable, it's still quite intriguing to experience how much a beer like this can change over 6 years and I think that Bigfoot is the perfect example of this because it is such a bold and hoppy American Barleywine when fresh that pretty much turns into an English Barleywine as it ages, while still managing to hold on to some faint echoes of that hoppiness.  I have a feeling that I will go very much against popular opinion when I say that I enjoyed the 2020 a lot more than the 2014, but then again I always prefered American over English Barleywines and the 2014 is just too sweet for me, while I'm also not a big fan of that somewhat oxidized Sherry character that makes it feel more boozy somehow. While the 2014 certainly has a greater complexity to it, it feels more one-dimensional at the same time, because that additional depth almost exclusively brings more sweetness to the beer, while I personally much prefered that sharp contrast of sweet and bitter notes that the 2020 offers, with the caramel malt and dark fruits being very nicely balanced against bitter, resinous hops and citrus fruit here.","  rDev Poured from a bottle labelled 2017, bottled on 12/28/16 into the test glass A - Beautiful copper color, excellent clarity, rather aggressive carbonation. The cap of off white is creamy and last forever. S - Hot hops in the nose, cascade and burnt butter, notes of toffee, and light charrd oak T - Follows the nose well, no surprises, add to the nose some orange reduction and a bit of light tobacco M - Medium in body, just right in slick feel, Carbonation does an excellent job cleaning up O - A classic for sure, I expect this will simmer down with a year or two resting.","  rDev This '18 version pours a deep mahogany with a lot of lacing . Quite a bit hoppier than I remember ,haven't had one in years. Unmistakably Sierra Nevada -familiar malt and yeast profile. Quite nice for as fresh as it is , a late evening sipper.Will drink a couple more fresh and age the other 3 for something to look forward to. A robust and tasty beer.","  rDev Look: It pours brown with a bit of cloudiness. It has a light brown head that has a soft pillow head. Head retention is excellent.  Smell: It has a Malty Rich aroma that is Bready and caramel. Orange aroma is low. The aromas are well defined.   Taste: It is malty rich with bread and caramel. There is a bit of a citrus flavor with orange being the most prominent. It also has a low level of spice.  Feel: It has a moderately full body that is not quite chewy. The bitterness is moderate and the malt and hops last long into the finish.  Overall: This is an excellent combination of flavors and aromas that makes me want to drink this like a session ale.","  rDev It pours a viscous maroon with a very thin dissipating head. The aroma is bitter and floral with some hints of caramel. The taste is intensely bitter. More floral notes and some slight balance offered by the malts. I'm very surprised by the level of hoppy bitterness given that this is a 2-year old bottle.","  rDev Serving: Bottle 2016 version (Packaged Dec-4-2016) Consumed: Oct-12  A: Pours a fairly clear ruby-copper-brown color with an inch-plus of creamy khaki head that slowly drops to a relatively decent film with confetti lacing.

(4.5)  T: Follows the nose but with a faintly sweeter malt body and stronger hop bitterness. (4.25)  M: Full body with medium carbonation and a slow-rolling malt/hop bittersweet finish. (4.25)  O: Really an excellent beer. I have historically said I didn't like Barleywines. Damn you for proving me wrong, Jacob!!! This is a beautiful beer. It has an amazing aroma that pretty much covers the spectrum of malt flavors. The hops are a nice, bracing contrast to this. The flavor follows suit with a medley of toffee, oak and fruity notes with a bitter bite that cleans up your palate. This one gets great as it warms (and as you warm with it).  A real treat! Looks like I'm going to have to stop avoiding this style. (4.25)","  rDev Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, 9.6% ABV, 90 IBU. Poured deep brown with a two finger off-white head.

What struck me early on as these guys were leading the way with the canning of craft beer, was how similar this beer was to SNPA.

The aroma is a lot of those old school Cascade hop tree and grapefruit feels.   Taste, yeah man, that old school bitterness, aspirin, pine, grapefruit. Slight caramel malt underpinnings hold things together and give it that comfort food vibe like the heartiness of a sturdier, maltier pale ale of yesteryear.

A light citrus, lemon, plus the orange slice.  Light bodied wheat beer with a slight tang.  Not bad, better than expected for a coors product.","  rDev A little sweet compared to some other witbiers, there are noticeable but light flavors of spice, banana, and citrus.

Nothing special but rather enjoyable overall.","  rDev 12oz bottle abandoned at the airport but undamaged and seemingly unspoilt. Seemed silly to throw it away. Why not sample it for science instead? According to the stamp on the neck of the bottle, this is best by January 11, 2021.  Poured into a snifter, this was an opaque, dark tangerine color, with a beige head that noisily vaporized itself from view in seconds. It sounded like rice crispies in milk. Brief appearance of spotty lace.  Nose isn't bad for the style. Coriander, orange peel, earthy wheat.   Taste similar to the smell, but less sharp, more unfocused, than most Belgian wits. I'm guessing it's been dumbed down in this regard for mass appeal.   Midway between light and medium in the body. Mouthfeel isn't unacceptable, but could stand to be a little lighter.  Meh. A mass consumption version of a Belgian with her, which I expected going in. Could stand to be more distinctive, but all those women I see walking into Bennidito's, expecting it to be on tap because they had it there a few years ago and bitching about that no longer being the case, would probably not be so into it if it was closer to a proper wit.","  rDev Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a nice white head and lacing. Smell is wheat,coriander,clove and citrus peel. Taste follows nose , Mouth feel has low medium carbonation,its quenchable and tasted very good on this hot day.","  rDev Bottle. Brewed in the UK. Golden haze. Quickly subsiding head. Light aroma. Mild spice with hints of citrus. An earthy flavour reflecting the smell. Distant orange pith.  Medium body. Provides a tingle on the tongue.

Nothing special but it's a solid beer and is refreshing on a hot day. Enjoyable for what it is, I like it.","  rDev I can see why many people use this as their entry-level Belgian wheat beer. I remember trying this many years ago and wasn’t too impressed at the time but my palate was only used to drinking light beers and basic domestics. This one actually pleasantly surprised me with its taste and balance. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-orange color with a little scant lasting foamy white head and almost no lacing. Smells faintly of some Belgian yeast, banana and clove, hops and malt. Taste follows the nose but the Belgian yeast was not unpleasant at all, and was actually rather muted. I could see how trying this beer on tap with a nice twist of orange peel could be very pleasant. Smooth, mild, thin mouthfeel with good carbonation. All in all, not a bad beer, and one that I would definitely try again especially on tap.","  rDev L- Pale amber, hazy, with some sludge remaining in bottle. Pours with 1Cm+ fine-bibble white head S- Sour orange T- Certainly citrus on the front, some spices on the 2nd mouthful.  F- A bit rich for me, verging to some sweetness as it warms a bit. Make sure you serve and drink well chilled. Rather over-carbonated for my taste, I can feel the swallowed CO2 in my stomach which is pretty weird. O- I feel slightly conned by this beer. Usually I wouldn't buy a Molsen-Coors beer in 100 years. Here they've done what seems increasingly common, a brewery appears to produce a beer styled as if it is from 'XYZ Brewing Company', in this case 'Blue Moon Brewing Company' aka mega-industrial brewers Molson-Coors. It wasn't until I came here I saw the true source, and I got my microscope out to read the back lable to find the facts.  The bottle doesn't have a full list of ingredients and I'm not sure how that's legal. The back lable says it contains barley, wheat and oats, something I can't say I've ever heard of in a European 'white' beer. The front lable says it contains orange peel, but omits to mention it contains coriander which you'll find listed on the brewers website.  BB 30/6/19, 330ml bottle.

Not one I'll be buying again.","  rDev Enjoy by Apr 01 19  Pours a pale yellow-orange with a little over an inch of white head  Smells of slight spice, citrus and wheat  Very mild taste, lightly citrusy in the front end and closes with crisp wheat, not complex by any means  A thin mouthfeel, moderately carbonated  Overall a very pleasant beer that is not extraordinary, but still quite refreshing and enjoyable","  rDev Can poured into a glass  Hazy golden yellow liquid with a creamy three finger white foam cap  Aroma of spices , yeast  Taste is wheat, spices, coriander, orange peel  Light mouthfeel ,suds up nicely   Good beer","  rDev Pours a murky darker golden color. Head retention isn't the best, but it's a white head. Nice carbonation bubbles rising in the glass.  The nose has a weird malty aroma.  Taste is malty strange flavor. Just not quite right.  Body is watery. It's a so so beer. But for a $1 it is good.","  rDev Had it on draft at a local college hang out. I am wondering if it was a somewhat old keg. It was poured into a shaker pint. Decent head but little lacing with a cloudy yellow body.  Smell was nicely fruity. The taste was fruity, sweet and a bit artificial. The lemony fruity taste was somewhat over emphasized. I know I have had this beer where it tasted better and more subtle. I will continue to drink this occasionally. It has the benefit of being easy to find!","  rDev Served from tap into a wheat beer glass at Mickey Spillane's in Eastchester, NY. A: Pours a cloudy, rather orange color with only a short lived white head and spotty lacing. S: Aromas of oranges, honeysuckle, and maybe a touch of cloves/cardamom. T: Flavor more banana, cloves, and spice, but definitely a troubling butteriness. Orange note present, but much less evident than in nose. Light, hard to appreciate bitterness. M: Light to medium bodied with serious, persistent effervescence. Almost pulpy. O: Looks delicious on the commercial, but, unlike it, the head did not make it from tap to table. Smell is largely disconnect from taste. Always concerned about the butteriness which I generally do not appreciate. Could be a function of being served on tap. Will update, should it prove different in subsequent tasting (from a bottle). Orange garnish probably a good idea.","  rDev Cloudy orange yellow color. Aroma is grain,orange peel, a little yeast and malt. It's actually a decent beer, not the best but an alright attempt at the style","  rDev Had several times over the years, in unavoidable circumstances, most recently poured from 12-oz. bottle into tumbler, without an orange slice.  Blue Moon looks nice in the glass, is decently malty, and has good control on the wheat flavor, but is probably better enjoyed with an orange slice.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb May 14, 2018 poured into a wheat beer glass at fridge temp 5.4% ABV. The beer pours barely hazy orange yellow with quickly fading off white head. Just a pencil lead ring of head and no lacing after two minutes. The aroma is faint and brings a little wheat and orange. The taste is mild wheat, a touch of orange and a little sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sharply carbonated and undry in the finish. I find a little flawed stickiness in the finish that is reminiscent of a poorly lagered AAL. It is nicely masked by the wheat and orange. Overall, average. The high carbonation level and aftertaste are my biggest faults.","  rDev Pours orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is fair with no lacing left behind. Aroma is pale, wheat, and biscuit malts, with a squeeze of orange. Flavor profile is orange and lemon zest, with biscuit and pale malts. Nice smoothness between the malts and citrus. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Overall, a straightforward, easy-sipper. The flavor and aroma come off as slightly artificial and harsh, but otherwise smooth.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Can - pours a clouded light gold with a puffy 1 finger white cap which lasts well and laces the glass walls. Aroma of pungent cereals, light coriander seed notes and lemon grass, clean aroma. Flavor is biscuit malts with coriander-spicy balance, fair bittering - goes to spicy, lightly bitter dry finish. Dusty biscuit malt character, coriander not overpowering, dry, refreshing but satisfying - decent enough witbier, not over the top - I was surprised this came from Molsons.","  rDev ** 01/11/2018  Bottle to pint glass. (no orange slice)  LOOK: Hazy yellow, small but lasting creamy head. AROMA: it's got that wheat-egg thing going on, but not horrendous. TASTE: crisp malty grains , lemon,  FEEL: Very creamy, medium body, average carbonation.   Despite being a mass produced beer, I still enjoy this (even without the orange slice). Very creamy and easy drinking with adequate flavor.   **","  rDev Honestly this isn't a bad witbier, it's not to style though. Much sweeter than normal with a bit more orange and a muted coriander. I honestly don't really like the style too much because I find a lot of them overly spiced. This one doesn't have that problem. It's not a great beer, but I'd drink it if it were my only non adjunct lager option."]},{"Name":"Double Jack","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2210/50697/","Brewery":"Firestone Walker Brewing Co.","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":9.50,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev Big. bold up front aroma and taste, but goes down easy.

Just buy this beer, it's worth it  Dangerously drinkable, indeed","  rDev There was a time the quality of a brew with the Firestone Walker label went unchallenged. Recently, there have been rumors heard that may no longer be true. This investigation begins by pouring two 12 oz. cans into a clear glass liter mug. A pretty pour it is. The color is a bright and nearly translucent copper. Well carbonated, a small enduring head is joined by good glass lacing and noticed. Not pungent, there is a soft aroma of malt and hops around the glass. Wonderfully drinkable, this does everything a great DIPA should. It's malt forward is velvety, slightly sweet, perfectly carbonated and earthy the way only barley can deliver. At the finish, the hops rule the taste. Nicely complex, they are a little fruity and mostly piney at the finish. There is a taste contribution from the alcohol that isn't distracting and belongs within a good American Double IPA. So much for rumors.","  rDev Appearance: Clear and golden-hued, slim, off-white head, long-lasting.  Aroma: Dank and pungent. Wide open and fuming with fruity and floral aromatics, crackling with hop bitterness. Citric fruits aplenty, with tropical, as well. Stone fruit, too. Orange and lemon meet mango and apricot. Lovely stuff.  Let's drink! That cornucopia of the aroma is plump on the palate, with hop bitterness hanging in close on the side. Just about perfect. Several ounces in, and the booze rises up. It sits happily in the mouth, and causes no fuss, just the general happy feelings we associate it with. Ah, yes. And, yum, yum.  Beautiful fruit, beautiful booze, beautiful bitterness. Mmm, yes. Soft mouthfeel, brilliant hoppy texture, long finish. How many ways do I love this wonderful beer? How many ways are there?","  rDev This can was only a month old so I had to buy one to revisit.

This ale is dry, medium-bodied with lively carbonation, and its 9.5% ABV is potent but not overwhelming. Overall, it is a well-crafted and extremely good DIPA. It deserves its world-class rating.

Aromas of big, sticky caramel malt dance with heavy grapefruit and prickly pine presence; slight general citrus, but the pine/caramel malt combination is intense and dominates the overall bouquet casually.  Taste shows pine and caramel malt hitting first, but soon balance out with hop spice and minor citrus tones; generally more fruit-forward than the decidedly piney-malty aroma; lightly flambéd grapefruit and bitter hops are more pronounced easing into the finish.  Mouthfeel has a body on the lighter side of medium accompanied by carbonation that’s lower than expected, with a malty crispness and light grit standing in; clean, but the malt and hops carry noticeably through the finish with a bitterness that doesn’t fall out of balance.  Another quality IPA from Victory; this one just kills it with the caramel malt aromatics, and dries out along the way with just enough piney bitterness and citrus to leave the overall product vibrant; as with most of their IPAs, I could return to this one easily.","  rDev One of those beers I've had 100 times, but somehow don't have a review.

Starts hoppy and slightly sweet, balancing toward bitter hips/sweet malt in the middle, gravitating slowly towards bitter again in the finish but transitioning t o a full bitter hop bite and slightly astringent aftertaste.

There is a thick off-white head with thick lacing.  The smell explodes with citrus hops but there is also a strong malt backbone.  The taste is deep, bitter pine hops with a decent malt backbone. There is not a lot of citrus that comes through in the taste, just tons of bitter, floral hops.  The mouthfeel is thick with medium carbonation.  Overall this is good but a bit more floral hops than I expected from the smell.","  rDev L: Clear amber with a tight beige head. Moderate retention, with some splotchy lacing.  S: Super sweet toasty malt, tons of caramel and toffee and toasted brown bread. There's a little bit of grapefruit juice and woody, pine as well, but it's mostly tons of malt.  T: Caramel, toffee, and toasted bread throughout. There is a little bit of grapefruit juice and grapefruit in the mid-palate, but overall this is cloying. There's some earthy and piney bitterness near the finish, but that cloying caramel malt just sticks hard.  F: Medium-bodied, medium-carbonated, very sticky with all the residuals sugars.  O: Not my cup of tea. This is bad IPA, in my honest opinion. Victory makes a ton of great beer and I love most of it, but this is not one of them.","  rDev This beer pours a rich amber with an average head. The aroma is dank and resinous, with pine, cannabis, caramel, and grapefruit pith. The flavor is much the same, dominated by resinous flavors of pine and cannabis, and highlighted by bitter grapefruit peel. The bitterness is nice and high, and well contrasted by malt. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and sticky. Overall this is a true classic IPA, with sticky, rich, piney flavors.","  rDev Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass at Taco Mac in Peachtree City. The appearance is a slightly cloudy copper color with a medium sized off-white colored head. The aroma is citrus hops. The taste is similar to the nose, citrus and some slight malt in the background. An excellent IPA.","  rDev Had many times... this particular tasting was poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish tulip. I've always been a fan of the devil du hops artwork.  L: Clear copper/caramel pour. Thin off-white head. Spotty lacing.  S: Rich and biscuity grains... pungent pine, grapefruit, and herbal hops.   T/F: Follows the nose. Caramel malts and grains which lead to a big bitter hop profile. Grapefruit and pepper... resinous pine, and a bit herbal. Very assertive... reminds me of baking. Medium body and solid carbonation. Finish is spice and pepper which lingers on the palate.  O: One of my first favorite IPA's, and just as good now with a belated re-visit. I tend to hit Dirtwolf more frequently but you can't go wrong by hitting up the classics. This was the beer that made sitting at Phillies games a joy.","  rDev -deep amber, clear pour.

The head is less than 1/3 . The aroma doesn't pop. Seems like a lager bill hopping.   A good amount of toffee/caramel like malt impressions. The hops just aren't cutting it though given the label and beer name. If you wanna go malty, this might be up your alley.","  rDev For years, this was my go-to beer. Remember being blown away by the hops when I first tried it at Bob and Barbara's in Philly around year 2000. Today, it's not all that outrageous, but you've got to respect your elders and appreciate the classics.  Pours a nice copper color with an off-white head that leaves decent lacing. What I get in the aroma these days is actually a wallop of malty sweetness, but there's fairly grapefruit-ish, earthy hops in there, too. These hops continue to the taste, with a strong malt balance, that's somewhat nutty in character. Medium to heavy bodied for an IPA.  What can I say? The newcomers have surpassed it in the decades that have followed, but this is still a damn good beer. Thank you, Victory.","  rDev Pours deep amber red with a creamy frothy off-white foam head.

Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing.  Faintly boozy aroma, almost RIS-like. A little molasses, faint smoke.  On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue.

This one is a 2018, into a Tallgrass snifter.   Pours a really lovely thick and creamy dark black with a creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a thick bubbly ring with bubbles on top. Sparse lacing graces the sides.   Aroma is huge and welcoming. A lot of chocolate with a lot of musty oak barrel. Some hints of port wine, cinnamon, raspberry, and molasses.   Flavor is exactly like I remember it - an overhopped disgusting mess. Piney-bitter to start, then graduates to grassy-bitter, with heavy ethanol and some undertones of roasted malt, oats, and molasses. The  undertones  part is important, because they are completely overshadowed by grass and pine. This is the grassiest  stout  I've ever had in my life. I get a little bit of caramel peeking through too but it's so faint compared to the bitterness. More grass and pine on the finish. Tastes like a QB sack.  Feel is resiny, oily, creamy, and very hot.   How this gets a 99 is beyond me. This is a fucking awful beer. Palate exhaustion after the 3rd sip. An F-, would never ever visit again. I mean, there's a couple redeeming qualities like the look and aroma, but when it falls apart on the tongue, what am I supposed to do?

My first Abyss (after years of chasing) so I’m not sure if this is supposed to be a lean, not-sweet RIS, but it’s showing signs of autolysis.

Bumping overall to 4.25, but I intend to keep revisiting this.","  rDev Look: Appears viscous pouring from the bottle. Pitch black in the glass, with a light brown, craggy, two finger head. The foam settles and leaves a lot of lace in its wake. As I drink down the beer a ton of lacing. Opaque and no visible carbonation.   Smell: Milk chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, raisin, prune, coffee, chocolate covered raspberry jelly rings, plum, chocolate berry cordial.  Taste: The tip of the tongue is sweet cherry, dark chocolate, sweet and juicy plum with some acidity. These sweet and dark fruit notes yield mid palate to the wine barrel influence on the beer. Rich notes of tart blackberry, leather and tobacco. Bitter, toasty, woody and oak forward. The finish on this beer resembles red wine more than most other beers I’ve had.   Feel: Medium carbonation, thick and smooth. The finish is super long, dry, oak-forward and bitter. The bitterness lingers forever.   Overall: I’ve never had Abyss before. Therefore, never had this beer fresh, so I cannot comment on the aging process. But, I can state that this beer is clean and enjoyable with no off flavors. The red wine influence here is prominent, enjoyable and cutting edge. This beer actually finishes to me like red wine. It’s so enjoyable, unique and well done.","  rDev I think I have had this beer many times, with many vintages. I have had them fresh, and I have had them aged. And for some reason, I have not reviewed it until today.  So I am rating a vintage bottled on 10/30/17. First pour was from a bottle that had been at room temperature for years and the second pour was after refrigerating for a half hour. I know, not much.  Appearance is a dark brown more than black, with a very frothy and creamy tan foam and lacing. Smell is wet boozy oak and bourbon barrels first, followed by dark fruit (wine grapes and raisins), then mildly sweet vanilla and molasses, and finished with a hint of cherry. The feel is sublime in an excellent way, easily the best thing about the beer. The almost light body and slightly dry finish gel extremely well with the heavy booze presence in a unique fashion. You just don’t expect what you get here.  I will have to try a “fresh” 18 for way of comparison soon. And, of course, buy another to age.  Drinking a 2015 (six year old) bottle. Rich flavors of chocolatey and barrel. Tasty.","  rDev 22oz bottle. Waxed and capped bottle. 2014 vintage. Best after date of '11/10/15'. Black colored body, with a thin brown back lit edge. Two fingers of tan head, which settles down in a few minutes. Leaves spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma of rich dark roasted malts, with dark molasses, black licorice, and barrel touches. Taste emphasizes the molasses and licorice, and ends with a chocolate note. There are small nuances of cherry and vanilla. Dry at the end. Medium plus mouth feel, with a smooth texture. Good carbonation in presentation, but not so much in feel. This beer has aged into a real blend of the dark flavors as dominant. The higher ABV% provides that vapors that sit above the body, but do not burn. These vapors result in clearer nasal passages. Quite easy to drink, and because the end is so dry, the urge is to take another sip (or medium quaff). Barrel expression is minimal, but I do get a touch of the oak wine barrel. Bitterness is less than medium, and is a little surprising considering the dense dark smells and flavors.","  rDev 2014 Reserve, 11.1%.","  rDev The abyss pours a black color, small lacong tan head.

A very nice beer although less depth of flavor than expected. I'd like to try one that fresher to compare.","  rDev A very nice imperial stout but the stronger flavors of raisin and licorice were just a little too much for me. Pours a deep, rich dark black color with great dark tan head and sheets of lacing. Smells of deep rich chocolate and coffee, along with fainter dark stone fruit, malt and caramel. Tastes of deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate mocha, vanilla, caramel, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, malt and licorice. Just too much raisin and licorice for me.

Poured from the 2012 bottling, 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. Consumed on 7/29/17.  A: Very dark brown and opaque, with a thin tan head that lasts quite well. A fairly low amount of visible carbonation.  S: Sweet malts and oak, bourbon and chocolate. Tannins and vanilla, with some tobacco and licorice. Leather and cacao powder. Smells quite good and fairly complex.  T: Chocolate, roasted malts, and bourbon. Oak, vanilla, and some char with a mild smoke character. Tobacco and anise. Dry tannins and a mild coffee. Roasted bitterness, with a milder amount of hop bitterness, and sweet chocolate in hang.  M: A medium body for an Imperial Stout. Low carbonation overall, but probably average for style. The alcohol presence is restrained for the style, but certainly still warming.  O: Very enjoyable. The roasty and char and anise aspects add up to maybe not blowing me out of the water, but remains interesting, enjoyable, and complex. Big roastiness for sure though. In the interest of full disclosure, this my opinion of this may have suffered a bit from being drank directly after the Cycle DB Vanilla DOS.","  rDev Happy birthday to me! Not only is it my birthday, but I’ve also got a beer I’ve been waiting to get my hands on since I joined BeerAdvocate and began my craft journey all the way back on Jan 13th 2011: Deschutes The Abyss. Even saying the name of this beer out loud fills me with a sense of awe (and trepidation at the 11.4% ABV within) this brew is going to be BIG in so many ways, with headline ingredients such as: black strap molasses, licorice, cherry bark, vanilla bean, and 50% aged in bourbon, wine, and new Oregon oak barrels - PHWOAR! Let me repeat myself for emphasis: PHWOAR! The only [first-world] problem I’m facing is the prospect of finishing off a 650ml bottle by myself... yes, it’s not a terrible situation to be in.  Poured from a 650ml US Bomber sized wax-sealed bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Inky black like the expansive vacuum of space, with a deep tan head that hangs around for as long as I’ve seen in any Stout north of 11% before fizzling out leaving a patchwork of bubble and lace. Peering down into the glass is like looking at a mini universe - epic in many ways this beer. 9/10.  S: Red wine really comes through in the first whiff, then licorice, molasses, dark fruits (plum and prune), oaky vanilla/woody tones, espresso coffee, and finally a sweet lick of bourbon. Incredibly complex aroma that shifts as it gets warmer - it’s hard not to like it, there’s something in this that every Stout drinker will like, and the name is fitting - it really is like peering into the abyss. 9/10.  T: Yep, Deschutes nailed it. Flavour incorporates all of the above: red wine (Shiraz I think), licorice, molasses, dark fruits, oaky vanilla/woody tones, espresso coffee, and a touch of bourbon. Then it throws in a bit more: burnt sugar, light bitter herbal notes, red coffee cherries, touch of smoke and a hint of cinnamon. Possibly one of the busiest Imp Stouts I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. Balances a tad on the sweeter side, though more herbal bitterness comes through in the aftertaste with a delayed reaction. Brutal and inspiring this brew is. 10/10.  M: Heavy bodied and viscous, it’s about a Barry White on the Founders Scale IMO. Carbonation is dying star dense and lush almost to a fault. 9/10.  D: As I imagined all these years? Yes, this beer terrifies in name and in taste - it’s every bit the behemoth I dreamt it would be, and Deschutes does not disappoint. As far as the bottle goes - I am going to struggle on my own, this is too big a brew for one man, but I’ll go down fighting the good fight ;). 9/10.  Food match: Replace the after dinner port with this beer, and cigars: yes.","  rDev Thick, dark, black color from a tall beer. The aroma is incredible....chocolate, licorice, and more. Smokey.

T: grassy-herbal hop pop up front, with a big fruity back-flow; aftertaste is (again) like a fruity muffin, more fragrant (orange) fruit than cakey malt; rather bready grain flavors linger... each sip full of flavor; mellow spicy buzz  F: despite the head falling out, don't be fooled - healthy infusion of gas in this one... the body has a subtle doughy chew to it, no doubt greased by hop resins... do love a domestic wheat with substance and sudsy sizzle  O: before this moment, had Oberon maybe once over the past decade, but several times when I'd first encountered it... not sure exactly how old this can is - quick search of batch finder on Bell's site didn't return any results... at any rate, one of the better (widely-available) American wheat beers; could easily have several in succession (1443)","  rDev 12 oz bottle, packaged on 4/15/19.  Pours hazy, medium amber with a decent sized white head that fizzles out fairly quickly. Huge orange citrus notes in the aroma. Pretty impressive that they get that level of orange aroma without using orange peel or actual fruit. Some wheat, coriander, and floral hops gently make their presence known. The wheat is stronger in the flavor but it is also very fruity tasting. Medium-light bodied and refreshing.   An easy drinking beer that is best suited for warm weather. Made a nice pairing for some leftover ribeye steak and salmon that we put into tacos.","  rDev Pours a near-murky orange with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is solid. Aroma is wheat, straw, pale, bready, earthy malts with a hint of citrus and earthy hops. Balance leans towards malty with the hops subtly perking up the back end. Flavor profile is citrus and wheat, striking a wonderful balance. Orange slice meets wheat, earthy, bready malts at the start before breaking way into a more malty, sweet finish. A touch of lemon zest adds just a bit of complexity and nuance. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a soft, pulpy texture that adds a little to the experience without becoming heavy. Overall, solid wheat ale with some citrus for balance and sweetness. Nothing bold or outlandish, just a well-controlled, modest beer with a twinge of sweetness.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can.","  rDev Served on draft in a 22 oz (650 ml) tall conical at Carson's American Bistro in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A: Poured a hazy, sunny golden orange with emphasis on the latter, a 2 finger, foamy, downright fluffy, white head, with extraordinary retention, and rings and rings of sticky, complex lacing. S: Aromas relatively light but I picked up caramel, citrus, and cream. T: Semisweet (lightly so). Flavors follow the caramel and citrus. Very mellow melon (somewhere between cantaloupe and honeydew). Light bitterness (barley perceived it). M: Medium bodied with strong and persistent carbonation. Creamy, smooth, and rich. O: This beer is gorgeous. I did not have it in the bottle, so my view could differ from that. I could not believe how smooth and satisfying it was on tap. It helps when Bell's is literally less than 100 miles away.","  rDev Bottled 2/18/16; drank 3/31/16 @ the Yarchives.   Opaque bright orange appearance.   A rough pour yielded a nice bright white head; nice frothy lace.   Orange peel &amp; soft wheat notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Orange peel flavor up front; honeyed wheat notes on the finish.   A simple, enjoyable session ale; a golf course beer if there ever was one. I'd have another.","  rDev Canned April 24th 2019.  Pours a lightly hazed orange yellow with a massive head of foam that shrinks but doesn't dissipate entirely.   The nose has some wheat, sweetish to earthy malt, and some citrus hoppiness.   I taste wheat, earthy malt, some bread, and a mild citrus hop bite. Very smooth but not lacking in flavour.   Just the right mouthfeel for the style..not too spritzy, not too heavy.   Finally got to try it and I am pleased as punch.","  rDev Pours a bright gold unfiltered, not much head.  Smells of wheat and banana, like a hefeweizen.  Taste is kind of a sweet wheat, again more banana. A bit of pepper too.  Nice silky smooth mouthfeel.","  rDev 12oz can received courtesy of ovaltine and his NBS BIF assault upon my porch, refrigerator and liver. Canned March 19 2019 per the stamp on the bottom of the can.  Poured into a shaker pint glass, this was a slightly hazy amber color, with a decent sized off-white head. Spotty lace.  Slightly earthy aroma of wheat, as expected. Initially, there was a very faint sweet aroma reminiscent of coriander, which surprised me, given it's not a Bavarian hefeweizen. Weirdly, as it warmed it receded, as the wheat aroma became more assertive.  Wheat flavor up front, but.it's fairly subtle, as is a.sweetness that comes in about midway through that is almost barely perceptible. There's also a very subtle spiciness that reminds me a tiny bit of a peppery hoppiness, but it's hugely dialed back. Very modest dryness at the swallow.  Light bodied, with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.  It's ironic to say so, but this beer SCREAMS  subtle.  It is so laid back, refreshing, and seemingly content with what it is that despite it not being much of a flavor bomb, you can't help liking it a lot. It puts to shame all of the regional beers of the style (Pyramid, I'm especially looking at you), I think because the hoppiness is more low key, letting the other elements shine out a bit more. In summer, while doing outdoorsy things, I'd drink the shit outta this. Thanks, Mike!","  rDev Pours a cloudy orange with a minimal tan head that disappears quickly. Aroma of and tan brown sugar and orange. Taste is sweet. Good mouth feel. A summer standard.","  rDev Clearly out of season, but whatever - I'm giving it a try... Medium-gold and clear with a coupla fingers of white head... Has a mild citrus and gentle spice character - kicks off herbal and floral aromas... Feel is smooth but lively, amply carbonated, mildly sweet, mildly bitter... Very easy to drink...   Definitely not my style but a decent enough beer for what it is...","  rDev Pours a cloudy golden color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. A wheat and citrus aroma. A little grainy and spicy. Taste is a little off. Wheat and grain. Some citrus and mild spiciness. Honey? Light bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation.","  rDev Cloudy orange yellow color . Body is at least a medium with about average carbonation . Aroma is grain / wheat, honey, yeast, but the aroma is subdued. Taste is very similar to the aroma, much more bitter than the aroma hints at but not off putting. The wheat is more subtle than most wheat beer but it does come through. It is not overly complex but still flavorful and makes for an easy to enjoy beer. Goes well with food as it isn't too strong on it's own that it takes away from anything else","  rDev A: crystal clear; deep gold in color; 1+ finger ivory head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;  S: grainy and doughy with a bit of malt sweetness and floral hops;  T: doughy for a moment, then grainy with a little sweetness through the finish; very mild bitterness at the end;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; lightly dry finish;  O: easy drinking;","  rDev $12 for a sixer of this locally. Hazy, cloudy look with many large chunks of particulates floating around like pieces of cheese - not appealing in the least bit. Mild, rather nondescript grainy aroma. Taste is citrusy, lacking the spice that one would generally expect from the style. Mouthfeel is on the creamier side. Overall, not bad but not great - perhaps it would benefit from the addition of some spices, it's pretty bland tasting.","  rDev A: Pours a golden yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing  S: Light fruit and wheat notes as well as some bready notes and spicy hops  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the wheat and bready malt notes and then goes into some fruitiness and spicy hop notes. Finishes with lingering wheat and some yeasty undertones  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A solid summer wheat ale that is super drinkable","  rDev Very nice, refreshing, drinkable wheat beer - I thoroughly enjoyed it even though wheat beers are typically not my cup of tea. Nice hazy golden color with some nice head and lingering lacing. Smells of wheat, citrus fruit and some grain. Tastes similarly, along with some caramel and nice malt backbone. Perfect balance of sweetness and that wheat aftertaste. Mild mouthfeel with good carbonation. A very refreshing, sessionable beer.","  rDev nice bready wheat and spice character","  rDev Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.  Pours a hazy bright orange gold color with 3 fingers of fluffy off-white head. The head slowly dissipates into a thick blanket of foam, leaving plenty of sticky cobwebs of lacing along the way. Beautiful beer.  The aroma is very bready and yeasty, with notes of lemon, grass, and subtle notes of clove and spicy hops.  The flavor is more of the same. Lots of wheat bread and yeast. Some citrus rind and spicy hops.   The feel is medium-light with moderate carbonation. Refreshing and highly drinkable.  Overall, a pretty good beer that's entirely underwhelming, but it's drinkable as hell and I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they were going for here.","  rDev From the 5 Liter Can, it pours a hazy amber with a nice head that lasts and lasts. It also leaves lacing as you enjoy it. Bread and a bit of spice in the nose. ...and the mouth. Nice!","  rDev 12oz bottled on 3/18/18 Pours a hazed gold/amber color beer with a 1/2  off white head and short retention. Wheat. Orange-y. Yeast.  Taste follows the nose, it's not simple or complex...somewhere in the middle with definitely enough to keep interest and come back for more. Full bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Clean and finishes quick and dry...a plus.","  rDev Yeah, like Alexis Ren's instagram, I'm into it. Bright orangish hue like I feel F.W. Murneau's masterpiece, Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans would look like if it was shot in technicolor. Taste is like waking up next to Alesandra Ambrosio on a cloudy day, and then having her freshly squeeze you some orange juice - I can get used to this. It's not the most vibrant, it doesn't speak to me like Sartre at midnight, but it is there and proud. And that is enough for the Raul man.","  rDev Late Check-in of this beer from Town Center Tap House, Daleville, VA. July 1, 2014. Lost in the archives... Day of the unfortunate US loss to Belgium in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.","  rDev Poured into a half pint glass: color is straw, a light haziness, head is brighter white with fine to small bubbles; head lingers very well with good solid top and lacing on glass sides.   Smell is pleasant blend of light citrus, with a lean towards orange zest, and biscuit/wheat malt.  Taste is very good with a great wheat/biscuit flavor, solid hop spice and delicious orange/citrus zestiness.  Mouthfeel is crisp, moderately carbonated, starts with a fuller presence then has a lingering dry/spiciness on the tongue.  Overall: a very good wheat beer with pronounced citrus and wheat flavors, light hop spice and dryer mouthfeel.","  rDev Hazy orange color with a very thin head. Aroma with predominant notes of sour dough and c vitamin. Flavor with notes of pine, orange with soda, spicy yeast, distant mango and drops of lemon. Dry aftertaste with a low to medium bitterness. Light body with appropriate carbonation. Piney, yeasty and mildly sour American Wheat Ale. Very refreshing and subtle differentiates  from the crowd.","  rDev Pale golden color, hazy, lots of floaties some of which gradually sink and create a layer on the bottom of the glass. Tall head, creamy white, that recedes slowly leaving some lacing. Wheat odor, with perhaps a bit of orange or lemon. Lemon / orange taste, like the aroma. Mildly bitter aftertaste. Nicely balanced. A light-drinking summer beer, with a pleasant lemon flavor, but not my favorite summer beer."]},{"Name":"Speedway Stout","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/396/3833/","Brewery":"AleSmith Brewing Company","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":12.00,"Score":97.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled in a big bomber and purchased from Cafe Beermoth  Pours a jet black body with big thick tan head  Aroma is good filter mocha’d up Flavour is coffee can irished up","  rDev Appearance - Pours a dark jet cola brown with two fingers of bubbly mocha tan head.  Smell - earthy and leafy hops, bitter coffee bean, cocoa, milk and dark chocolate, toffee, plum, raisin, caramel, roasted malts, alcohol warmth, and earthy yeast.  Taste - earthy and leafy hops upfront then quickly goes into the bitter coffee bean, cocoa, milk and dark chocolate. The toffee, plum, raisin, and caramel follow suit. The roasted malts, and earthy yeast round out the brew. The alcohol is there but is disguised within the complexity of flavours.   Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate to full carbonation.

S: Roasty, earthy, a little char, a hint of smoke, slight herbal notes, solid hit of coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, and a touch of toffee sweetness.

O: Probably the first big imperial stout I ever had back in the day when I was really getting into craft beer, before I joined BA, so it's nice to do a proper revisit and review. Just as good as I remember it. Glad to see the legend lives on.","  rDev Black, deep and dark, completely opaque body topped by a khaki head, tall with excellent retention, thick and creamy. A thick wall of lacing is left as it does recede.  Aroma is not strong: roasted coffee, chocolate, and slightly sweet.  Initial taste is vanilla, followed by roasted coffee, then chocolate, then the bitterness from the hops. All of this intermingles nicely throughout. The underlying sweetness of the malts is never more than a background foundation. The foremost flavors are the interacting of chocolate and roasted coffee. The finish is bitter, with the aftertaste being somewhat sweet and bitter with roasted coffee. The bitterness and the roasted malts linger. This is a big beer, but, apart from the expected effects, the alcohol does not become obvious until near the end, when the beer has become well-warmed to room temperature, and even then, it is just a bit of warming at the finish.  The mouth feel is smoothly creamy and moderately thick.  Overall, excellent. The story of this beer is complex malty goodness with coffee. The coffee is not overbearing and integrates nicely into the other flavors.","  Rerate bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. The aroma and flavour has notes of heavily roasted malts and strong coffee. Maybe not one of the most complex beers in the world, but still one of the best! I’m upping it a point or two. Original rating: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Pitch black colour. Intense but pleasant roasty aroma and flavour, notes of leather and tar.","  rDev A handcrafted pour of a pint can into a clear Imperial pint glass quickly showed some positive characteristics. Not surprisingly, the ale is the color of black coffee. Its head may be more of a light brown than a tan. It was pretty, but not long lasting. A very pleasant aroma of roasted malt and coffee fills the air. Plenty of lacing trails the head and liquid down the glass. The taste starts rich and semisweet and transforms to rich and bittersweet at the finish. Not one of the contributors dominants this wonderful combination of roasted malt, coffee, hops and even alcohol. Of which, there's just enough at both ends to compliment the others. This drinks nowhere near its ABV. More evidence this is a leading brewery.","  rDev I've had this brew and its variants a number of times in the past but somehow never reviewed it. This can is just about 13 months old.  Overall this is a great coffee stout. At a year its coffee punch has lost a step but it's still a wonderfully bitter coffee stout balanced nicely by a dark dried fruit character. Still the deepest black with a mocha head that is really impressive for the style. Coffee is still strong and lovely on the nose. Taste shows the first hints of staling but is still quite lovely with coffee and dark fruits and a sharp leather note. Mouthfeel is excellent. Full without being syrupy","  rDev This is one that has been on my radar since I was a baby advocate. It was nine bucks for a pint can at Total Wine, and still a no brainer. Gigantic, crushing, immovable head. Big, creamy roasted malt flavors in the nose and obsidian black body.   Definitely takes a minute to register the many stations of the taste. The first is the obvious roasted malt nots of coffee and baker's chocolate, delivered with a potent but brief blast of alcohol before smoothing out to give a finish of dark berries, cocoa, resin and light smoke.   Not the kind of beer for regular occasions, but definitely worth it if you have not given it a go.","  rDev Poured from a bottle that's been in the fridge for a couple of years - dark as night with short khaki head leaving minimal lacing . Nose is roasty malt, whiffs of coffee ,cocoa and earth. Taste follows with hints of sweetness and a bit of bite. Finish is smooth, almost creamy. Outstanding.","  rDev From the can (though we are used to the bottle) in a snifter. This BEAST of a legend pours a coal black with a nice head of brown foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping pool, and shows nice lacing. Nose of rich coffee, char, roast, brulee,  dark fruit, and strong astringent booze. Flavors nail the note I look for in an imperial stout; strong coffee, rich char, brulee, tobacco, vinous notes, medium to medium strong herbal hop elements, dark fruit notes of black and blueberry,  and medium booze notes. Excellent mouth feel; full body, smooth, rich as can be, warming, coating, light carbonation with just enough lift, and a warming boozy finish.  Overall, a LEGEND in brewing from a fantastic brewery!  Cheers","  rDev Pours dark black with a tan head.Smell is milk chocolate,coffee and roasted malts. Taste has a darker chocolate and coffe. Mouth feel is smooth and delicious ABV well hidden.","  rDev CAN Solid sepia carpet of a head over thick jet black; raisin, dark chocolate, a bit of soy, stale espresso, Marmite on the nose; fig rolls, ash, licorice, dried black currants, but then shifts into some dark toffee, strong latte, cacao nibs, walnut oil, with a chewy rugelach end and a touch of grounds; medium-full, warming, dead smooth.   4 4.5 4.25 4.5 4.25  Been sitting on this for a year or three. On first taste, I was worried it was past its best: a lot of black notes like treacle, with specks of savoury like soy that suggest the start of autolysis.  But as it opens, it mellows into more refined richness: biscotti, moccachino, nutella. Coffee is down in the mix compared to what I’d expect - is that age? On the up, little bits like vanilla poke their head up when you least expect. But the real trick here, though, is that the 12% is buried like a secret.  A rabbit hole of flavors. Not so much layered - I doubt it’s a complex malt bill - as a solid slab of obsidian that looks different as you hold it up to the light.   I’ve chased this one for a while and I’m not disappointed. Deserves its place in the pantheon of American imperial stouts.","  rDev Unknown vintage; drank 9/13/15 @ the Palace.   Black/brown appearance.   Tan head; a curtain of lace.   Coffee, milk chocolate &amp; banana notes in the nose.   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Fresh roasted coffee bean &amp; milk chocolate flavors up front; banana notes on the finish. No booze heat.   A balanced, delicious dessert treat.","  rDev Well slap me on the ass and call me Wilbur. Raul finally tries regular Speedway? Let’s go.  Right off the bat, well, it’s a bleeder back to the mound. I don’t really get much out of the aroma - and that’s more disappointing than a Demi Moore nudie scene. Next.  Taste is pretty big. Like, that damn Randy’s donut ‘big.’ Damn sucker slaps you harder on the face with rich Stout and coffee notes like Oprah attacking her morning porridge.  Body is nice. Bridget Bardot for you geezers. But for the young bucks (like Raul) think Margot Robbie pouring you a cup of joe in her best dainties - yeah, I like dat.  Not the best Stout. Pretty damn good for being year round, but I don’t really see myself craving it like my baby mama in her Sunday best.  Peace!","  rDev I'd love to try more variants as they add complexity, but it's the barrel aging that brings this Speedway to life.","  rDev Reviewed from long-standing notes. Poured from the 750mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. 2016 vintage bottle, consumed 8/23/17.  A: Dark - essentially black - and opaque. Forms a small tan head, and has minimal if any visible carbonation.  S: Coffee, roasted malts, the darkest of cacao. Notes of caramel, vanilla, and leather. A mild char to the malt roastiness. Very nice.  T: Coffee, dark chocolate, mocha. Dark, dark roasted malts, dry tobacco and still the mild char. Notes of vanilla and caramel, and the caramel increases as the beer warms through the drink. A modest hop and roast bitterness at the swallow, but ultimately outlasted by chocolate-sweet malts.  M: A good heft to the body for an Imperial stout. Low but as-expected carbonation, and the alcohol is very, very well-hidden.  O: Wow. Very nice and complex flavors, of which most (other than the coffee) are not additive-derived.

But I think a nice spring day is an occasion enough.  Actually I was waiting for someone ti share it with, I didn't find someone worthy enough.  As i pour from the easy looking 1 pt 9.4 fl. oz. I can see a a gorgeous pitch black body. As it goes it forms a nice beige head  Now I can make an aproach with my big white nose and smell the beauty. I can tell you right now, this is the best part of the beer. What's amazing is that vanilla is all around in this coffee imperial stout. Ok coffee is there too. In a latte form. Caramel, chocolate, and a certain je ne sais quoi.  As my tongue comes across the ale, it shows its balance with a soft sweetness. The roasty bitterness does the rest. The hops are still present with a bergamote/earl grey presence alongside blueberries.   The smooth mouthfeel brings just what you need to compliment the flavours.   This is one of the first coffee imperial stout. It's nothing compared to what coffee beers are right now. This is no pastry stout. This is a beer. This a much refined beer.","  rDev Brilliant black pour with white pillowy head for days. Aromas of dark chocolate and French roast coffee. Flavors of coffee, toffee, and dark fruit flavors.

Extremely creamy mouthfeel.","  rDev I think this is the best imperial stout I have ever had to date. Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Pitch brown with a great beige head and lacing. Wonderful smell of dark berries and chocolate. Carries to the taste, but so much more. Hint of coffee, almonds, dark toasted malt, dates, dark raisins. All this without being too sweet. These guy hit a beer sweet spot!","  rDev I think Ale Smith Speedway Stout with Coffee had just the right amount of coffee flavor. It was not overwhelming and tasted like  normal  but strong stout. It was very good.

Feel: medium to full body","  rDev Black with a creamy tan head. Heavy, sticky lacing.   Strong roasted malts, a little cream and a faint whiff of alcohol in the nose. Whatever coffee is there is very muted.  In the taste the nice roasted malt flavors are coupled with a strong sweetness -- there's a bit of chocolate and cream to it, but it's straight-up sugary, too. I wouldn't call it a dessert stout, but it's close. The coffee isn't very forward at this age, but there is a tasty flash of it in the aftertaste.  Very thick, creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation.  This is a bit too sweet for me to revisit often, but it's still very solid. Hard to read the canned on date, but it looks like 1/24/17, which could account for the muted coffee.","  rDev Poured to an Ora et Labora taster.  A: The body is not very syrupy when pouring, was expecting a bit more for the given alcohol contents. The body is pitch black and the head is beige to faded yellow. Not much retention nor lacing. S: The aroma is very very roasty, with tons of chocolate, coffee, caramel and even a bit of vanilla. The aroma is pure awesomeness. T: Following the aroma, starts off with a vanilla-like and caramel sweetness profile. Right after, a milk chocolate and sweet coffee is present with a very prominent style. In the end, a slight sweet end turns this beer so awesome and drinkable. M: Body is medium high, carbonation is high, sweetness is high but alcoholic contents are too prominent. O: It's true, this is classic beer. Truly awesome.","  rDev Welcome to The CANQuest (tm), Sppedway Stout! This was a relatively spendy CAN, but since I have been spending the day drinking &amp; reviewing Stouts, I decided to bring this one into the fore.   From the CAN:  Speedway Stout's ominous, pitch black appearance has become a hallmark of the modern-day classic. Chocolate and roasted malts dominate the flavor, supported by notes of dark fruit, toffee, and caramel. A healthy dose of locally-roasted coffee added to each batch brings out the beer's dark chocolate flavors and enhances its drinkability. Despite its intensity, Speedway Stout's fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel make it very smooth and surprisingly easy to drink. This beer ages very well and will continue to mature for many years to come. ;  This beer's great balance makes it a very food-friendly imperial stout. Pair its roasty flavors and robust mouthfeel with rich beef dishes and char-grilled foods. Both chocolate and vanilla desserts also pair well, as do salty blue cheeses like Stilton or hard nutty cheeses like aged Gouda and cloth-bound Cheddars.   I Crack!ed this bad boy open, but as much as I wanted to do an inverted Glug, its price tag &amp; quantity (16-fl. oz.) held me back from anything more than a slow pour. It did not matter as its intense carbonation immediately led to the formation of two fingers of dense, foamy, light-brown head with great retention. Color was absolutely Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Jeez-O, man, this was sucking the light out of the room! Nose smelled intensely of rich, black coffee, the kind that must be coaxed into my coffee pot each morning as the filter clogs due to the amount of grounds that I use. I am a retired U.S. Navy sailor &amp; I still run on smokin' coffee. Sure, there was also dark chocolate, light smoke &amp; the dried, dark fruits that they mentioned, but coffee was the star of the show. Mouthfeel was thick, full &amp; creamy, just what I had been missing this afternoon. The taste was an instant jumpstart to my heart! Coffee came on strong, followed closely by dark, bittersweet chocolate and then the fruitiness began to open up along with the toffee &amp; caramel flavors. Whee! OMFG. Phew. What a riotous beer! I almost CANnot believe that they deigned to CAN such a beast, but I am not CANplaining. Finish was dry and very coffee-like, just what I had hoped for. Phew! It is only its price point that slows me down from buying additional CANs.","  rDev Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped canning date is sometime in 2017, but otherwise illegible. Pours a pure black body, with bubbly, thick tan head, extensive coverage of lacing. Smells of dark roasts, coffee, chocolate, and slightly sweeter caramel. Taste bursts with dark chocolate and coffee, with roasty and caramel malts at the end. A slight alcohol burn in the noise. Silky, medium, coating mouth feel. Excellent example of an imperial stout with coffee.","  rDev From a can. It pours jet black with a finger worth of tan head. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate with some nice sugary and caramel-like sweetness to it. The taste is of espresso, dark chocolate, and some roasted grains. Very viscous and it coats the tongue nicely. Little in the way of booziness despite the fairly high ABV."]},{"Name":"Parabola","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2210/41815/","Brewery":"Firestone Walker Brewing Co.","Style":"Stout - Russian Imperial","Alcohol":13.00,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev Growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, 2022 vintage  Hooooooo boyyyyy. Parabola. Finally. We don’t see much FW here in Mass, but thankfully a trip to Philly found me at Half Time on the way back, where I ended up with this gem, as well as Perennial Abraxas! I’m so hyped to try this so let’s just get into it  Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut  It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee  A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat  This wasn’t mind blowing by any means, but it is pretty great. I grabbed a bottle from Half Time as well to cellar. Let’s see how this is holding up in 2 years","  rDev It is difficult for me to get as hyperbolic as the average ratings for Parabola. But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.  I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees.","  rDev 2019 vintage. Wonderful aroma of figs, coffee and anise. First sip is intense flavors of bourbon, followed with strong dark chocolate, licorice, and stone fruit. Long lingering finish, you do get a bit of alcohol hotness, but that comes with the territory. A truly world-class beer.","  rDev 12 ounce bottle, 2021 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit/cherry, toffee, chocolate and earthiness. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, caramel, wheat, licorice, burnt/charred malt and rye. There's a lot going on here! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, creamy and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a really good overall brew. Wish I would have bought more of this when I was able to, will definitely buy more the next time I can!","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2021 version, aged in bourbon, rye, and wheated whiskey barrels. It's hard to imagine I've gotten this far in my beer-drinking life and have never yet tasted any Parabola.  Appearance: entirely black with a finger and a half of thick, creamy dark-tan foam atop. Beers like this really have a head-start on looking good, don't they?  Smell: wood, malt, whiskey; maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure. There're notes of dark fruit as well, which you know I always love.  Taste: rich, that's for damn sure. There's dark cherry and raisin and date and prune, of course, but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze. Very, very good indeed. Really, very wonderful.  Mouthfeel: thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth, rich creaminess.  Overall: you never know what you're walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation, whether it's an oldie or something super hyped. This beer is just downright excellent.","  rDev On tap at the brewery. Pours black with beige head. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, sherry, dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, alcohol, herbal hops. Long almost dry finish. Delicious brew.","  rDev 12oz bottle into an odd shaped glass. 2021 release.  Looks outstanding in the glass. Jet black body with an initial generous tan head. This shrinks to a faint ring, leaving scattered lacing.  Aroma of smooth boozy barrel aging with a little chocolate.  On tasting, this beer is triple aged in barrels. Normally the booze element would be overpowering, especially in a recent release.  But here, it is handled superbly. Mellow, smooth dark alcohol, with a hint of chocolate here and there. Dried dark fruit weaves in and out.   Mouth close to full, finish warm sweet booziness.  Overall, just an outstanding beer. Rolls around the tongue beautifully. A must grab every time it shows up.","  rDev 100 score on BA - World Class. I'd think that would be recommended. First try on this, on the eve of another b-day in my 6th decade of life. This is a 2020 consumed in a very hot (record setting) June day 2021. That is one dark beer. No color highlights. Small dark beige head. Deep rich fruit on the nose. Really nice chocolate flavor that is bittersweet. Yummy. The abv is not over-powering in flavor enhancement but it hits quickly. The dark fruit lies in the background a bit, like dark chocolate on berries. Being only a year old it still has some bright sharpness to the malt profile, nonetheless it is very smooth and holds a rich and full mouthfeel.","  rDev 2020 vintage boxed bottle, sampled June 2, 2021.  Appearance: Bonus points for the nice box, beer is black and shows clear ruby edges with strong back light. A short lived tan head dropped off to a thin halo that doesn't lace.  Aroma: Heavy dark malt, bourbon barrel, dark fruit.  Taste: Starts a little sweet, deep malt bill, then a toffee middle goes into an almost sharp bourbon barrel, hop bitter, hot alcohol finish. All of it glorious.  Mouthfeel: Sultry. Silky smooth, low carbonation, medium heavy body, slight chew, a little warm on the finish but fairly clean.  Overall: Wow. It deserves the big numbers. Huge flavor, no flaws (but, it would be hard to tell), alcohol is kept low key and felt more than tasted. Boozy, malty, silky, hints of citric peek through, very complicated but well packaged taste profile. Easy drinking, it's a treat!","  rDev Parabola pours black, with a small, tan head. Aroma is big, huge, whiskey notes, oak, and black licorice. Flavor is sweet, and a little bitter, aggressive, whiskey and oak flavors, warm, hints of smoke and black licorice, a tad of tobacco to finish. Good body and feel. Overall, an increasable, perfectly put together stout.","  rDev Very dark brown body with a small head The smell is lovely with toffee, bourbon barrels with coconut, vanilla, some roasted notes, some nutty notes The tastes follows The mouthfeel is a tad thin but still enjoyable A really good BA Imperial stout, a real sipper","  rDev 2021 vintage. Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. A: Pours a dark brown hue with a one inch tan head with good retention. S: Molasses, dark bitter chocolate, leather, bourbon, wood char, and hints of spicy rye and vanilla. T: Molasses, dark bitter chocolate, leather, wood char, whiskey, bourbon, vanilla, and a hint of fig. M: Medium heavy body. Darkly sweet and bitter. Coating and slightly viscous feel. Lingers nicely on the palate. D: Superbly crafted brew with excellent barrel aging characteristics.","  rDev 650 ml bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV is 12.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head. Intense roasty aroma, notes of dark bitter chocolate, tar, tobacco, leather and coffee. Same elements in the flavour, intensely tarry and rich, salty finish.","  rDev 2017 version thanks to steve k. Roughly 3 yrs old.  L: very dark brown in the sunlight, suspended sediment, minimal dark brn head.  S: Chocolate, licorice, bourbon booziness.  T: chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, bourbon, oakiness. No oxidization.  F: fairly viscous and oily, not super thick.  Overall: solid. Interesting color, fairly boozy but no weird flavors. (Different vintages vary differently. 2018 12 oz bottle. Darker and significantly better).","  rDev Had it from draft at a local World of Beer, served in a snifter. Rich dark brown color with than nice beige head and excellent lacing. Strong dark chocolate and coffee smell and taste. Boozy with warm bourbon feel. Wonderfully smooth, a real treat of a beer.","  rDev Dark jet-black color, has a small creamy brown head. Sweet roasted chocolate, coffee and bourbon aroma, sweet fruity plum-chocolate, bourbon and roasted coffee flavors. Nice burnt bitter-sweet finish. Medium-full body with creamy and smooth, oily mouthfeel, alcohol really shows as it warms, very nice!","  rDev This is a 2014 vintage I finally decided to break open. The results were amazing. Pitch black, heart of darkness level. The dirtiest, yet most beautiful khaki head. Vanilla bean, burnt caramel, spicy gingerbread, tobacco, and nutmeg. While its full bodied and silky smooth the finish remains dry, oaky and uncomplicated with an obnoxiously comforting warmth.","  rDev 2011 bottle.   Pours opaque black with a short-lived head of tan. Dark chocolate, espresso, and light bourbon in the nose. Full bodied with an oily, slick mouthfeel. Charred brownie batter with booze-spritzed coffee beans on the palate. Finishes with rich chocolate, bourbon, and espresso.","  rDev 12oz bottle 2019 vintage (one year old) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at just below room temp 13% ABV 60 IBU 150 SRM. The beer pours impenetrable black with mocha brown head. The head recedes slowly to a cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is oaky bourbon fudge brownie with just a hint of alcohol. The taste is semisweet caramel and chocolate slowly giving way to coffee, char, oak, bourbon and moderate earthy bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a creamy, drying finish with some residual sweetness perfectly offset by the booze &amp; barrel. Overall, outstanding. I've heard this one is hot at first, so I left it in the fridge for a year after the purchase. Maybe the best combo of taste &amp; feel in any BBA stout I've sampled. Just masterful.","  rDev Look - basically black slight head and lacing  Smell - chocolate caramel woody roasty, booze Taste - like the scent, very caramel woody and still booze. Dark fruit. Feel - medium body like carbonation Overall - incredible beer","  rDev Been waiting for this one for a ling time... Two fingers worth of light khaki colored head with excellent retention... Flat black in color... Sweet nose dominated by milk chocolate, dark fruits and light brown sugar... Palate consists of roasted malts, dark chocolate and faint hints of coffee... The rest of the notes from the nose are present but are buried beneath the surface... Uber smooth and silky in texture... Outstanding in all facets and hides the ABV remarkably well...","  rDev 12oz 2019 vintage bottle eased into a snifter shows a dark-as-night, opaque black with just a hint of cola when lit at the edge. A chestnut brown head of mixed bubbles dissipates quickly to a bare body and leaves a clean glass behind after sheets of tiny bubbled lacing races down the glass.  Aromas of caramel, toffee, booze, oak, vanilla, leather, ash, black cherries, and roasted barley make for an enticing mix.  Flavors match and, combined with the velvety smooth mouthfeel, provide a wonderful experience. A tongue-coatingly full feel demands attention and respect, especially given the clean finish and lack of metallic acidity.  This is the closest I have come to a religious experience in a beer. Highest marks at every point along the way.","  rDev Available at Broadway Dive, NYC, in 12oz bottle and for take out. Expectations high considering its highly rated and I’ve yet to have it. At $13.99 + corkage fee, I decided to have this at the bar and split with my friend.  The 6 oz pour yields a jet black color, opaque, viscous and elegant. No head expected, merely a quickly dissipating wisp of light foam.  Complex aromas of roasted malts and barrel aged spirits fill the nose with their fragrant combination. Aromas evoke notes of coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, vanilla, dark fruit, and a touch of smoke. A rich chocolate cake and caramel like malt base also makes way for grassy and minty hops aromas.   Full bodied, gently carbonated and with an ultra smooth mouthfeel. Rich and decadent, yet, somehow balanced and drinkable. Flavors of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, dark caramels, vanilla, oak and cherries, all mouth coating and accentuating the robust and viscous syrupy sweet malts. However, what this drink truly has going for it is the fact that its sweetness is not too cloying while its high alcohol spice is not too boozy. This is achieved through the espresso like bitterness of the roasted malts and the leafy and minty hops flavors. The finish is long with a smooth alcohol warming and slightly medicinal.   I’ve been a little critical of these bug boozy beers as of late, however, this one really does live up to its expectations. As stated above, its balance makes it significantly more drinkable than others of its kind. I’m glad I got to try it.","  12oz bottle, Vintage 2019. It has been 10 years since I've had this one - way too long. Deep mahogany body is capped with a thin tan head. Big, rich, boozy aroma with oaky bourbon, roasted barley, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. On the palate, bold roasted malts and dark chocolate sweetness that lingers with notes of coffee, anise, bourbon, vanilla, oak, char, toasty grain, and bitter earthy hops. Mouth-feel is thick, smooth, and creamy; ample carbonation, alcohol burns the throat; finish is bitter with roast, anise, white pepper, and bitter hops. Just as good as I remember it being! I hope it doesn't take another decade to drink this again!","  rDev fresh 2019 vintage, 12 oz bottle   pours jet black, with thick cream colored head that fades. very rich aroma of dark chocolate, some black cherry, a touch of smoke, caramel, vanilla. taste is similar. you get some of the bourbon barrel, and then the deep roasted malt flavors. thick bodied, very smooth. overall a top notch stout.","  rDev 2018. Pours black with a quarter inch mocha head that settled fairly quickly to a ring and left a couple spots of lacing. Smell is bourbon up front although not overpowering, cocoa, malts, oak, toffee and chocolate. Tastes of sweet bourbon, cocoa, milk chocolate, toffee, oak, vanilla, coffee, molasses, dark fruits and roasted malts. Full bodied, light carbonation, plush and creamy mouth feel. Awesome beer.","  rDev Firestone Walker Parabola, 13% ABV. Pours black with a one-finger tan head that left some lacing. Nose is chocolate, roast malt, and bourbon. Taste follows, plus oak, moderate bitter close. Excellent mouthfeel. Overall outstanding, but a bit heavy on the roast malt and oak for my taste.","  rDev Finally found this beer on tap at the giant eagle in waterworks got it for $7 for a 10 oz pour. Beer is the deepest dark blackness dense oily and thick with a half an inch of frothy head that fades to a very light ring. Smell is simple bittersweet cocoa some Bourbon and wood with a touch of molasses and toffee. Beer is rather sweet dense chocolate and molasses wood vanilla bourbon and finished with a bit of biiter hops. Body is as expected thick dense a real sipper.  Overall a bit too rich for another pour but totally worth trying. A real meal in a glass.","  rDev Pretty far out of my comfort zone price wise, but I'll pony up once for a highly regarded classic. 2019 edition.  Gotta talk about the mouth feel first. It is incredibly full bodied and lush, best I've found in a BA beer. Upper echelon barrel treatment here, no doubt. More luscious, top shelf bourbon than wood or vanilla blotting out what is probably a stellar stout. I certainly don't regret the purchase, maybe even do it again sometime.","  rDev 2019 Edition.  L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a deep, dark, mahogany brown color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a half inch of foamy, tan-colored, somewhat long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.  S: A very enticing aroma of bourbon, malt, chocolate, wood, vanilla, dark fruit, and toffee.  T: Tasted of a bit of toffee, some dark fruit (prunes, raisins), lots of bourbon (and its accompanying oak barrel), a good shot of dark chocolate, some coffee (not a big factor), and a lot of malt (present throughout). For such a big aggressive flavor, this is remarkably well-balanced. Complex and delicious.  F: A decent amount of carbonation with a warm, smooth finish. Medium- to full-bodied.  O: An excellent, well made stout. Drinkable.","  rDev There doesn't appear to be a date code on the bottle or label aside from the  2019  on the front.  Appearance: The beer pours very oily and black with an overall black appearance: The head is short and light khaki. There isn't much head retention or lacing, but there is a bit of a light khaki ring around the edges and a few bubbles.  Aroma: There is a light cocoa scent to the beer, which smells a bit like brownie batter and alcohol. It is appealing but not strong.  Taste: From order from start to finish, the beer tastes like chocolate brownies, to toffee candy, then to a bourbon. There is a lot of dried prune, alcohol, a bit of licorice, and charcoal to the finish of the beer. There is some coffee in the finish. The flavors seem to be present but not balanced. At times it feels like there is too much of a sticky sweetness and at others it feels like I am eating an Arabica dipped coffee cake.  Mouthfeel: The beer is thick, smooth, and oily at all times.  Overall: I wouldn't say this is a beer to go out of your way to find, but if it is stocked on the shelves I would certainly pick it up. While it does tend to check most of the boxes for what you would want in a Russian Imperial Stout, it also seems to cut a few corners. Overall I would recommend it, but depending on the wind, I would favor towards or against it as an average, mostly favoring towards it.","  rDev Requires some months in the bottle to reduce the booziness, but then it's gold. Parabola represents the best of FW’s barrel aging program and is likewise the one first gone from shelves while the others sit around a bit longer.","  rDev 12oz bottle. #10 vintage, 2019 dated. Packaged in an individual beer box. Black colored body, with a very thin garnet back lit highlight. Less than a finger width of tan head, but this stays around as an active bubble fed island and ring. Leaves a few spots of lacing as they continue to slide down the glass. Aroma of dark roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon barrel and vanilla. Taste of dark roasted malts, chocolate, dry raisins, with a touch of vanilla and the bourbon barrel. The higher ABV% expresses with a dry finish and alcohol vapors in the nostrils. Coffee in the after taste, along with coconut as the beer warms. Thicker mouth feel, with an after taste that expresses chocolate malted milk balls. Good carbonation. The chocolate/vanilla mix really stands out, and the bourbon barrel brings the atmosphere. The dark fruit is so soaked with bourbon and wrapped in chocolate. More sweet than bitter, but well balanced throughout. Make this a sipping session so that the beer can reveal itself as it warms.","  rDev 2017 vintage. Pours a dark black, dark brown on the edges when held up to the lighr. Aromas of charred oak and dark chocolate and booziness. Taste follows suit with the charred oak up front with dark bitter chocolate notes and vanilla on the end. Mouthfeel is full and coats the tongue with a thick luscious body. Overall a great beer that just gets better and more flavorful as it warms. Definitely a beer to take your time and enjoy. No need to rush it.

The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond  A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper.

Aroma at first of something like coconut, quickly followed by a vanilla laced light coffee which reminds me of a Kenya bean rather than something more robust from some other part of the World. Very clean and pleasant.  Taste is more coffeeish than coconut with some elements of roasted malt yet it's restrained. Again coconut blends with vanilla but that's just my perception. That all sounds rather sweet but the brew doesn't come across as sweet in the taste as it does in the scent. It finishes clean and dry.  Medium texture with balancing carbonation.

Nice amount of lacing to this this Porter, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts, mixed with coffee an sweetness. The roasted smells are definitely high an in the smell of this brew. So far Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Rich an Bold with flavors.

This is a well put together coffee Porter. If you are a fan of coffee or Porters, you should look this on up. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Roasted, Sweet, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing.

Dessert nose that gives way to some pretty astringent things in the taste which lay awkwardly next to a full body + considerable residual sweetness.

Nice jet black body and fudge colored head. Nose is sweet coffee and vanilla with hops in the background.   Flavor is complex with different stages, all of them balanced and delicious.

Feel: medium to full body","  rDev Dark and very intense but without being boozy this beer delivers what it promises, with nice hints of vanilla and coffee.

My westie cousin, Colby Chandler, is now VP of BP, having started out as the manager of the original Homebrew Mart. I was privileged enough to taste Sculpin in Beta in early-2002, one of the last times that I saw his dad, my Uncle Rick, alive. 8=( My Pops had passed the previous summer &amp; both of them were terribly long-lived, which may not bode well for my longevity. C'est la vie.   From the bottle:  Dedicated to the Craft .   I Pop!ped the cap &amp; went with a (slightly) uncharacteristic aggro pour. My specious reasoning was that it being a dark beer, I might get to see a pseudo-cascade as a result. I am happy to report that my efforts were highly successful! Not only that, but it puffed up with just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention that left behind some nice lacing. Nose was redolent with coffee! Mmm. I love coffee, especially in the morning since old habits die hard as a retired U.S. Navy sailor. Color was Very Dark Brown to Black/Opaque (SRM = &gt; 34, &lt; 44) with mahogany highlights. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but big for an American Porter, certainly. This base version had a solid roastiness, definitely coffee, some smoke &amp; even some chocolate, but I was not getting the vanilla. The vanilla became assertive on the finish, lending the beer a sweetness that it did not initially have. Finish was dry, more roasty than the sweetness could overcome, but it was fine by me. This is the base beer for many variants, so I would encourage you to have this one first &amp; then try some of the others.","  rDev Pours black a small darker tan head, good lace.  Aroma is little light for a big beer, roasted notes, chocolate and vanilla.   Taste is much beer big roasted notes, coffee, chocolate loads of vanilla. Rich big flavors. Good hop bite with lingering coffee bean bitterness and vanilla in the finish. Alcohol notes also in the finish that warms it a little bit they blend perfectly with the flavor.   Mouhfeel and little light for a big beer.  Overall eh nose could be better but flavor is spot on. Pretty easy drinking for a big brew.","  rDev A really nice, no-bullshit coffee stout. Bitter, black, some dark choloclate notes and a subtle vanilla sweetness. Sticky and medium bodied, no head (although I poured it a little too cold). But as it warms the coffee comes oh even more and the vanilla finds it’s place in the back of you tongue and moreso on the nose. Kudos to the sellouts...","  rDev Poured from a single-serve bottle into a tulip  Pours a fine opaque-brown with excellent head and lacing. The aromas of coffee and vanilla are very forward and apparent, but they aren't alone. Smoke, hops, and dark chocolate are there too. The flavor is skewed sweet, but still complex and outstanding. Coffee, vanilla, char, chocolate, hops, and some well-hidden boozy warmth all play on the tongue quite well. The carbonation is good and helps keep this from getting sticky.   One of the best  vanilla  forward brews I've had.","  rDev 12oz bottled 22 days ago poured into a Duvel glass at fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours dense dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is vanilla prominent with coffee in the background. The taste is vanilla forward with the coffee again in the background. There is also a sweet chocolate undertone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and undry (not in an unpleasant way). Overall, very good. I don't know that I've ever had this beer this fresh with the vanilla so dominant. I have 5 more from the pack and may revisit this review.","  rDev From a growler via Jungle Jim's Eastgate in a snifter. This mighty fine  porter  (pert near a stout) pours a rich muddy blackish brown with a fantastic head of light tan foam that has excellent staying power that finally fades to a thick layer with exceptional lacing. Nose of rich coffee, cocoa, vanilla, spicy hops, char, and earthy malts. Flavors hit the perfect note with vanilla bean dancing about a moderately heavy char flavor on bakers cocoa and caramel malts that drift on waves of vanilla and rich coffee with a spicy pine tinged hop finish. Very nice  mouth feel; medium light carbonation that is lively for the style, full body,  coating, and finishing with a char laden finish.   A stout lovers porter for certain, this one is sure to please those who like their  porters on the Baltic side of life with nicely hidden alcohol. Excellent. One of the  best I have ever had from Ballast Point.

Aroma with the expected predominant notes of cold brew coffee and vanilla beans. Hints of caramel, cocoa, mild lactic acid, a bit of caramel, nuts and dark fruits. Flavor with notes of vanilla upfront, caramel, green coffee beans, some spices, lactic acid, roasted malts (even though the sensation comes more from coffee), licorice, piney and floral hops, dark chocolate and cream. Dry and bitter aftertaste with a lingering roasted note with pine and vanilla in the background. Bordering full body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 10% abv is very well hidden. At a first sip, I noticed it was going to be relatively more complex for the style, although it brings upfront both cold brew coffee and lots of vanilla. This Imperial Porter is almost a RIS. I was in doubt if this was brewed with lager yeast as its Baltic peers or with ale yeast at controlled temperatures, given its purer yeast profile. This has matured well after a couple of years since I bought this.","  Poured from a 12oz bottle. Bottling date looks to be March of 2016. Very dark, but red hues comes through against the light. Tan, bubbly, frothy head, good lacing Coffee and malt on the nose, coffee and vanilla combine for taste, with vanilla lasting longer. Very, very tasty.

Left Hand Milk Stout  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle $2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: It's been a long time since I've had a Left Hand Milk Stout as I usually come across the nitro version these days. And there was a time once, long ago, that I thought the nitro version was better but I've changed my mind and now I think I like the original better. It's an opaque brown-black in color beneath a creamy head of dark tan. It's not that carbonated so the head falls rather easily but it does leave some nice lacing behind. The aroma is clean and fresh, and like dark bittersweet chocolate with some coffee like roastiness. The flavor follows with some added sweet-apple-like fruitiness, dark caramel, and nuttiness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and velvety smooth once the initial caress of carbonation has passed. It's moderately bitter, but roasty, and although there's some residual sweetish malt it doesn't finish sweeter than semi-dry with lingering notes of chocolate and creamy coffee. It's very nicely balanced and rounded, and as far as milk stouts go it's right on for style.","  rDev On nitro tap!","  rDev Exceptional beer. Recommend.","  rDev Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a one inch tan head that left some lacing. Smells and tastes of roasted malts, milk chocolate, coffee, vanilla and caramel. Lactose sweetness is very evident in the flavor. Medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy mouth feel.","  rDev L: Pours out a very dark brown, almost black. Looks pith black in the glass, with a thin foamy head of tan. Retention is minimal, but there's spotty beige lacing left.  S: Oats, roasted barley, dark and milk chocolates, dark coffee with vanilla cream, caramel, burnt toast.  T: Lots of dark and milk chocolate, along with the bready, grainy oat character. Some roasted and burnt coffee, grain, and toasted flavors, but kept in check by a subtle creamy sweetness of vanilla, almond milk, and caramel. Finishes very well balanced between chocolate and vanilla sweetness, and coffee, cacao, and burnt toast bitterness.  F: Medium-plus bodied; could almost be considered full bodied. Smooth, rich, and creamy. It's like carbonated chocolate milk.  O: The definitive American milk stout? This is delicious stuff. Perfectly balanced chocolate and coffee flavors with subtle vanilla and milky sweetness. Creamy and delicious.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is pitch black with a medium sized tan head. The aroma is sweet malt. The taste matches the nose and has a nice amount of coffee added to it.","  rDev A legend. This awesome milk stout pours a deep blackish brown with a nice head of light tan foam that settles to a thin ring, thin layer, and spotty lacing. Nose of  chocolate, roasted coffee, cream, and subtle char notes. Flavors lightly exceed the  nose with cream, coffee, and dark chocolate mingling nicely on all sides and finishing  on the rear with cream and coffee. Solid mouth feel, medium carbonation, full on the taste, coating, and finishing with a touch of char and bitter malt. Excellent.  Cheers","  rDev Left Hand Brewing - I have yet to partake of one of their offerings to disappoint, and Milk Stout is no exception.  A beautiful dark stout, it does have a weak head with no staying power and much to do about nothing when it comes to lacing. However, the aroma is almost perfection - distinct hints of chocolate and roasted malts, the same can easily be distinguished when it comes to its taste. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent at first, is certainly carbonated out of the bottle, but it eases back as the brew sits. I think I've had some better ones from LH and but this one is certainly one of the better milk stouts in its class.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours a beautiful amber black with a super thick tan head. Smells of coffee and vanilla, bit of French vanilla. Taste is similar, extremely creamy, and very smooth.","  rDev Left Hand Milk Stout, 6% ABV, 25 IBU. Pours thick, opaque, no head, coffee smell. Coffee taste, coffee bitter finish, some sweetness. Not bad, would get again.","  rDev OK. I get it. Milk lactose makes this style sweet; Left Hand makes the style's most popular; and I'm liking it. The logic is overwhelming: I'm a sweet guy ! (Funny how beer can bring transcendence to situation in which little else makes sense.)  Looking this milk stout in the eye, it has not much to say for itself. Smelling it says toasted chocolate malts and  I won't surprise you.  Tasting this milk stout says my nose was correct. Feeling it says I've taken this  -ing  too far... but I like how heavily toasted malt keeps the sweet in check. My original notes said  have this next time with dessert.   I did so with an assortment of cookies and a bowl of vanilla ice cream. (Proving again my good judgment.)  Listed in the  1001 Beers To Drink Before You Die,  Left Hand's rendition deserves to be there because its BA ratings has an insurmountable lead and because it led American brewers to save this British style (essentially lost by the 1920s.)","  rDev Undated bottle into pint glass. Pours a virtually opaque black with a thin off-white head. Initial impression is, interestingly, kinda flavorless and thin. (In all fairness, I'd just tried a Dieu du Ciel Solstice D'hiver barleywine so perhaps ANYTHING would seem thin and flavorless by comparison. Maybe  subtle  is the proper descriptor.) There are definitely roasted malts and a milky sweet caramel/cocoa undertone. Mouthfeel is medium (I prefer thicker) and carbonation is medium (I prefer less). Finish is very neutral, in keeping with the rest of the experience.  Not bad, but certainly not exceptional. I had this on nitro and that was also underwhelming.

That needs to be changed! No, this isn't going to win any awards and it's not the first American Amber / Red Lager that I'd reach for but let's face it - this is a classic and holds a special place in American brewing history. Those in Pennsylvania expect to get this when they order a  lager  in a bar but the rest of us know that this is just a classic that hasn't changed in decades, in spite of changing tastes...  This came in a green bottle and generally, I distrust brews that are packaged that way but this was still better than it's European macro counterparts. Clear, ruddy brown, and topped off with enough head, this had a nice appearance as this was this beer's best aspect by a mile. Very few soapy spots were left behind on the side of my pint glass as the thinness of the liquid became quite apparent. Loads of green apple, pear, bread, sweet malt, and caramel on the nose as the taste contained all of those as well. Light, balanced, and nicely carbonated, this went down so easily, but not completely mindlessly. Grass emerged in the aftertaste as this went down surprisingly easily without leaving much of an impression or aftertaste, aside from some break and bubbly effervescence on the palate...  Booze? Oh, it's here somewhere but I didn't find it - not even at the bottom of my glass. As a reviewer below stated, this beer calls for...another Yuengling and if there was ever anything that should come in six-packs, this would be it. Not the first beer I'd reach for but the cloying mouthfeel, smooth flavor profile and easy drinkability of this ensured that it would always hold a special place in my heart. Like any classic, this deserves to live forever - one session at a time.","  rDev Haven’t had this beer in a while (at least 10 years) but finally found it in a store. Still tasty. Pours a darker amber color with lots of fluffy white head and some spotty lingering lacing. Smells of malt, caramel, roasted nuttiness, toast and some mild grain. Taste follows the nose.

The aromas are classic toasted amber lager. Nice biscuit toasted  smells  with caramel malts present.  The flavor is somewhat neutral and  safe,  but has a pleasing sweet, toasty smoothness.

Overall: Union Jack has been a favorite for a while but I finally got around to reviewing since it is usually unrefrigerated and old around here. Nice old school IPA with solid bitterness and a good malt base.","  rDev Poured into a Nonic.   Pours a slightly chill-hazed medium gold with a decent head and excellent lacing.  Quite a range of aromas. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, caramel malts meet floral, grassy, and piney aromas.   Definitely West Coast, yet still rather well balanced, thanks to a proper start. Caramel malt and honey-kissed graham cracker on the tip of the tongue quickly gives way to grapefruit bitterness, which evolves quickly into a resin-fest in the mid palate, before that surrenders to a more delicate, restrained floral/grassy bitterness at the finish that hints at the deceptive bitterness that comes from a wild clover honey.   Medium bodied, but well carbonated. Has a nice, relatively short and drying finish.   Firestone Walker is not available in the Dakotas, so glad to have grabbed some of this one while in Illinois. This is a badass WCIPA.","  rDev 12oz can. Clear amber colour with a thin, short-lived head. Rich, slightly smoky, caramelised orange aroma. Intense marmalade, overripe citrus and resin flavours. Very solid bitterness. Thick and oily mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. A classic old skool West Coast IPA. Lovely.","  rDev Let's begin with two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug. The color is a bright copper-amber and fairly translucent. A modest head quickly disappears. There's a good hop presence for the nose, mostly piney and maybe a bit bitter. The balance between malt. hops, yeast and alcohol is very good. The malt is rich, but not overly sweet. Piney and resinous are the hops, then they leave with a clean bitter bite. Just the right amount of carbonation works well with the malt to provide a good mouthfeel. Amazingly rich and tasty for a brew with no glass lacing and minimal head. This is an AIPA deserving of the  classic  label.","  rDev Our go-to IPA. Crisp and clean. No haze, no murk, just good looking beer. Nose is light tropical friuts and background yeastiness. Superb balance, no flaws, clean finish. It doesn't get much better than this. Widely available and reasonably priced.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.0%. Nearly clear golden colour, moderate white head. Strong aroma of piney and grapefruity hops, a hint of caramel. Smooth mouthfeel. The flavour is heavily hopped, but not overdone. Notes of pine needles, resin, grapefruit and bitter Seville oranges. Sufficient malts to balance.","  rDev (from 2018):  Well, here's a beer I'm trying for the first time, it seems. Something tells me I must have tried it at least once, somewhere, some when. And sure enough, I have, at a tasting once. But here is my first time with a can to myself, ready to take notes.  Clear, bright golden, slimm-ish, chalk white head, leaving a little lace.  In the nose: floral, citrus-y, delightful and lovely. So very nice.  In the mouth: Bitterness and juicy hop flavor blasts the palate first. Starts slightly fruity and sweet, then turns dry. Light bodied, and deliciously drinkable. Bright, crisp, beautiful. Fresh, hoppy, tasty, yes. This is exactly how I want an IPA to be.","  rDev This beer has a little age on it, but not too bad, so it should still be good for reviewing (canned on June 3, reviewed on Aug 9). I removed it from a ~40° F 'fridge and allowed to stand for a nearly 10 minutes before opening (longer than I intended; I was distracted after removing it from the refrigerator).  Strong aroma evident as soon as I cracked the can. Pine, grapefruit, pineapple. Just detectable is bread.  Clear golden yellow, moderate carbonation, topped by a tall off-white bubbly / creamy head that recedes in 2 or 3 minutes to floating islands and a thick ring. Some spotty lacing. I knocked the  look  rating down .25 due to the quickly disappearing head. Otherwise, a good-looking beer.  Initial taste is pine and grapefruit, strongly accented by a bitterness in the middle that carries through to the finish. There is a semi-sweet malt body trying to stay relevant, eventually pushed back by the hops flavors and bitterness. The aftertaste is pine and bitter, but does not grow quite as much as Stone IPA (for example) as you drink, but it does grow enough to maintain it's credentials as West Coast style. So, this beer presents itself as not palate-wrecking bitter, but inviting-the-next-sip bitter.  The body is moderate for the style, with a bitter edge.  Overall, a very good IPA in the West Coast style.","  rDev Pours a completely clear copper-golden color. Thick pillowy white head dissipates until there is just a thin ring of foam along the outside of the glass.   Aroma has notes of pine, herbal hops, ripe orange and orange marmalade, and a touch of dried grass.   Taste follows the nose with a mild notes of pine, dried grass, orange rind, and a touch of sap. While the hoppy bitterness is potent, the overall flavors are really mild and balanced. That results in a pretty easy drinking WCIPA.   The feel plays right along with that - Its pretty light, slick and easy drinking. The bitterness produces a dry finish on the back end.   Overall this was a really nice IPA - This is the kind of beer I'd happily order with dinner at a restaurant and enjoy.","  rDev 12 oz can with an August 2019 canning date stamp on the bottom. Pours with an amber colored body with a good white head.  Excellent mouthfeel from a medium body with lively but soft carbonation.  Medium strength and bitterness for style.","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed Summer 2012.","  rDev In the age of the haze craze, there is nothing like trying a well respected West Coast IPA for the first time. Great citrus and pine flavors, very crisp, very dry, fairly bitter, and extremely refreshing.","  rDev Served from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle at The Tap House in Tuckahoe, NY, into a 12 oz schooner glass.  A: Pours a cloudy, amber color with no more than half finger, white head formation with rim retention, but rings of foamy lacing.  S: Aromas of caramel, orange, and light pine mix.  T: More Semisweet than semidry. Palate flavors largely favor the nose with a subtle orange. Slightly peppery bitterness is light with a clean, refreshing finish.  M: Light to medium bodied with strong persistent carbonation. O: Really enjoyable. Really a mid-Atlantic IPA.","  rDev 12 oz bottle pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of tight bubbles, leaves good lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and pine aromas, hoppy citrus and pine flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry. This is very drinkable for the 7 % alcohol, very nice!","  rDev Canned 2/3/15; drank 2/22/15 @ the Yarchives.   See-through orange appearance; a few champagne bubbles throughout.   Big off-white head; frothy, tree-rung lace.   Orange citrus nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Mango &amp; caramel flavors up front; mild grapefruit bite on the finish.   A nice IPA.","  rDev Clear, deep gold. white head, great retention and lace Floral, grapefruit and orange hops, sweet malt underneath Tastes like it smells, delicious Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation, clean, crisp A standard bearer","  rDev Not getting much aroma from this, just a bit of pineapple perhaps? Pours a clear golden amber color with a modest head. Taste is slightly sweet initially followed by a pleasant hop bite. Tropical flavors are subdued, just a classic take on a west coast IPA. Quite enjoyable.","  rDev Pours orange-gold from a 12-oz can. Half a finger of head. Malt-forward, with some fruity accents of tangerine, peach, and orange gumdrop. Not exactly what I think of as a West coast IPA, or as  aggressively hopped,  but a very solid IPA for a cheaper price point.","  rDev On tap at The Knickerbocker in Altoona PA tonight.  Slightly hazy orange/amber body with a small white head which diminishes to a ring and covering, leaving some lacing.  Hoppy citrusy aroma.  Good tasting brew. Malt background is strong and supportive, citrus notes of orange and grapefruit are not overdone. Good balance here. Bitterness level is just right for this palate.  Mouth above medium, finish bittersweet.  Overall, a good solid American IPA. Not sure about the name, which implies an English IPA, but that's a very minor gripe.","  rDev Very surprised I have never reviewed this... 12 oz. Can. 1/31/19 Opened on 5/3/19  Kind of a nice  change of pace  from the onslaught of Hazy New England Style IPA's . (Which I love) but why not throw in a classic West Coast, English style IPA to mix it up a bit?   Pretty much a clear and sparkling copper color with some gold shimmer. Robust, off-white colored foam head, pretty dense with slow dissipation. Constant coverage with a thin layer and chunky lace...looks good.   The aromatics for me is dominated by the blend of caramel and bready malt notes and sharp, tropical fruits like, pineapple, grapefruit and orange rind. Honey sweetness, tangy and floral hop aroma's make for a classic IPA from the left coast.  First sip= sharp and dry! Crispy malt, dry and earthy bitterness, pine sap and malty grains. Then comes some big fruity sweetness and lush hop complexity.The English-esque malty complexity (both amber sweet and hearty grains) literally provides the perfect balance and charm for the style. The hops are equal to the task: pineapple, dry grasses, peppery and tangy fruits makes it a heady complexity overall.   After almost 7,000 reviews with a BA score of 4.23...proves this is one of the finest versions of the style.","  rDev 12oz canned 2-21-19 (opened 4-13-19) Deep golden - clean and clear. 3/4  white head with decent retention, settles in at a solid, creamy cap. Leaves some wispy lace to begin and almost a full sheet on the back side on the way down. Caramel malt, bready slightly sweet nose. Citrus and pine, smell pretty WC but has a little extra malt ooomph. Malty IPA, grapefruit, light pine - big malty, crystal base with some caramel notes and bread/dough. Medium to full body, medium-low carbonation. Feels like can conditioned with a full mouthfeel, maybe - maybe not. Really good, it's been a minute since I had this, nice refresh for me in the FW Mixed 12pk. WC IPA but there's a twist here with more malt complexity and a very appealing mouthfeel.","  rDev Served on tap in a shaker pint. Clear and orange yellow, with a finger of foam. Nice aromas of pine and tangerine. Flavor is smooth, lots of pineapple juice balanced against pine and grapefruit pith. Not exceptionally bitter, more smooth on the the finish than anything. Some mandarin notes.","  rDev canned, to think the idea ten years ago of me drinking an American canned beer, then came the crafry craft cans fairly clear golden body with decent white head aroma is grapefruit and golden syrup oh I love the bitter, I see how the West coast reinvented the IPA based on UK bitter Bitters","  rDev 12oz canned 12/18/18 (46 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey colored amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin film and ring leaving a few spots of lacing. The aroma is faint with pine and citrus. The taste is subtle caramel up front with big bitterness coming on quick. More vague citrus and pine are interwoven the final third of the taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is a little residual sugar and hop oil stickiness, but the sum of the parts is enjoyable. Overall, very good classic West Coast IPA.","  rDev Pours copper with a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is orange and clementine, pine, dank, resin and syrup. Toasty biscuits, and light earthy malts round out the aroma. Hops really jump out, and hit old-school, classic notes in a beautiful way. Flavor profile is dank, resin, fir and orange citrus hops with biscuity, earthy malts behind. It carries a light bitterness and bite, but is just enough to add a little bark, not bite, to the flavor profile. Mouth feel is crisp, with a light effervescence across the tongue. It has a medium thickness. Overall, an old school, classic IPA hitting evergreen forest hop notes mixed and mingled with California resin-y. It features a light bite, but an overall soothing taste.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz can.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a clear golden amber with a nice off-white long lasting head, it leaves a good bit of lace as you enjoy the beer. Very pleasant, hoppy scent. Very pleasant, enjoyable hoppy taste. Yum!","  rDev Union Jack IPA pours a copper color, with a small, long lasting and slightly lacing head. Rich crisp aroma. Flavor is hoppy, but very dry, with great floral notes. Great body and feel, very dry. Overall, fanatic IPA, very dry.","  rDev On cask at PreFunk. Cask smooths out the bitterness, rich golden color, lots of sticky lacing. Velvety consistency. Nice west coast IPA, although a bit on the lighter side.","  rDev This beer pours a nice golden color with s 2 finger white head. The retention is average, and there's a bit of lacing on the glass as the head leaves.  The nose is quite nice in the hops department. Quite citrusy. Grapefruit, pineapple.  Taste - is an IPA. The hops really dominate with the citrus more up front and the pine taste on the backside.  Feel - Decent bodied, and the hops do linger in my throat.  Yes, this is a decent IPA."]},{"Name":"Oatmeal Stout","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/113/571/","Brewery":"Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster)","Style":"Stout - Oatmeal","Alcohol":5.00,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse.

The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.","  rDev 16oz bottle, into a pint glass. From May 8th 2021.  Looks the part, very dark brown body, small tan head, scattered lacing.  slightly roasted caramel malt.  On tasting, smooth, but still enough of a roast for balance. A little coffee.

Undertones of coffee, caramel, wet ash and a hint of licorice  T- roasted barely and chocolate up front, along with a hint of char that gives a coffee note.

Near white head forms nicely on a pour and drops quickly to a collar with some lacing.  Expected coffee and dark chocolate seem to hide a bit behind a more cola nose. Note sure if the oatmeal is affecting this, especially at the edges, which have a root to nutty note. Weak coffee opening on a cold brew, but its a fleeting impression. Light with moderate leaning light carbonation, it cleans up fairly dry with a little roasted malt linger. Flavors of roasted malt, medium rich coffee, and a little cola in the back give an overall nice stout profile. There's a little brown sugar sweetness up front as it warms, but it doesn't permeate the rest of the profile.","  rDev Bottled   I always love a good oatmeal stout, and this seems to be one of the classics of the style. I’m surprised that I’ve never had it, so I grabbed it along with some of their other stouts and porters to see what all the rage is about  Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of fluffy tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves spotty lacing  The aroma here is quite sweet, but refreshing in a way for a stout in the sense that it’s not weighed down by any bullshit. I’m getting aromas of dark roasted malt, light roast coffee, a pear-like fruitiness, and a touch of bittering hops  The taste loses a bit in translation from the aroma, but it’s still great. Up front I’m tasting milk chocolate, dark malt, caramel, and a touch of coffee. The swallow brings more of the fruity sweetness with notes of pear, nutty milk chocolate, smooth oatmeal, and light grassy hops  A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation to create a very smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry but coats the mouth  A delicious beer, super flavorful without being heavy and refreshing for a stout. I’ll definitely be getting this again","  rDev Deep and dark body, revealed to be a clear brown with a back-light, below a tall tan head, thick and creamy, from a vigorous pour into an Imperial tulip pint glass. The head develops a pitted and rocky surface as it recedes, leaving some strings of lacing behind. As the beer is consumed, the glass has sheets and strings of tan lacing from the top to the surface of the beer.  Aroma is roasted chocolate and figs. Some hints of coffee, but that is just the familiarity of the roasted smells.  The taste starts with the welcome flavors of English brewing, the minerals from the water and the flavor of the English hops and roasted malts, giving flavors of chocolate and dark fruits (figs and raisins). Smooth flavor and smooth body, with just a bit of bitterness, as from roasted coffee. The finish is sweetish, and yet dry.  The body is moderate to thin, as befits the English stout tradition.  Overall, excellent to sip by the fire on a near-winter evening here in the upper Midwest. I'm almost sitting in an English pub in my mind.","  rDev Poured from a 550-ml bottle into a Samuel Smith nonic pint glass. Deep, almost lightproof brown colored body, topped by a thick head of light tan. Lots of sticky lacing as the head receded. Now, it may be the power of suggestion, but I'd almost swear I can taste and smell the mineral notes imparted by the Yorkshire squares. Beyond that, this is a nicely-balanced and extremely satisfying pint. There's nothing here to slap you in the face. Pleasant mouthfeel, just the right amount of bitterness, clean finish. I could drink this all day long, and that is a compliment.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a clear dark brown/black with a light tan head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing. A bit of lace as you enjoy the brew. Scent is mostly roasted malt. In the mouth, roasted malts and maybe some raisins.

Taste is roasted pecans, a touch of semi-sweet chocolate, the earthiness of root vegetables (minus any specific vegetable) , and a bit of wood. Light pleasant bitterness.   Feel : I've had this numerous times, though not recently, so had to double-check to remind myself of what the abv is. ( :O- 5%!) The feel is lighter than what the aroma and taste might lead one to expect, but surprisingly substantial for 5% abv. Moderate, very fine carbonation .

The empty 550ml bottle bottle weighs 410Gms so full it's nigh on a Kilo and it feels it, reassuringly and unusually hefty. L- Black, with a 3mm fine-bubble mid-tan head.

T- Follows the Smell^, toast, log-ashes, charred wood, hints of smoke, surprisingly complex; especially with it being built up upon a foundation of 'a mere' 5% ABV. F- It's quite meaty for 5.0%, it comes over as more 6.0-6.2% to me. I'm not historically a fan of stout/porter etc but this is an example of how it should be done. I'd happily drink this again. Anyone still blinkered enough to be a fan of factory Guinness should be encouraged to try a stout like this and have 'the scales lifted from upon their eyes' Ie what a REAL trad stout could and should be.

The smell was light on malt but it has a caramel background to it and it also has a distinctive bready tang to the nose, with a mouthfeel that was watery, no denying it.

The beer is 46 degrees and served in a pint glass. The pour created a massive three-fingered light tan head. The head is creamy and foamy with excellent retention. The slow dissipation left gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 8, amber yellow with a light mahogany tint. The clarity of the beer is perfect with a few carbonation bubbles popping up and floating to the surface. An elegant representation of a pale ale.  The initial aromas in the beer are pine, grapefruit, and resin. Nosing further, I detect caramel, floral esters, oranges, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, and a subtle dankness.   The flavors in the beer are caramel, toasted malts, bay leaves, dewy mornings, floral esters, biscuit, oranges, a hint of herbal, leather, pine, grapefruit, and resin.   The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic and astringent.   The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and full finish.   Absolutely an amazing pale ale. The malty backbone holds the hops too well. I think this beer is eclipsing on an IPA. I would drink this beer regularly if I could get it. Something I did not like is the heavy-handed malt profile.","  rDev 12 oz bottle, bottled 3/9/21  Pours dark orange copper in color, slightly cloudy, cream colored head. Good head retention.

Pours a reddish-gold hue with a huge frothy head into my glass. Sweet and doughy in the nose with some citrus hidden behind it. Nice and bitter upfront and this time, it reminds me more of pine than citrus. Drinks like an old school pale ale without any of the gimmicks that usually mar today's pale ales. Quaffable and finishes clean. Well worth the rating.","  rDev Old school. Smells of pine and orange and peach. Taste follows the nose. Caramel. Slick. Low carbonation but pine and peach dominate. Silky. A little bit sticky. Wont revisit but glad to finally try.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Pours deep orange red with a fluffy white head. Smells of citrus and some fruit, tropical notes. Tastes of tropical fruit and citrus, with nice grain notes. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, from Ølbutikken, Copenhagen. ABV is not mentioned on the label. Cloudy orange-brown colour, large off-white head. Lovely aroma of American hops, notes of citrus and tropical fruits, hints of pine forest. The hoppy flavour has notes of pine and grapefruit, and is fairly dry. Bitter aftertaste. Quite good.","  rDev Similar to Zombie Dust, this APA seems to me (not alone) as an IPA. This comes to me as more bitter, especially in a piney sense, than ZD. It’s a darker beer with a more interesting malt profile, closer to many PNW IPAs I’ve had.  For that reason (determined in a side-by-side comparison), I find this more IPA than the ZD that toes the line evocatively. Being more out of balance has my scores couched in style, but I really do quite enjoy this beer as a toasty malt, pine with some grapefruit pith solid IPA.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  PKGD ON 02/17/21 Q0274   Appearance: The body is slightly hazy and a dark bronze color. It is much darker than the standard pale ale. The head is very large, wite-tan colored, and creamy textured across the surface. It leaves creamy webs of lacing on the glass. It has excellent retention and lacing.  Aroma: It has a light lemon aroma. The aroma comes in more when moving the glass under the nose but there isn't a lot of aroma while hovering directly over the glass. A light bit of pine comes through when deeply inhaling.  Taste: Up front there is a lime flavor with a hint of pine. Towards the middle of the mouth that lime comes through even stronger with the addition of light mint character. It finishes with a refreshing pine and lime character.  Mouthfeel: It has a nice refreshing character with a light body. Bitterness is very good. It's very easy to drink and it's enjoyable. The finish is somewhat wet with a light raspy finish.  Overall: It doesn't push out a lot of aroma but the beer is refreshing and has a nice mixture of lime, a little lemon and mint, and pine. It would go well with some grilled fish and a salad or a lightly seasoned grilled chicken. I could drink it again, especially given that it was in a can. The mixture of citrus and pine would make this a good beer to bring to the beach or the woods. I'd buy it again and I'd recommend it.","  rDev From a 12 fl. oz. can sampledf on Feb 27. 2021.  Very attractive looking copper-amber pour underneath a moderate off-white head. Lacing.  Aroma of breaded malts, floral esters, and a cleanliness.  Medium mouthfeel.  The taste is at first sweet and then bitter, This epitomizes a balanced pale ale. Right on!.","  rDev Pours a deep golden color with light brown hues. Nice fluffy egg shell colored head that slowly dissipated into a thick ring. Looks like a beer.  The aroma is of juicy grapefruit hops. Fresh and slightly peppery.  The taste is more savory. Some onion and herbal hop notes. Pepper. The malt base is of brown bread and honey.  The feel is moderate on the palate. Soft carbonation. Good balance. Nice transition between sweet and bitter.  A very nice pale ale. Significant body and good balance. Prefer a more fresh hop flavor.","  rDev Canned 10/6/20  Now we're finally getting back around to 3 Floyds reviews. I've been drinking a steady supply of Zombie Dust since they started distro in Mass, but now it's time to review a new one. This is likely a step down from ZD, but I'm sure it'll be good  Pours a hazy red copper with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves tons of lacing. Really dark for an APA but it looks awesome, as does the can art  The nose presents a nice balance, I get lots of citrusy hops, lightly spicy yeast, crisp bread, and caramel malt, offering up more subtle notes of orange and honey  This might as well just be an IPA. A very balanced one, but still. The front end of the sip is loaded with prickly piney hops and some pale malt and orange to balance it out. The swallow increases the malt and turns sweet, offering more of a honey note, along with toasted bread, pepper, and general citrus  This has a medium body and almost no carbonation, but still goes down very easy. The abv feels about right, and this finishes in the middle of dry and sticky, coats the mouth  This was really good, almost as good as Zombie Dust. I'll continue to try the new offerings I see from these guys, they do great work","  rDev Served from tap into a 16 oz (473 ml) conical pint glass at Growlers Beer Bistro in Tuckahoe, NY.  A: Pours a cloudy, copper color with a one to finger, white head, cap retention and hanging curtains of lacing.  S: Very subtle lemon citrus and pine overlay with caramel maltiness.  T: More semisweet than semidry. Elements of palate follow nose, but caramel malt backbone predominates. Bitterness nicely subdued, but contributes to complexity and crisp finish.  M: Light to medium bodied. Solid carbonation and smooth drinking. O: On a par with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Wonderful complement to food.","  rDev This is my first experience with Alpha King, hot off the heels of my first can of Zombie Dust last night, and I'm pretty excited to give it a shot. This beer is a strong APA (one might call it an  Extra Pale Ale  if one is so inclined) featuring Centennial, Cascade, and Warrior hops, and I am close to the two-thousandth person to write a review for it, so I'll just dispense with the introductions and get right into the write-up.  The pour here is a hazy dark-ish amber (for an APA, anyway) with a huge head of slightly-off-white foam that leaves behind some superb lace and great legs. Excellent surface coverage, which, when combined with the semi-hazy body, gives off this  intense  appearance that strikes a chord with me. It doesn't much like many APAs I've ever had, but I think I appreciate that.  The nose here is pretty damn aggressive with some candied grapefruit, strong pine resin, and spicy notes all vying for attention alongside a deep maltiness that feels like it'll come across very balanced. I pick up a slight hit of ethanol, too, and I think I enjoy that this doesn't seem super dry-hopped or  juicy  or anything. It's just coming across to me as an immediately-satisfying,  extra  hoppy ale. Some spruce, caramel, biscuity malts, and light hints of mango/pineapple tropicalness.  First sip is strong maltiness backed up by a wash of resinous hops lingering like a sticky veneer on the palate, bringing out some surprising flavors of overripe mango to match the citrusy bent of the Cascade. Light floral flavors and a bit of subtle spice layer in as the beer opens up, and this complexity really starts to get nice once this exits fridge temperatures and gets closer to room temp. Like a lot of  darker  hoppy pales (looking at you, Furious and Nugget Nectar), this one exists in a weird space between  hoppy  and  malty  as we currently think of them with regards to American ales. It's like a miniature barleywine in a lot of ways, I guess, and that brings with it some interesting implications. Would this be  better  with some more dry-hopping, maybe with some  newer  hop varietals? What about tweaking the recipe so there's less dark-leaning malt? Who knows? I think I like this more than Zombie Dust, though, even though they're completely different beers in the  same style.  Yikes. Anyway, the feel here is nice and slick, comfortingly warming and rather soft, all things considered. The carbonation isn't aggressive, the hop combo feels nice and balanced, and everything about it seems high quality to me. Maybe a bit underrated here, or maybe I just prefer this kinda thing.","  rDev From the can, it pours a somewhat clear amber color. A large foam head retains well. Nice look, however, it looks more like an amber ale rather than pale ale.  Lots of sweetness in the nose, including notes of caramel, toffee, toasted and biscuity malt. Yet, the hops soon make their presence felt with aromas of pine and citrus fruit.  Opens sweet with soft and chewy malt flavors. Notes of caramel, biscuit and toasted malt. As with the nose, the hops flavors emerge. There are bright notes of grapefruit rind and orange, as well as a generous amount of pine resin. The bitterness increases, yet, the balance is held firmly in check. The finish is malty and dry with a long lingering resiny bitterness.   Medium bodied with a moderate to gentle carbonation. The mouthfeel is very smooth.  Very well balanced and easy to drink. Stylistically it seems to straddle the lines between a balanced IPA, a hoppy pale ale, with amber ale colors. Regardless, it’s really good.","  rDev Poured from can dated 10/5 into a can glass Aggressive pour results in a fluffy off white head and a deep amber color aroma is sweet and citrus and slightly earthy Taste is caramel sweet and citrus rind tart, nice combo. There is a slight lingering earthy ness  There is a lot happening with mouthfeel. Medium carbonation, sticky, chewy and a lingering astringent citrus that goes from the roof of your mouth to a tingle on the tongue  Overall it’s a well balanced beer, one thing doesn’t over shadow another, it’s well layered","  rDev A: Pours a reddish bronze color with 2 fingers of head that slowly fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing  S: Pine and citrus up front along with some caramel and earthy undertones  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of pine, citrus, and caramel and then picks up the earthy undertones. Moderate bitterness throughout. Finishes with lingering pine and caramel  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. On the stickier side  O: A good pale ale that is definitely on the hoppy side but super well balanced. Very easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out","  A: Deep amber/bronze pour. Perfectly clear. Off-white head, even lines of lace.   S: A little bold on the caramel malt. That sweetness plays with sweet tang of tangerine, mandarin, starfruit, buddha's hand.  M: Moderate creaminess, med-body, crisp carbonation.  T/O: A well done WC IPA. No cloying sweetness from the malt, or off flavors from the interaction with the hops. Tastes like a very good marmalade and some rosemary herb toast. Peppery, pine, dry grapefruit peel finish.   Been waiting a long time to try 3F beers. Living in an area saturated with brewers making IPAs, I find that when they do venture into the non-hazy world their attempts are often miscalculated, and the product is never as clean tasting as this. Can I say this is way different than a two-hearted ale or a Fat Heads, probs not, but it's just as good.","  rDev 2d review of 3 Floyds, 1st of this classic, in my fave APA style.

Poured with a tall, rocky, light tan foam foam that left ample sticky lacings on the glass. A balanced truism of herbal, spicy and citruusy aromas with sweet caramel malt notes beneath. Medium bodied with soft, medium carbonation. Creamy, slightly chewy feel with the lazy carbonation followed by mellow warmth to the end. Over-ripe rich citrus flavors with earthy herbal notes. Medium hop bitterness through the middle followed by more herbal flavors along with solid malt and dark caramel notes. Finished with a bitter pine hop burst followed by lingering citrus and pine. Malty characters perfectly balanced the plethora of hop flavors and aromas. Great feel and pleasantly bitter finish. Glad this finally made it's way to PA. Fantastic.","  rDev Pours a dark copper with fluffy head.  Smell is piney with notes of pine, resin, caramel and grapefruit with some floral hints.  Taste is powerful and bitter, but very balanced.

Flavor profile is more of the same, offering up sticky resiny, dank, herbal and orange hops that clinge to the tongue long after a sip. Earthy, bready malts add a little depth and balance. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a lightly velvety, gritty grain to it. Consistency makes it easy to drink, but slightly filling.

Aromas of dark cacao nibs and roasty malts dominate; lighter hints of caramel, toffee, and milk chocolate influence the bouquet smoothly in the background.  Taste of dark chocolate and toasted granola upfront, with lighter tones of dark berries/stone fruits, smooth malty roast, and a faint milk chocolate imparting the slightest sweetness toward the finish; bits of booze are somewhat prevalent on the latter part of the profile.  Mouthfeel shows a nice medium body, slightly sticky, and with lower levels of carbonation with an occasional odd spike; hints of booze come through on occasion, but not enough to become a consistent distraction; a well incorporated package of sweet, dry, and roasty.  Integration of dark chocolate really evens out the expected stone fruit and dark berry tones, striking a nice balance where plenty of lighter (mainly sweeter) notes are given space to shine through. I do think this didn’t quite reach the next level, though, as the profile was muddied in spots, and the mouthfeel suffered from the occasional thinness and inconsistency. Overall a really solid brew that does shine in its approachable flavor and drinkability.","  rDev Served on tap in a 13 oz (385 ml) goblet at Alamo Drafthouse in Yonkers, NY.

How is it possible that a) I have NEVER previously reviewed this beer &amp; b) it will be my 4,400th on this site?!? I remember sharing a then-vintage bottle with Garrett Oliver &amp; FerMentor Lew Bryson at the State College Beer Expo in 2000(?)/2001(?). I LOVE Brooklyn Brewery &amp; I have visited many times over. I am flabbergasted that I have not reviewed this beer until now.   From the bottle:  This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Descended from the Russian Imperial Stouts of 18th Century, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. A blend of six malts produces its dark chocolate aroma and flavor. There is nothing better to enjoy with rich desserts, fine cheeses, and roaring fireplaces. ;  The Legendary Russian Imperial Stout .   Today is T, 20 June 2017.   Winter 2016: I Pop!ped the cap &amp; commenced a slow, gentle pour into an awaiting glass. Once decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised a finger of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with moderate retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled less like chocolate candy and more like fudge brownies. It was very rich and chocolaty, but also with a breadiness from the malt. Mouthfeel was big and full, like a scoop or dollop on my tongue. I let it lay there &amp; rolled it around to better get a sense of its flavors. Interestingly, it not only had the rich chocolaty fudginess that I noted on the nose, but it also tasted of cherries, raisins, tobacco &amp; charcoal smoke. Phew! Another no-playin'-around beer. Finish was dry, not sweet at all, with lingering cherry-chocolate flavors, like a torte.  Next, on W, 21 June 2017:   Limited Bottling - Winter '14 - '15 : I Pop!ped the cap &amp; performed a very gentle pour. The in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was really rich with a fudgy, chocolaty, brownie-like quality, underlain by a light smokiness and a malty breadiness. Mouthfeel was somewhat lighter than in the more recent batch. It was not as thick or chewy, but it was still bigger than simply  medium-bodied . The taste was MUCH more chocolaty without any of the fruity flavors noted earlier. It was like a rich, fudgy brownie at this point, almost a dessert beer, although a smokiness kept it in check. Finish was dry which I might have thought unexpected had I not noted such in the fresher batch.    Limited Bottling - Winter '12 - '13 ;  In the last century, British brewers made strong stouts for the Czar's Court. They were called Imperial Stouts. Our Black Chocolate Stout, brewed once yearly for the winter season, achieves a chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six varieties of black, chocolate and roasted malts.   Having Pop!ped the cap &amp; conducted a gentle pour, the in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, dark-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had begun to take on a pronounced smokiness, more roasty than chocolaty. Mouthfeel continued to moderate, becoming less thick &amp; chewy with each older iteration. The taste was more like raw baker's chocolate now, nary a hint of sweetness, but with a smoky, charcoal bitterness. Finish was quite dry at this point.","  rDev Pours pitch black with a thin tan head. Head dissipates leaving no residual head. Beer appears pretty thick.  Smell is roasty, with notes of chocolate, and some hoppy bitterness on the finish.  Taste is very roasty and chocolatey up front.

Loads of chocolate on the nose, with hints of raisins and roasted coffee. Tiny bits of booze also seep through.  The first thing you taste is dark chocolate, and lots of it. In between layers of the chocolate, you find tones of coffee and licorice. Long finish with quite a bit of roasted malt.  Soft liquid, just the right amount of carbonation. Mayve a little bit thin.  Overall, a good stout, at a price that is hard to beat. My only gripe is that is's a little bit too thin.","  rDev Beautiful pour, yielding a black chocolate color and a slightly reddish beige head. Head forms 1 finger and gradually recedes to a ring of lace.   Notes of roast malts, peppery coffee, chocolate, and cocoa.   Alcohol is apparent right from the get-go. It's a pleasant burning flavor without acridity or astringency. Lovely notes of chocolate and roast malts dance on and around the palate. Some tight licorice snap on the finish. As it warms up a few degrees the alcohol presence does become a touch astringent. Still, it's one of the better tasting Russian Imperial Stouts I've had.   Feel is pretty roasty as well, with hot, boozy alcohol dryness and burn. A dry, dry finish.   Overall the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a solid performer. It's got all the chocolate and roast notes, with only a hint of unfavorable astringency. One of my top favorite RIS's for sure.","  rDev Black with a thick tan blanket.

This one is always being discussed on the forums, but I can never seem to find it near me. Luckily when I stopped in Half Time the other day, they had some relatively fresh bottles, so I knew I had to pick it up. Let’s crack it open and see if it earns its title  Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of light brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  It’s just straight up malty goodness in the nose here. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bready malt, toast, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and molasses  It’s pretty similar in taste, but it takes on a bit more of an aggressive taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, dark toast, herbal hops, apple skin, toffee, sweet cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, molasses, burnt sugar, raisin, smoke, and herbal hops  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a rich beer.

Damn, it has this dark ruby appearance that just stares at you like Medusa when hungry for your soul. Wow, I can see why this one is special. It’s just perfectly put together like Barbara Palvin bathing in her mid century modern bath.  I’m gone.","  rDev Sample from bottle at Copenhagen Beer Festival 2013. Very dark ruby colour, nearly black. Moderate tan head. Surprisingly moderate aroma: dark bread, some caramel. Rich malty flavour, dark bread and caramel again, also some molasses, but not cloyingly sweet. Very moderate hops as expected. A good doppelbock, but way overrated.","  rDev L: A dark cherry coke hue, deep red at the fringes with loads of rising bubbles. Two fingers of light tan pillowy foam, with good retention. Leaves wavy lines of lace, and later wide bands that merge together beautifully.  S: Deep roasted malts and fresh hazelnuts, a light toffee. Faint and fleeting notes of leather, toasted oak, and dates. The nuttier aroma picks up as it comes to temp.   T: Oh wow. The nose is really typical of the style, not powerful, and only slightly nuanced, but the taste is impressively rich and balanced. Definitely the best of the style by far that I’ve ever had.

The skill of the brewers on exceptional display.","  rDev -clear, dark bottle pour with a deep rose hue and a 1.5 cm cap of tan foam.  The aroma is of caramel and toasted malt.  The flavor is rich with sweet malt, toffee, figs and dark coffee notes.  The flavors persist in the finish.  This is superb.","  rDev Drinking this at European Street Cafe in Jacksonville Florida on an unseasonably cold and blustery day. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appears a very dark amber, with a tannish foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin ring. Smells malty, sweet, coffee and chocolate. Taste follows the nose, complex and the beer changes noticeably as I drink it. Mouth feel is medium for a Dopplebock. Overall, this is definitely the best Dopplebock I have ever had out of a bottle and vying for best Dopplebock ever. I will definitely order again. Cheers!","  rDev Gorgeous mahogany brown color with a light tan head, the nose is filled with malty caramel aromas along with stone fruit notes. I am now officially salivating.  The caramel actually is closer to toffee on the taste, and the stone fruit is more pronounced, a black cherry flavor. The mouthfeel is medium, and well carbonated.  What a magnificent beer this is, especially on a chilly fall evening in Northern Indiana. World class, IMHO.","  rDev Poured from a bottle - dark and roasty with a short khaki head leaving scant lacing. Nose follows as does taste with a mild roasty malt flavor and a relatively smooth finish.","  rDev A 330ml bottle with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a Holy Mountain tulip glass.

Aroma: Sweet malty, doughy, coffee, caramel, grape jam, prune, fig, with a hint of clove.  Taste: Sweet, malty, doughy, roasty coffee, molasses, caramel, dark fruit, plum, prunes, fig, with a hint of clove and smoke.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, medium bodied with soft carbonation.

Caramel, stone fruits, raisins, chocolate, hints of roasted malts.  Deep, dark brown color with ruby highlights, 1/2 inch tan head that recedes quickly to a bubbly cap and ring.  Mouth feel has a smooth texture with a moderate to full body and leaves a smooth coating. Some carbonation feel.  Taste fairly complex with stone fruits, peach, some bitterness (which seems to be from the roasted malts, like the bitterness from coffee), caramel, earthy and roasted in the background. The taste is dry, despite the sweet aroma. The middle has a moderate bitterness. The finish is fruit and caramel, roasted malts and mostly dry. The fruit aftertaste fades fairly quickly leaving the roasted malts and only a slight alcohol heat in the throat.   Overall, an excellent beer with an excellent flavor.","  rDev Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip.  Pours nearly black, but translucent with red highlights. A single-finger head of tan foam. It doesn't last long. The lacing is just a thin rim, but it is persistent.  Dark toasted, but not charred malts hit the nose. Pumpernickel, fruitcake, molasses, dark cherry, candy apple, fig, raisins, prunes, bready yeast, carob/cocoa and tobacco. The aroma is a harbinger of a malt explosion.  The promise of the aroma is fulfilled on the tongue. The brew hits fruity-sweet on the tip of the tongue, with dark sugars and dark fruits as well as toffee and caramel. The mid-palate is hit with the toasted malt flavors, bread dough and yeast. It is here that the faint coffee, leather, and tobacco notes manifest The finish is an interesting meeting of slight booze, faint earthy hops, and soy sauce/brine.  The brew is medium full to full. Creamy, not sticky, with a touch of slickness. Limited carbonation but, for whatever reason, it isn't missed here.   An exemplary version, if not the paragon, of the style. Any markdowns are from a personal taste perspective, not  faults. ","  rDev L- Very dark brown, with flashes of ruby red if held to a light. Clear. Pours with 5mm ultra-fine bubble deep tan head. Holds well. S- Puddingy... as in a dark fruit crumble, or British Xmas pudding. Rich dark stewed fruits and malting.  T- Toasty, rich, perhaps slightly smokey, off into deep toasty malts. This is peak quality 'winter warmer' territory. F- Pungent depth, feels indulgent. The 6.7% fully comes through, no problem knowing this has that oomph. I don't notice anything out of place here. Becomes richer/a touch sweeter as it warms. One for me to slowly sip away on and savour. O- A superb beer, one I will buy again.

Smell has some quality depth - I think this is an unintended aged bottle - but the aroma has some an aged dark malt with plum like qualities, slight yeast and bready notes, maybe some dark sugar.   Taste is quite good with great depth - dark fruit, plum/raisin, bread, yeastiness, but more in a bready quality (yeast bread flavor), some roast seems to emanate as well.  Mouthfeel is moderate to crisp, still well carbonated after some aging, maybe some mineral qualities but good lingering sweetness seems to dominate.   Overall an excellent doppelbock with a flavor unique to its own - a bit more roast or darker malt than some of the others in the style but it assists with some depth after some aging.","  rDev Dark brown-amber with a massive off-white head. Smells of smoky malt and grainy, sweet rye bread. Taste is excellently balanced with string notes of bread, spice, sweet malts, and bits of caramel.

Some caramel and candied sugar. Taste is slightly sweet bread, with raisin, dates, and prunes. Burnt sugars and dark chocolate. Wisp of smoke. Medium mouth feel, easy drinking. Very solid example of beer style. Presents well, drinks smooth, with complex and enjoyable taste.","  rDev Pours a slightly cloudy, deep, dark mahogany coloration with a large, fluffy head. Smells of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt, some dark fruit notes of fig, raisin and plum and lighter notes of chocolate, licorice and herbal hops. Taste is a perfect, quite rich balance of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt and bitter, herbal, spicy hops, with some quite rich dark fruit notes of fig, raisin and plum, distinct chocolate and lighter notes of brown sugar, coffee, licorice and peppery spice. Finishes dry and bitter, with a very light sweetness and some dark fruit, chocolate and licorice lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.  So is Celebrator truly the king of Doppelbocks? In a word: yes! What I love about this the most is its somewhat dry and bitter character, being a lot less sweet than most Doppelbocks, with a bit more focus on the roasted rather than caramel malts as well. While there certainly is some caramel and brown sugar sweetness to this, as well as strong dark fruit and chocolate notes, these are kept in check very nicely by some quite earthy, herbal hops and spice, with the licorice being particularly distinct here, while body and mouthfeel are outstanding as well. Overall, this is just a superbly rich, complex and full-bodied Doppelbock with an outstanding balance of sweet and bitter, earthy notes that's definitely not easy-drinking, but something to be savored.","  rDev This beer pours a dark brown with a moderate head. The aroma features rich milk chocolate, dates, figs, banana bread, mild roast coffee, prune, honey, cinnamon and licorice. The flavor is redolent of fig, date, and prune, with slight bitterness in the form of coffee and dark chocolate, with background baking spice and licorice flavors. The mouthfeel is fairly full with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a world class beer for a reason. The depth of flavor is enormous, and the richness is well balanced with a hint of bitterness.","  rDev 11.2oz undated bottle poured into a .3L Celebrator pokal at fridge temp 6.7% ABV. The beer pours very dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a hint of lacing. The aroma is toffee, caramel and dark fruit. The taste is semisweet burnt sugar with some dried fruit highlights. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and smooth. The finish is slightly sweet with a hint of caramel, yet not cloying as it is very cleanly lagered. Overall, excellent. There is no way, for me, to accurately describe everything this beer has to offer. If you start cold, let it warm as the flavors only become more layered and delicious. Recommended.","  rDev 2017-12-05 330ml bottle served in a tulip. If there is a date, I don't see it.  Pours dark brown with a slight ruby tint around the edges, medium to small head with a lot of carbonation. Smell is nutty and sweet, dates and raisins.  Taste is not as sweet as it smells (which is a relief for me). The dates and raisins come through more than the nuttiness. A bit of roast characteristic.  Mouthfeel is light, smooth, effervescent.

The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with Pumpkin an Spices. Some of the spices are cinnamon pumpkin nutmeg an others. You also pick up a nice amount of grains an malts in the small as well. So far Punkin Ale is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with pumpkin spice , really puts you in that pumpkin pie state of mind. Not saying that is a bad thing. If you are a fan of pumpkin pie this brew is a must. Just the right amount of spicy, pumpkin mix. There is nothing overpowering about this pumpkin ale, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The body of this brew is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold Pumpkin, Sweet, Spicy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Punkin Ale a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the opportunity to. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery did a super nice job with this style of brew.","  rDev 12oz bottle from Brewers Haven. Clear amber, thin tight head. Aroma is pumpkin with light savory notes. Taste offers light cinnamon, pumpkin. Pretty simple and focused on the pumpkin.","  rDev Punkin from Dogfish Head. Purchased 18/9/21 from Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA for $3.18 (Including tax)/12 oz bottle ($ 0.265/oz). On room temperature shelf at store. Stored at home at 40 degrees. Reviewed 19/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Green ink on neck “Feb 2022”. Served at 45.5 degrees in a hand washed and dried John Smith imperial pint glass. Final temperature 52.7 degrees.  Appearance – 4. First pour – Pale gold (SRM 3) with slight greenish tint, clear.  Body – Deep gold (SRM 6), faint haze. When rear-lite, same. Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), darker than floral white and lighter than Dutch white, medium density, average retention, diminishing to a three mm crown and a complete cap with a few rocks.  Lacing – Poor. A few drag marks as the level drops. Aroma – 3.75 – Light pumpkin spices, predominantly clove and allspice, no malt, no hops, no yeast, no pumpkin.  Flavor – 3.25 – Flavor follows nose - no yeast, no malt, lightly sweet and no hops. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. No gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  Palate – 3.5 – Thin, watery, soft carbonation.  Final impression and summation: 3.5 Billed as “Brown ale brewed with pumpkin and spices” but there are darn few brown ale characteristics and the pumpkin appears imaginary. My fruit fly drinking buddy, however, has a fatal attraction to it.","  rDev This happened to be on tap at a local Cajun restaurant so I gave it a try. Poured into a shaker pint. Golden yellow color with some head and good curtain lacing. Smell was disappointing but slightly cinnamony. Pumpkin spice flavor subtle but distinct. Flavor of cinnamon and all spice. Overlay, I am happy I gave it a try.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Bottom neck is stamped for best by date of 'Jan 2022', Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. Aggressive pour brought forth a two finger milky white head. Attractive tiny rising bubble show. A nearly full wall of lacing follows down the body. Aroma of toasted malts layered with pumpkin spices and brown sugar. Taste is a well balanced blend of toasted malts, brown sugar and pumpkin spices. Gives off a gourd vibe. Medium mouth feel. Good, supportive carbonation. Very pleasant tasting fall seasonal with reminders of pumpkin with its spices, brown sugar, and a backbone of malts.","  rDev A - Dark orange amber color with thick ivory colored lacing.  S - Punkin, gourds, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar.  T - Punkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and a balanced finish with gourds and spice lingering on the backside.

Not my favorite, but good.","  rDev 12oz bottled in August and served in a NB globe; clear copper with a quickly-dying head and no lace; subtle impressions of brown sugar and baking spices, ghostly notes of toasted malt; flavors are balanced between sweeter malt and those pumpkin pie spices with a yammy undertone. Smooth and light.","  rDev A rather crystal clear copper liquid poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a clear pint glass. With it came, surprisingly, very little of the spicy aroma expected from this style. That's not such a bad thing. No noteworthy head nor glass lacing. The taste is of a pleasant brown ale, with but not entirely overwhelmed, by pumpkin pie spices. Pumpkin was likely the starch used when English settlers made their first beers in the New World. It's very unlikely that any of the spices we now associate with pumpkin were included in the mix. Unfortunately, they're noticable in this beer. Fortunately, this one isn't as offending as most and has a bit of a brown ale base to carry it.","  rDev Poured from12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It pours a hazy, pretty, amber-orange color with a half finger of creamy, ecru-colored head and a thin but creamy sheen of lacing. The nose is fragrant with aromas of pumpkin, brown sugar, nutmeg, and clove. There is also a buttery malt that is reminiscent of pie crust. The taste opens with fairly strong clove and nutmeg with milder notes of pumpkin. There is also a strong malty backbone. While it's initially quite sweet, there is a surprising bitterness that starts mid-palate and remains to the finish. It's clean and crisp with pleasant carbonation, and it's easily drinkable at 7% ABV. Overall, Punkin Ale is a good representation of the style but I prefer Schafly, Pumpking, and Weyerbacher.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a Nonic pint.  Pours crystal clear light copper with a nice creamy foamy head and good lacing.   The brew has a restrained but sweet aroma, with plenty of pumpkin spice and honey/brown sugar.  Sweet on the tip of the tongue; caramel malts and brown sugary sweetness. In midstream, the spice rack arrives. It ends up a little  muddy  as a result--like when you put a little too much dry herbs or spices into something. The close is just a touch boozy and provides some welcome earthy/grassy bitterness. I didn't find this as sweet-toothy as some others have.  Medium full bodied. Smooth and creamy yet with a touch of drying at the finish.  Overall, it has some great aggressive notes on the palate, but there is so much spice that no one spice note can get enough breathing room to clarify what it is. It's just  punkin pie spice  on overload.","  rDev Medium bodied with light carbonation  Aroma is malt,earthy , nutmeg and other spices but not in an overpowering way Taste is mildly sweet with an equal mild hop bite in the finish that lingers. Definitely malt and spice dominate but it's done well and didnt make me gag on an abundance of pumpkin spice  The base beer was probably very good and helped make this a better than average seasonal beer","  rDev Bottled on 8/5/19  Pours a deep, slightly foggy copper body with a a few fingers of foamy, off-white head; very good retention sees a frothy collar and webby gobs of dense, soapy lacing form against the glass.  Aromas of pumpkin spice open, followed with robust hints of sweet pumpkin and toasted malts, and even lighter coffee roast and earthy tones; fall spice is more prominent as the bouquet closes.  Taste follows the aroma to a tee, with pumpkin spice meshed with toasty caramel malts, nutmeg, cinnamon, and lightest notes of earthy, roasted coffee rounding the profile out.  Mouthfeel is just a shade shy of medium bodied with moderate, semi-spritzy/semi-gritty carbonation; largely dry across the mid-palate into the finish, with touches of sweetness and roasty char appearing throughout.  The brown ale base definitely comes through, imparting a noticeable malty quality that leverages the spices in favor of overall drinkability; a satisfying pumpkin ale delivering on an all-around balance for a fall seasonal.","  rDev 12oz bottle, dated 08.29.19, poured into a 16oz tumbler glass.  The beer pours a nice amber color, copper hues that has a nice clarity and a bone colored head that rises about two or three fingers tall with good retention and nice spots of soapy lacing. The aroma is very pleasant, amber grains, caramel, nutmeg, pumpkin, pie spicing but with a nice nuttiness underneath. The flavors are good, smooth and toasted amber grains, caramel and brown sugar with a really ample fall spice character, soft pumpkin pie with a little nutty character of the underlying brown ale. The mouthfeel is good, coating and lively medium body that is smooth and full with a soft finish.  Verdict: A nice pumpkin beer from Dogfish Head. One of the classics of the style, not quite as boisterous as Pumking but a well rounded beer that plays off the adjuncts as well as the brown ale base. An annual treat.","  rDev 12oz bottled 08/02/19 (2 months ago) poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours bright medium amber in color with khaki head. The head recedes to a thin layer of bubbles and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is pumpkin pie spice, pumpkin and some malt in the background. The taste is more of the same with nutmeg, cinnamon and slight pumpkin up front, ending abruptly with a drying, mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, good. I sample and rate one pumpkin beer a year and this was the one for 2019.

Cinnamon, cloves, coriander. Cocoa and caramel malts. Medium bodied. Not over the top pumpkin which is nice.","  rDev Clear amber brown color with white cap and lacing.  Aroma of sweet malt with spiced pumpkin in the background.  Taste on entry is a nutty sweet malt with spiced pumpkin icing on top. An element of sweetness from start to finish yet the sweetness complements rather than intrudes. The spiciness may be nutmeg or that may be my imagination. It does all blend well together making for a fairly complex beer with all parts singing in harmony.  Medium texture with balancing carbonation.  Pumpkin beers in general, to my tasting, have a routine sort of pattern as of course they must emphasize pumpkin in some way which may result in a single dimension sort of flavor, especially ones that get carried away with the spices. This is round, rich, smooth with low bitterness and very enjoyable for the style.","  rDev Pours a beautiful clear amber, bordering brown, with about an inch and a half of off-white head settling to a cap  The aroma is more pumpkin forward than the taste, with spices covering the back end of the aroma  The taste is more subtly pumpkin, with a lightly spicy brown sugar malt base carrying this brew  In this case, the mouthfeel is a bit heavier than it needs to be for the style, as I was hoping for a bit more carbonation  Overall, this is a well executed pumpkin beer that is understated flavor-wise and is best as a sipper as the weather cools","  rDev Pours a clear, very dark amber with a thin white head that leaves a little lacing. Smells and tastes of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin, brown sugar, malts and some vanilla. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth mouth feel.","  rDev From notes 10/14/12: Pour a coppery amber producing 2 fingers of off-white, somewhat lasting head that leaves a thin film of lace. Aroma is brown sugar, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon and vegetal pumpkin wrapped in toasted and caramel malt. Taste is like the nose but a little more malt forward. Finish and aftertaste are spice heavy. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, fairly smooth with a light creaminess but a bit sticky.","  rDev Punkin Ale has a thin, off-white head, a clear, bubbly, orange appearance, and no glass lacing. Aroma is of faint spices and pumpkin meat, with some strong malt. Taste is similar, with a sort of high-gravity malt liquor back note. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Punkin Ale finishes mostly crisp.   RJT","  rDev Surprisingly delicious pumpkin ale - this from someone that doesn't really like strong pumpkin flavors and all the spices that go along with it. Nice orange color with some fluffy white head and very spotty lingering lacing. Smells of pumpkin, spices (nutmeg and cinnamon), some vanilla. Tastes similarly, along with some caramel, brown sugar and malt. But boy that pumpkin taste is well-balanced with the beer, and never overwhelms it. Smooth mild slightly creamy mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Dogfish Head does it again! I already have many more pumpkin beers from other breweries to try at home.","  rDev Bottled 8/14/18; drank 9/5/18 @ the Yarchives.

O: Probably the best of the 'pumpkin' beers... which is kind of like being the thinnest kid at fat camp, but this one's pretty drinkable... kind of an 'after dinner' beer, and I'm good for maybe 2 of these each fall.","  rDev I really like how they put this ale together. Mostly malt. Modest spicing. Thanksgiving in a bottle. Having Had 14 now from Dogfish Head, I probably am entitled to pronounce them one of the most creative brewers I know. The temptation in a subtle ale is to try to do too much. They did just enough to convince me that having only one this year would be a mistake. Punkin Ale is back on my list.","  rDev This beer pours a clear amber with a large head. The aroma is very reminiscent of a sweet bread - with cinnamon, banana, brown bread, and nutmeg. The flavor is fairly mellow and balanced, with cinnamon and nutmeg leading the way, followed by banana bread, coffee, milk chocolate, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is reasonably light with a mild, foamy carbonation. Overall this is a nice little beer, very restrained and balanced, and super easy to drink.","  rDev Look - copper color with a big lasting slightly tan head Smell - allspice, pumpkin and brown sugar Taste - taste like an amber with allspice and pumpkin Feel - medium body with a slight creaminess and slight carbonation Overall - I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers but this is ok","  rDev on draft, in shaker pint  appears medium brown in color, white head. nice spicy herbal pumpkin pie spice - nutmeg, cinnamon. not really any pumpkin proper flavor, more the spices. medium bodied."]},{"Name":"Edmund Fitzgerald","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/73/226/","Brewery":"Great Lakes Brewing Co.","Style":"Porter - American","Alcohol":6.00,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev Look: It pours very dark brown with a tan head.

Overall it has a nice feel.  Aroma is roasted malt, milk and dark bakers chocolate, black coffee, some raisins and dark fruit.  Taste is everything I would want from a porter. Some coffee grind bitterness with dark chocolate, dark fruit and roasted malt and black coffee.  This is totally worth a try. I often forget how good it is then I buy a six pack to remind myself.

Drink by date 07/17/21 today 5/11/21 Looks dark brown almost black with a nice tan foamy head that dropped to a thick cap. Smells malty, sweet, bready, chocolate, spicy. Taste follows the nose nicely with enough spiciness to keep my interest. Mouth feel is medium for the style with a nice creamy finish. Overall a very fine Porter that just might be my new go to Porter.","  rDev Restrained aroma, but I pick up sweetness, chocolate, some (but not much) roasted malts.  Deep dark brown color, with dark red revealed with a back-light along with ample carbonation. 1½ inch tall, thick, tan head with very good retention, leaving rings of lacing as it recedes.  Very nice flavor. Raisins, coffee, chocolate, and a little spice. As with the aroma, very mild roasted malts. No bitterness at all (well, a little in the aftertaste as the beer warms). Slightly sweet initially, which carries through to the finish. The finish is sweetish with a bit of spiciness.  Mouth feel is appropriately moderately thin, creamy though, with at least a little carbonation feel.  Overall, a well done traditional American porter. Great Lakes keeps to the basics with this one, and I appreciate that. The light spiciness is a good touch. Easy drinking and enjoyable.","  rDev Best By date : 6/9/21 . Let sit out for ~5 minutes before opening.   Dark mahogany-brown, with one finger+ of tan head.   Smells of nutty,roasty malt, with slight aromas of cocoa and damp/earthy decaying wood.   Taste is all of the elements in the aroma, plus a bit of cola. Moderate drying bitterness.   Feel is initially creamy, with some light,soft carbonation burn/bite coming in near finish.   Overall, a pleasant, easy-drinking classic . :) The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.","  rDev Had Edmund Fitzgerald poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped enjoy by  1/18/21,  delivered by daughter, into small chalice.  Pours apparently black but a beautiful deep red when backlit, with not much very light tan head, leaving only a little sketchy lace. Aroma is hop spice and mild roast malts. A milder porter, creamy and sweet, with mild roast and caramel malts before a crisp hoppy finish.","  rDev A: Pours a near pitch black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap  S: Roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and some light char  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the roasted malt, coffee, and char. Goes into the dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops. Also some tobacco notes. Finishes with lingering char and coffee  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A classic porter that is sure to please. Definitely on the complex side for a straight-up porter but still super approachable. Definitely worth a drink","  rDev Immensely drinkable. This delivers everything a good porter should. The roasted malt takes charge, as it should. Very clean finish that entices a repeat visit.","  rDev Pours a nice shade of brown. 2 1/2 finger tan head. Retention is decent. Some lacing on the glass.  The nose has got a lot of chocolate on it. There's a slight roast aroma to it as well.  Taste - There is some chocolate in it. It's more of a bitter dark chocolate - which I'm a huge fan of. There's a slight smoke flavor here. Slight sweetness, that I just can't fully place or describe.  Feel - This is actually lighter bodied. Not watery, but lighter than I was expecting. There's a bitterness that lingers in my palate.  Interesting and tasty beer.","  rDev Picked up a single from TW Arrowhead 11-13-18 for $1.99. Best by 4-7-19; consumed on 3-5-19. Cold stored since purchase.  Beer poured brown with a nice off white head that has some good hang time.  Nose is mild roasted malts and chocolate.  Taste is chocolate malts forward, a touch of coffee and smoke with a sweet but hop balanced finish.  Mouthfeel is full for the abv, very smooth and satisfying.  Overall it has been a pleasure to finally have the legendary legacy brew Edmund  Larry  Fitzgerald here in Arizona.  I am very familiar with the sad story of the namesake brew...If it is still available i will definitely grab a sixer!","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Dark, dark brown pour... nearly black with 2 fingers of foamy tannish head. Great lacing.  S: Roast and coffee mixed with burned sugars.  T/F: Follows the nose. Roasted grains/malts and sweet burned sugars. Coffee and dark cocoa... Bitter roast and mild hops play nicely with the dark sugars giving a complex and balanced brew. Medium to light bodied... well carbonated. The finish is more bitter roast and sweet sugars.  O: A really nice porter, and easy to see why this is one of Great Lakes flagship beers.","  rDev Solid, but really more mediocre than anything else. Lacks depth and dryness that the great porters have.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb 2/6/19 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 6% ABV 37 IBU. The beer pours dark brown with ruby highlights and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is faint baker's chocolate, roasted malt and earthy hops. The taste is roasty malts and firm, earthy (roast driven) bitterness throughout. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and nearly dry in the finish. There is a creaminess to the body that offsets the roasty bitterness, especially as the beer warms. Overall, very good. This is a beautiful unadulterated American porter. I will also add that there is no tangy aspects to this beer which I, personally, do not enjoy.","  rDev Bottle. The third part of a mix pack that contained 3 of 4 brewskis I always wanted to try. The first two were good but a bit overrated. This one sorta falls into a similar category. I said that these beer averages really just speak to the strength of the Great Lakes brand - especially to Beeradvocate users. This is a solid, solid porter but damn that's a high rating. Tried and true nose and flavor. Leaning towards the lighter side in both areas. Follow suit with the others.","  rDev  Enjoy by 10/10/16 ; drank 7/6/16 @ the Yarchives.   Opaque dark brown appearance.   A rough pour yielded a small khaki head; nice lace.   Dark roast coffee bean, fresh earth, burnt caramel &amp; faint cream notes in the nose. Enticing!   Medium mouthfeel.   Cream &amp; dark roast coffee bean flavors up front; hop bite on the finish.   The nose promised porter bliss, but the simplified flavor disappointed &amp; the hop bite mixed in gave this a pickle juice aftertaste. Too bad...","  rDev Nice smooth, drinkable porter. Dark brown, almost black color with some tan head and a little lingering lacing. Smells of dark coffee and malt. Tastes of dark coffee roast, sweet malt, caramel and a little vanilla and chocolate. Barely any hops presence. Smooth clean finish with mild mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation throughout.","  rDev Pours black with a finger of khaki foam that fades fairly quickly leaving behind a few strands of lacing. Aroma is toasted, nutted, biscuit, earthy malts. Herbal, and pine hops give it a little hoppy zing, but nothing that tips the scales out of favor of the malts. Flavor profile is smooth notes of toasted, nutted, biscuit, earth, and caramel malts that blend together to form a splendid porter. Hints of herbal and pine hops further deepen the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a crisp, liveliness that rewards every sip. Overall, a lovely porter with a diverse array of malts. The diversity of malts along with a small addition of hops keeps this beer drinking splendidly smooth and well-balanced.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Pours an almost espresso color. Dark malt and cocoa dominate the aromas. Flavors follow through from the aroma, with tons of chocolate and coffee, offset by a caramel sweetness. Easy drinking with a dry finish.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Best by date stamped on label is '05/15/18'. Clear, deep brown colored body. One finger, light tan and creamy head persists. Some spots of lacing left behind with each sip. Aroma is dark roasted malts, with a slight char. Dark coffee and dark chocolate add in.  Taste is well balanced with dark roasted malts, dark black coffee, and dark chocolate. Very little bitterness. Smooth, medium mouth feel. Toward the dry side. Very well crafted porter. Appearance, aroma, and taste all come together for an enjoyable porter beer experience.","  rDev Bottle from Consumers Beverage. This one’s reputation precedes it. Excellent throughout. Near black pour with tight, creamy beige head, leaves rings of lacing all the way down. Aroma is chocolate, roast malts, coffee. Taste is sweet, chocolate, burnt toast. Feel is creamy and slick. Sweet bitterness lingers. Perfect porter, benchmark for the style.","  rDev The appearance is black with some very dark brown highlights. The head is creamy tan with long retention, eventually dying down into a film that leaves streaky lacing behind.  The aroma is unsweetened dark chocolate and baking cocoa. Some acrid black coffee. Black licorice and star anise. Burnt toast.  The taste is bitter dark chocolate and black coffee upfront. Follows with burnt toast and hints of toffee. Black licorice and star anise work their way in and provide some mild spiciness. Finishes earthy with just a hint of vanilla, and then a surprising bitterness that lingers of burnt grains and black coffee.  The feel is the lighter side of medium, well-carbonated, smooth. Almost watery momentarily, but rounds out by the finish. Slightly sticky.  Overall, a really solid and enjoyable porter. Very well made.","  This is very nice porter. It pours a very dark brown with two fingers of head. The aroma is of coffee, roasted malts, with a nutty finish. The taste is of slightly burnt bread, coffee and some hop bitterness.","  rDev Pours a very dark black with a thick light caramel colored head on top. Can smell roasted malts and hints of coffee. Has a roasted malt and chocolate taste with a coffee after taste.","  rDev L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown color and an opaque consistency. There was a half inch of foamy, tan-colored head that lasted an average amount of time. So-so lacing.  S: A decent, if a little underwhelming, aroma of malt, chocolate, light hops, and coffee.  T: Tasted of a bit of chocolate (definitely could have used more), a lot of roasted malt, a creamy quality, a hint of coffee (only evident in the finish), a chalky lactose quality, and some hops. Like the aroma, the taste was a little on the muted side, with none of the ingredients really standing out. Not a terrible flavor, but not outstanding.  F: A decent amount of carbonation with a mostly dry finish. Medium-bodied.  O: It's kind of hard to reconcile the high rating of this beer with its actual nature. Could have been better.","  rDev On tap at Vinsetta Garage, Berkeley, Michigan on 02/17/17.","  rDev Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is coffee, chocolate and caramel. Tastes of coffee and chocolate with a hint of caramel. Good mouth feel.","  rDev Pours close enough to black that the brown highlights hardly matter. Brief foamy head that left a thin cap floating atop the beer.  On the nose, the first impact is chocolate followed by roasty malt. As it warmed up a little, there was a hint of sweetness.  The taste is very good. Taste leads with malt, but eventually is taken over by a slightly sweet chocolate note that is strong on the chocolate. Right on the finish there is a notable floral presence and a bit of a bitter bite that I assume is amplified some by whatever hops are used. All in all, a clean tasting, well crafted porter.  The feel has a bit of carbonation  sting  to it, but the general feel is smooth and almost creamy. Not too thick on the body - medium at best which is fine for the style. There is a little lingering chalky feel and a residual flavor of chocolate that gets a bit sweeter as it fades.  Overall, this is a very good porter. Whether it is worthy of the hype is debatable in my mind. I can't say I have had better, but I have certainly had at least two equals. Good beer, highly recommended.","  rDev DATE: April 27, 2017...

Distinctly hoppy flavour, piney and resinous notes, also grapefruit. Very bitter finish, but also very moreish and drinkable for its strength.","  rDev Clear, bright golden coloring, lush white, long-lasting head. Lookin' fine. That ain't no lie.  Aroma: honey-sweet, tropical fruit bitter. Citra? Mosaic? Another hot hop I haven't thought of? Nicely balanced, plenty of hop flavor, little bitterness.  Taste: Hop bitterness right away, gliding the palate, stays calm and cool. Modicum of sweetness strokes the tongue, bumps up against bitterness, and the slide together down the throat. Malt body is medium-ish, light, not getting in the way of the hops. Alcohol isn't felt, but hinted at. Oh, wait, there it is…  Dirt Wolf isn't a pretty name, but I assume it has links to the lore of hops. Before I check the label to see for sure, I will add my final thoughts. This is right on the money, delicious, balanced double IPA that perfectly fits the mold set by Bell's HopSlam. It's a good formula that's proven popular. And easy to market:  Can't find any HopSlam? Think HopSlam's too expensive? Try this, it's just as good!  I almost wrote  almost , but, really, it's just as good.

Looks like a classic West Coast IPA, with a citrusy, dank aroma to match. Drinks juicy and finishes bitter with a bit more malt than typical, a plus in my opinion.","  rDev An absolutely beautiful pour. Even cold, there's a lovely soft white head and plenty of lacing on the quickly emptying glass. Steadfastly on the clear side, even during this unfiltered/hazy era. Not much aroma, but the nose will tell you the taste of hops will follow. That taste is just about perfect. The malts provide a solid background while the sharp dry hops deliver all you could hope for. This is so tasty, so smooth going down and brings a perfect hop delivery, at 8.7 ABV, this could be trouble.","  rDev Dirtwolf pours with a beautiful head and a clear golden color with good carbonation. Smells more malty than citrus and hoppy. Taste is excellent. Definitely malty. Slightly hoppy. A nice blend and not too bitter or sweet and very crisp. Has a thinner but nice mouthfeel.

Aroma is exceedingly floral with an exceptionally detailed malt backbone; grass, dank stone fruits, and mild bubblegum sweetness add to the overall bouquet; intense mingling of delicate and dank.  Taste is brightly floral and piney/resinous, supported by a bruising malt backbone and brooding dankness under the surface; plenty of grapefruit and tangerine zest come through in the way of citrus, while bitter herbs add a further earthy component.  Mouthfeel is taut and crisp on the palate with a medium body and carbonation aiding a mild creaminess on the palate; sticky in parts, but ultimately drys nicely into the swallow, and aside from some slight bitterness, mostly clean finish.  Classic take on the style that goes down like nothing but still manages to feel ‘big’; a little citrus, a little sweet, a little bitter; an 8.7% that makes you just want more.","  rDev Very nice double IPA with some great flavors and nice blend of hops. Pours a slightly darker yellow color with some faint haze, small amount of white foamy head and some spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice combination of citrus zest and floral hops - and those floral hops really pop at the end of a long inhale. Also a little malt, vanilla and caramel. Tastes of fruity hops - mainly grapefruit, mango, tangerine and pineapple. The floral hops are less pronounced. Nice notes of vanilla, bread, caramel and malt. Smooth, clean, crisp, mild mouthfeel and good carbonation. I didn’t experience as much bitterness as other reviews had described - instead, I was struck by the bright floral hoppy notes and good mild malt backbone that didn’t overwhelm the flavors. Very well done.","  rDev Pours a crystal clear light honey yellow with a large white head with staying power. Nice lacing. Aroma is full of citrus fruits and a touch of dankness. Flavor is sweet ripe citrus up front with a strong bitter finish. Feel is medium light with great carbonation.

O: A very drinkable and enjoyable EC DIPA.","  rDev Pours a clear gold with a nice head. The initial aroma is grassy with some pine notes, grapefruit, but very subtle. The first sip brings mild piney and grassy hops up front, with moderately bitter finish. This beer has a medium body, medium carbonation, and a substantial alcohol warmth. Nothing jumps out at me however. Its very balaced is the best compliment I can give it.","  rDev I think this is Victory's best beer. Storm King still a formidable challenger though, being former champion and all. Pours a hearty golden color, 1/3  white head on the top. Aroma smacks of dry hopping, they really nailed this, has all the proprietary aroma hops like Mosaic and Citra.   Standard hop bearers like Simcoe &amp; Chinook provide the bittering. They got away from using excessive caramel like malts like they did in Hop Wallop and that other hoppy beer of theirs (I forget the name). This is a light Golden Promise(?) like affair, just pale, lightly toasted malt that lets the hops shine. Equal parts citrus, tropical and pine. Any use of caramel is well restrained. Price is good, availability is good, alcohol well hidden. Sure, you could stand in line for hours at a time and spend $5 a can on something comparable. But don't you have more of a life than that? Grab a 4 or 6 of this from the gas station and go chat up some honeys, not neckbeards in line.","  rDev So, I've seen this in beer stores coast to coast for years and am psyched to finally be giving this beast its due. Pale in color with lots of carbonation and limited head and almost no lace. Nose is grassy with citrus and medicine with booze lingering in the background.   Serious hops and pine in the flavor, but withering bitterness is not brutal and the alcohol is likewise under control. Balance is nil but that kind of goes with the territory. Serious lemon and medicine flavors dominate. Texture is thick but doesn't completely mask the octane. A little simplistic, but delivers on its promises.   Personally, I could go for a little more nuance, but Dirtwolf makes no apologies, and I can respect that.","  rDev I had this on draught in a bar. 16 oz. pour served in a pint glass. It pours a crystal clear, golden color with a milk-white head and minimal lacing. It smells of melon, pineapple, grapefruit, pine needles, floral hops, and a whiff of vanilla. The first taste sensation is sweet melon and caramel on the tip of the tongue but it is quickly overwhelmed by the resinous Mosaic and Simcoe hops. It finishes biting and bitter and leaves a strong, bitter aftertaste. Yet, the sweet, malty opening and the hoppy, bitter finish blend seamlessly. This ale is medium-bodied with lively carbonation, and its 8.7% ABV gives it a nice kick. Overall, this DIPA is well-balanced and very tasty. And it proves that a DIPA doesn't have to be turbid to be really satisfying. Well done!","  rDev Appearance - Pours clear golden color with thick white head, sticky lacing all around the glass.  Aroma - Lots of citrus grapefruit and orange a hint of pineapple. Slight hop pine aroma as well.  Taste - Wow very tasty, lots of citrus more than the nose showed. Orange, pineapple, mango and grapefruit. There are also sweet caramel and some malts in there as well. The flavor is super balanced.  Feel - Medium bodied well carbonated, just a touch of dry finish and no sign of the alcohol, slightly slick feel.  Overall - A very well done DIPA, the citrus and hop/pine is very well balanced.","  rDev Pours golden with about an inch of head. The aroma is very hoppy but without being intense. Taste is very bitter upfront, with some balancing maltiness toward the end. Medium body. Not the most complex of DIPAs but overall a very enjoyable example of the style.","  rDev From the growler, the last of the keg pours a deep golden color with a modest head. Malt and citrus hops in the nose. The mouth gets the hop notes without getting unpleasantly bitter.

Oily pineapple, orange zests, pine needles &amp; resin. Spicy, peppery &amp; pungent. The vegetable &amp; onion notes are still present but greatly subdued from what they are in the nose. Malts provide cane syrup &amp; caramel tones. Alcohol spice is prominent. Huge hop bite &amp; bitterness from start through aftertaste. Floral tones &amp; hints of dark tea in the finish. This brew is exquisitely bitter with complex hoppiness. Mouthfeel exhibits moderately heavy body &amp; carbonation, is prickly with spice, dry, slightly chewy, pungent, &amp; mildly astringent.

Aroma. Is very floral. Slight lemon lime.  taste is same,but a little pissy... Good kick. Alcohol is present late. A touch Warming.   Somehow, not a fan of the hop mix used in this; must be the chinook? that ruins it, since I know I like the other 3.   **","  rDev Finally getting a chance to tick this. Enjoy by date 12/5/16. 12oz bottle into 10oz goblet. Poured a lightly hazy deep yellow color, with about 1/2 inch of white head that had light-moderate retention and light lace.  The aroma did have an aspect of musty dirt, close to the dictionary definition of dank in fact. Hop forward, with a light malt scent in the background. Taste was the same musty, earthy, mildly funky.  Body was light-medium, with a mostly dry finish. Drinkability was a bit of a chore, due to the basement dank. Overall, I didn't miss anything with initial hype this beer received. Go ahead and tick it if you haven't, but you haven't missed anything.","  rDev DirtWolf brewed by Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown, with an ABV of 8.70% This brew pours out a deep golden amber color with a small white head. The smell of DirtWolf is rich with hops, grains and malts. There is also a rich sweetness in the smell of this IPA. This double IPA has the look and smell of most IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold with Hoppy goodness. Then the brew smooths out with grains and malts. There is a lot going on in DirtWolf. Victory DirtWolf also has a nice amount of lacing to it. The hops are bold and rich but not overpowering. DirtWolf has a real nice balance to it, this brew goes down nice and smooth. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.70% ABV in this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. The mouth feel of DirtWolf is bold , hoppie,rich, clean, and refreshing. If you are a fan of hops look this one up. Overall I'm giving DirtWolf a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again.

Overall, an excellent DIPA with grapefruit zest/bitter hop linger.","  rDev Clear golden color -- syrupy-looking with a small trickle of bubbles rising slowly from the bottom -- with two fingers of very airy yellow-tinted head that leave decent lacing. Aroma of pine and honeydew, with a little skunk and maybe a little mango and pineapple behind. Similar flavors up front in the nose, with a highly bitter, almost astringent aftertaste. There's also an earthy, tea-and-twig-like element to the flavor. Extremely prickly mouthfeel with high carbonation. Interesting. I remember having this on tap a couple years ago and loving it. Picked this four-pack up fresh from the brewery, and it's not quite what I remember.","  rDev Poured on draft.   Look is a darker yellow with little to no head.

Appearance is sparkling wedding ring gold with a fuzzy convex off-white to khaki head that dies quickly to nothing, becoming a mead-like visual in the glass overall.  The overwhelming breadiness of this beer used to be so comforting to me, but now I notice more than anything the sweetness. Corn flavors. A touch of white grape. The effervescence.  It's not anywhere near as sweet as the terrible Bud Light, but it's still quite crisp, with a medium-light, smooth silky body that finishes semi-dry, but it's also kind of soda-like.

I was never a big Budweiser drinker back in the day - Bud Light was much more commonly available - but it’s cheap, easy to find, quenches the thirst and is very widely accepted by all. Looks fairly clear, golden, clean with a little foaming white head that quickly dissipated. No real lacing to speak of. Smells mainly of grain and corn, just a little malt. Tastes similarly, with very little aftertaste. No skunkiness or bitterness. Clean, thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Goes flat fairly rapidly, however. All in all, a safe beer but not my go-to AAL.","  rDev I can't tell you the last time I had a Budweiser, but we had a Super Bowl party and I bought a six pack for one of our guests.

Finished cleanly and  crisply with light corn cereal notes. It's been about 15 years since a had a Bud....basically since I discovered what good beer really is. There is nothing offensive with this beer. No off flavors or aromas. It doesn't taste bad. It just generally lacks character of any kind. No head, very light aromas, not much happening with feel, and lifeless flavor. On a positive note, it's better than Bud Light. Very easy drinking and crush able, but a pretty bland offering.","  rDev From notes 12/10/11: Pours clear pale gold with a 1-2 inch shortlived , white head that leaves little lacing. Aroma is bready with thin grain, cereal, honey and lemon hops. The lager yeast is very noticeable. Taste is a similar more robust version of the nose with the yeast very prominent. Alcohol is more detectable than most 5.0 ABV's even in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation.","  rDev I deleted my earlier review and started all over now that we get full strength Bud in Oklahoma. I am using a new review format similar to the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) Score Sheet.  Appearance: Pours to generous white head that falls to a thin ring and uneven lacing. Moderate to low head retention. Pale gold-yellow with brilliant clarity.   Aroma: Extremely low levels of malt or grain. Super clean with no off-aromas but exceptionally bland and devoid of malt or hop characteristics. Some alcohol and cooked rice notes. Slight fruit likely from the A-B house lager yeast and short lagering cycle.   Flavor:  Folks, if you want a full flavor beer that is easy to drink and inoffensive and tastes the least like beer at a premium domestic price point then Bud is your jam. Clean, crisp and watery with seltzer, mixed with light cereal grain flavors and a slight crackery finish. No real hop bitterness to speak of.   Mouthfeel: Light mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation. No astringency or harshness at all. This is where Bud shines. It feels refreshing and comforting, especially in the face of a hot day outside with baseball and hot dogs. If there is ever to be a case in favor of Bud being the Great American Lager, this is where it resides.   Overall: In the grand scheme of beers, Budweiser is ripe for extinction on the following points:  1) Consumers are choosing beer less overall.  2) Those that DO like beer tend to choose beer that is either: ----a) super light (mich ultra, anyone?) ----b) super cheap (natty, the beast, malt liquors) ... or  ----c) more flavorful/craft beers.  --------Bud is 0 fer 3 on that scale.   The market for bland, flavorless non-light, premium AALs is shrinking.  The Bud name may have hope of living on as Bud Light , Bud Copper Lager, Bud Platinum or something else.   Let's face it. Traditional red-label Budweiser and it's tobacco counterpart Marlboro reds are riding off into the sunset.","  rDev Average lager, despite the hype and advertising budget. Pours clear golden with thick airy head, aroma is faint cereal, taste is more cereal and almost no hops. Refreshing, but not much else to say in the way of flavor.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a chalice glass; best by 13 July 18.  A: Pours a crystal clear, golden color with a one inch, white head, low retention and no lacing to speak of.  S: Floral and apple notes with grainy maltiness, but very low aroma overall.  T: Light and refreshing with light maltiness and very light bitterness leading to refreshing finish.  M: Light bodied with low volume but persistent effervescence.  O: I find the unusually low scores a bit inconsistent with reality. Budweiser is an American adjunct lager and a very well made one. It is not going to have the “big” flavors of many other styles, nor should it, as it is basically designed to be light and refreshing (and is). No fan of the “Macrobreweries,” but it does not mean the beer is not well made.

Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread, light biscuit/dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/grain and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread, light biscuit/dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread, light biscuit/dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/grain and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors; with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery. Zero warming alcohol for 5%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness of pale malt/grain and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. I liked that they don't use corn, so you don't get much fruitiness. Very clean barley/grain flavors and decent earthy hop presence/balance.

The taste is semisweet malt and then a semisweet aftertaste that hangs out for a minute. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, very carbonated and dry. Overall, good. I'm surprised, I expected this to be terrible even though it used to be my favorite. This is a good AAL. No off flavors or defects to my taste.","  rDev Gold in color with brilliant clarity.

A dense creamy beige head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a very sturdy surface layer that sticks around through the sampling. Aroma on this one features some toffee and brown sugar and a bit of tart cherry note. Almost a little funky too, but no hop notes and the abv is well hidden at this point. First sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly, yet soft carbonation. The beer feels a little slick, I expected and remembered more of a sticky feel, but its what Ive got right now. Flavor is some brief brown sugar and a bit of dark fruit, raisins mostly. This rolls to some faint tart cherry notes and a little bit of a black peppery bite, which I attribute to the ABV.

Haven't had this in years... but how did I manage to avoid reviewing it a decade a ago? 750mL cork-and-cage topped bottle served in a Chimay chalice. Beer is deeply hued brown and forms a thick chestnut head which gradually falls. Aroma is intruiging with cherry, oak, and the distinct twang of Belgian yeast.  Flavor has an immediate fruity taste of kriek. Sweet red cherries, but also raisins and brown sugar. Complimented exquisitely by dark malt flavors, bread and treacle. The mouthfeel is outstanding, smooth and weighty, punched up more by the allspice and clove spicy flavors than carbonation.  Out of all of Ommegang's mainstay beers, I'm probably most likely to pass over this one because I'm so rarely in the mood for a cherry beer. But that doesn't detract one bit from how delicious it is.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV is 9.8%. Hazy dark brown colour, moderate off-white head with an orangey hue.

Deep and dark amber - light brown color with a ton of sediment as I drained the entire bottle into my glass. Khaki colored head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer and a thicker ring of foam around the edge of the glass. A small amount of visible carbonation.   Smell: Estery yeast Aromas of pear, raisins and apple. Some rotten fruit too. Dark bread.   Taste: On the tip of the tongue you get sweet some sweet sugary notes that carry through to the middle. The fruits are similar to the aroma, but getting more of the raisin and some light fog flavor. The sweet fruitiness has a little bit of a caramel apple thing going on. The yeast contributes greatly to the flavor. Some overly ripened banana. A touch of woody bitterness in the middle and on the finish. I think there are some cherry notes but they really come through as something like a brandied cherry. Nothing about this beer says kriek, if that’s what you’re looking.   Feel: Medium bodied, semi dry, prickly carbonation. The 9.7% ABV warms the palate perfectly.   Overall: A classic beer. And a great introductory beer for someone new to Belgian style beers. It’s not the most complex of Belgian style beers, but it’s really good. It’s also priced well compare to imports.","  rDev For some reason I kind of came into this beer with different ideas than what it is. Once I read the words “cherries” and “Kriek,” well, I was thinking exactly that. Something more sour and tart. Which is completely the opposite here. I mean, it’d be like if Kim K made a Tinder profile back when she was blonde and not as thick. Then when you show up... wowzer! What a difference. I mean, both versions are worthy, but they just ain’t the same, ya feel me? And right here, we have an almost straight up Belgian Quad with hints of Kriek. It is straight up huge, yet composed like a sailor during a sobriety test. We are talking smooth. It’s super rich, but very earthy. It has some dark fruits, and maybe just a touch of cherry. It’s so beautiful that I would actually put a ring on it (even if it came with a lil soldier from a prior relationship). Think about that. I am willing to “step daddy” this beer.  Yep!","  rDev From notes 12/18/11: Pours a hazy prune juice color producing 1.5 inches of tightly bubbled, very short-lived, light tan head that leaves little lace.

Undated other than “2017” as part of the front label design. On shelf at point of sale. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 57 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Appearance – 3.5. First pour – Amber, slight haze. Body – Muddy medium brown. When held to the light, a definite reddish cast is noted. Head – Large (Maximum 7.2 cm, aggressive center pour), tannish, initially medium density but quickly becomes fizzy and opens into low density froth, short retention, diminishing to a three to four mm crown and a thin partial cap. Lacing – None. Aroma – 3 – Begins on a strong sour note but this quickly fades to nothing. No fruit, no yeast, no malt, no phenolics, no alcohol. In fact, after the initial burst of sourness, this settles into a barely detectable generic sweetness.  Flavor – 3.25 – Distinct notes of cherry cough syrup. No alcohol taste or aroma (9.7% ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. The alcohol does produce a slight gastric warming. The general maltiness and dark fruit/phenolic/yeasty hints of most quads are absent. Palate – 3.25 – Full, approaching syrupy, somewhat lively carbonation. It leaves my lips sticky. Impression and interpretation – 3.25 – Very slightly above average quad.","  rDev Poured into a pint glass. A hazy copper-red hue with a modest tan head that hung around for a while. Cherries, caramel, and plum on the nose. The Kriek was most prominent on the palate. Cherries and a slight funk at first, but it then blended nicely with a mellow caramel and toffee quad base. I was left with the impression of a liquid Tootsie cherry pop. Not a bad thing.","  rDev A - Pours a murky brown with a large foamy tan head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.  S - Aroma is brown sugar, toffee, dates and dark cherries.  T - The taste is brown sugar, caramel, molasses, dark cherries, prune, raisins and figs.  M - Medium body with medium carbonation.

Flavor is warming and boozy, with a good presence of hot caramel, dark cherry, fig, prune, raisin, nuts, and brown bread. A lot going on, but not really a focus on any one or two things.   Feel is a bit overcarbonated than I'd like for a Quad, with warming alcohol and a hot but not particularly drying finish.   Overall, a good but not great Quad. I'd like to see this barrel aged.","  rDev Unknown vintage (date smudged); drank 9/9/18 @ the Yarchives.   Cloudy orange/red rust appearance.

Good, not great.","  rDev The Liefmans Kriek and the Belgian Quad blend produces quite a bold and interesting beer. Color is brown with dark red tinges, especially along the extreme edges.

Cherry, alcohol, yeast are players and this is a fine yeasty and bready example of a quad. Finish is slightly sweet and has touches of banana and cherry","  rDev Fairly good beer but for its reputation and name I was expecting more. Nice amber-brown color with some nice head and lingering lacing. Smells of sweet dark fruit. Tastes of ripe fruit, caramel, malt, grain and that yeast so indicative of this style.

Alcohol taste is well-hidden though.","  rDev 750mL corked bottle 2015 vintage poured into a Chimay chalice at 55F 9.7% ABV. The beer pours bright reddish brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is ripe fruit, more cherry, and brown sugar. The taste is a wonderful mixture of barely tart cherry, caramel, dried fruit, and dark sugar. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium plus carbonation and mostly dry in the finish. There is no appreciable bitterness, but it's not cloying. Overall, excellent. This is a great beer. Recommended.","  rDev A - Hazy dark brown with orange and red highlights, short tan head fading quickly, no real lacing.  S - Strong fruit, pear and sugar, bubble gum and raisins. A bit of funk, grass and phenols.  T - Brown sugar and oversteeped tea to start, bread and honey in the center, and a trailing bitter bite in the close.  M - Moderate carbonation, slightly sticky on the tongue, but a scrubbing dry finish keeps the palate clean.  O - Delicious punchy Quad, with lots of great flavor notes, and a well-integrated whole. Superb.","  rDev Had this on 2018-03-01 in Bolingbrook, IL at The Beer Market on-tap.  Had a sample taste from Pat B. It's a brilliant beer.

A: Pours a hazy to cloudy copper color with modest clearing to an initially one inch, tan head. Retention good, minimal spotty lacing. S: Aromas of molasses, plum, spice (mostly cloves), and rum, but in a complex melange that is well blended and distinct. Maybe a little grainy at the end. T: the flavor of cloves predominates against the malty backbone. A cherry note is appreciable but subtle and nice. Bitterness present and a nice counterpoint to the malt. M: Medium to full bodied. Very good carbonation leaving a tingling on the tongue and palate. Alcohol appreciable, but not overpower. O: Really an inviting, complex Quad. I alway have reservations about fruit additives (outside of say lambics and Berliner Weisse style beers), because I find they often impart sourness to the beer that subtracts from the experience, but here I do think it really delivered. A somewhat different take on the style, clearly, but also definitely a well designed, well crafted one. Kudos! Would certainly drink/serve/gift.","  rDev Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.

Nose of brown sugars, rich cherries, leather, dark fruit notes  of raspberry, and strong phenol alcohol. Flavors hit the perfect notes with warming cherry and brandy  notes touched with raisin and raspberry flavors that are steeped in brown sugars and finishing with a subtle flowery hop flavor mingling with leather and tobacco notes. Excellent medium body,  lightly slick warming middle, medium high lively carbonation, and a lightly tart and subtly dry finish with warming booze.

I could drink this one all night, until I pass out","  rDev 2016 vintage  Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!  Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast  Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt  A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness  It's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle","  rDev 650 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11%. Hazy reddish brown colour, moderate off-white head. Strong aroma of American hops, piney notes, also caramelized orange marmalade, some alcohol. Very hoppy flavour, medium sweet, caramel and alcohol. Bitter finish, hints of solvent.Warming mouthfeel. There’s plenty of hops in this one (surprise, surprise), but this is probably not where you go when you look for balance.","  rDev 65 cl. bottle, bought at The Situation some years ago. Served at home in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy brown colour, small head with short retention. No lacing. Boozy aroma, caramel, dried fruits,licorice, molasses, hops, pine, some citrus. Medium to full body, creamy texture, no carbonation. Dry sweet and hoppy finish, Taste of caramel, licorice, molasses, chocolate, hops, citrus. A beast of a beer.","  rDev A 22 fl. oz. bomber, bottled on 15th October 2015. Poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: A cloudy murky rusty orange brown colour with a thin orangey beige head that disappeared quickly while leaving some nice spotty lacing.  Aroma: Sweet malt, citrusy orange peel, citrus pith, caramel, orange hard candy, bourbon and dark dried fruit like raisins.  Taste: Sweet malt, caramel, toffee, light bitterness, grapefruit peel, citrus pith, dried dark fruit, bourbon, piney hops and some light spice.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with soft carbonation and a touch boozy.  Overall: A good balance between sweet, bitter and spice. While not overly boozy, it is a sipper, and a nice one at that.","  rDev 22oz bottle. 2011 dated release. Cloudy, medium amber colored body. Pinky finger width of off white, creamy head. Leaves extensive patterns of lacing. Aroma of caramel malts and bourbon barrel.  Taste is heavy with hops, along with the caramel malts. The bourbon barrel is there but not too prominent. Big piney hops. More than medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation. Some chunks come from the tail end of the bottle. Very powerful combination of the heavy hops and the caramel malts, together with the barrel treatment. Close to a lava lamp show with the descending and ascending chunks. Beautiful body color and tight, long lasting head.","  rDev I could tolerate the single (like a double), but this is so cloyingly boozy and abrasive even after eighteen months bottle aging, I don’t know if there’s anything good in there worth aging longer to find.","  rDev This is a 2016 that I've been sitting on for a year or more. Can't believe I haven't reviewed this famous bastard. Big, tight bubbled head above a dark amber body. Sticky lace already apparant. Dark druit, briny hops, and big chocolate malts in the nose.   Huge aggressive pine loaded with medicinal note takes the lead, but the balance here is supurb. Hard to believe this is eleven percent. Strong flavor, but little alcohol leakage. Not for everyday drinking, but when you want something both diabolical and well crafted...","  rDev this is a 2010 age tap pour (well-cellared). -mahogany with a thin tan head. Aroma and flavor are dominated by oak and leather. The finish is smooth, but there is a touch of alcohol heat.","  rDev 2008 bottle. Has definitely lost its umph. Would rather not rate it, but BA says I have to. Fairly oxidized. Just not the same anymore. Still better than most.","  rDev Pours a deep, dark amber coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells of caramel malt, toffee, red berries citrus and pine. Taste follows the nose, with a caramel, biscuity malt backbone and some toffee, chocolate and red berries, complemented by hoppy notes of citrus and pine. This really is an Imperial Arrogant Bastard, which really piles on the malt, without losing much of the hops. Depth of flavor seems more intense compared to normal AB, especially when it comes to the malt presence and fruitiness. Hop profile seems a little more mellow, although there still is considerate piney bitterness (this may be due to the 26 months old bottle). The higher ABV is noticeable as a slight, warming presence, but there really is no unpleasant boozyness to this at all. What really needs to be highlighted compared to normal AB is the thick, smooth mouthfeel, which is absolutely sublime.  Having a 2016 (3+ years old) bottle of this right now, which I'm not enjoying at all, this is not the same beer I remember, with the bitter, resinous hops almost completely gone and overshadowed by an intense sweetness and solvent-like character in the aftertaste, which may be due to oxidation. I've heard people say that this ages beautifully, which may be the case if you're into Barleywines, which this has basically turned into, but I couldn't finish the bottle. This may also be due to poor storage at the shop where I bought this though. I'd still advise caution cellaring this extensively unless you really like Barleywines.","  2015 2 years aged. Nice old Ale/barleywine. A touch harsh/bitter in finish but smoother that regular AB.","  rDev This is the 2013 release, which I've been sitting on for a while. A 22oz bottle with a bottling date of Aug 2013. ABV is stated as 11.2%. Acquired from the Brewdog webshop ages ago and carefully stored.  A: Poured into a tulip. Bottle conditioned. A deep ruby-red hue with light carbonation and some floating sediment. Yields a decent head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a minute or two before collapsing to a patchy surface layer.  S: Aroma of sweet caramel malt and pungent hops, with notes of toffee, barley sugar, grain, pine resin, spicy hops, sherry, oxidation and booze. Complex, but definitely gives off an impression of being past its best.  T: Tastes of sweet malt and exceptionally bitter hops. Hints of caramel, sugar, grain, leafy bitterness, pine resin, spice, mild sherry and a warming touch of alcohol in the rear. Quite oxidised, and lacks much of the aromatic hop character that might be expected. A forceful flavourfest nonetheless.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with hop oils and booze tingling the palate. Carbonation lightly tickles the tongue. A big, chewy texture followed by an aftertaste of sweet malt, stinging hop bitterness and oxidation.  O: An impressive brew, but I suspect I held on to this for a bit too long. Looks nice, while the aroma and flavour are huge blends of sweet malt, pine resin and leafy bitterness. Quite a bit of oxidation present, as well as the loss of aromatic hop notes that would have provided more balance to the malt. Good body. Interesting, but probably best sampled younger!","  rDev Had two bottles of this. Both are gone now. Review from notes. Purchased from the LCBO for $10.95 CDN per 22oz bottle.  Appearance - A bright red color, a finger of light tan head and some lacing. Also a not inconsequential amount of haze.  Smell - Big and boozy with plenty of molasses and inviting. Burnt sugar in there too. A malt bomb that doesn't shy away from hops either.  Taste - boozy and very bitter, some elements of smoke within, peat flavors and boozy finish.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and thick, chewy with good carbonation and a very dry finish.  Overall - A fine big beer that left me a little disappointed. Certainly drinks like an 11 percenter. Wouldn't turn it down, but won't go out of my way to purchase a third bottle.","  rDev Poured into a chalice: color is amber, a little hazy, tan head with an amber tint, bubbles are fine to small, presenting 1/2 inch thick and lingering with a solid top, head laces the glass sides.   Smell is sharp, might be the booziness, the smoothness and caramel flavors are hidden at first, then come through lighter than expected with moderate hoppiness.  Taste is huge malt, heavy caramel and lighter molasses, sharp alcohol, big bitterness. Definitely a doubly arrogant beer, but also one I think needs at least a few months aging to soften the bitter, boozy blow.   Mouthfeel is less sharp as it warms, moderate carbonation, smoothness starts to exude itself but the bitterness overtakes and bits the tongue.  I tend to like big, malty, hoppy, smooth brews but the double bastard seems a bit young yet for the 2016 release.","  rDev Poured from a bomber into a tulip  L: Pours a hazy dark copper color. Three fingers of foamy white head last awhile... great lacing.  S: Rich caramel malts... hops... aggression and arrogance.  T/F: Rich, malty, and assertive... caramel and dark sugars followed by some big time hop bitterness that is pretty much a kick in the jaw. Full bodied and thick. Well carbonated. Warming with the EtOH, but dangerously drinkable. Becomes more rich and full with a few fruity overtones as it comes up to room temp. Finish is sticky and bittersweet.  O: I love Arrogant Bastard... and I really love Double Bastard. Just outstanding beer, and always a treat.","  rDev 3.99 on 11/8/16  2014 vintage on 8/31/18 = 4.13","  rDev 22oz bottle poured into a globe. 2014 vintage is exactly two years old at this point.  A: Deep red-brown color with orangey hues. Fairly hazy. Cream -colored head settles shortly. Specks of lacing.  S: Loads of toasty bread crust. Chewy caramel. Deeply toasted biscuits. Scones. Big raisin and date fruit character. Hops still retain a fair amount of earthy and spicy pull, though they've subsided a bit.  T: Chewy caramel leads. Subtle hints of toffee. Aggressive toasty character. Heavily toasted crust. Scorched pizza crust. Raisin, fig, and date fruit. Hops are still pretty aggro, retaining a lot of bitterness and spicy, oily, and earthy flavor. Alcohols pick it up and spike hard toward the back end. Almost vodka-like. Oily hop finish leaves a strong trailing bitterness.  M: Big, thick, and weighty. Round and chewy in texture with a mild coating feel. Abrasive hop astringency dries things out. Medium-low carbonation.  O: This strong ale is very American Barleywine-esque, and quite aggressive. Huge, overly toasty, bitter, and boozy. Untamed and unashamed. It takes the palate a good while to get used to the beating this beer dishes out, and even then it's still a slow sipper. It's a weird sort of beer in that it's kind of too much and a part of me thinks I shouldn't like it, but yet I somehow still do enjoy it.","  rDev L: Hazy dark red color, one finger off-white head, high carbonation.  S: Fig, hops. Lovely.  T: Fig, hops, bitter, very malty. Boozy on the back end.  F: Full bodied, great carbonation feeling.  O: Great beer. Not for every day but would gladly have it again.","  rDev Big ruby and brown colors swirl, 1/2  tan head. Light tan. Aroma was lots of alcohol, unsweetened caramel and toffee malt smells, lots of chinook hop notes.  Taste is like a hefty barleywine, still tons of malt, that caramel, toffee and brown malt tones keep coming, but wave after wave of Chinook and Cascade hop drops all over it. This is one hearty sumbitch.","  rDev On tap at BC's Pizza &amp; Beer  A: Pours slightly hazy deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head that settles to a nice layer and leaves plenty of thick lacing.  S: Toasty malt, caramel toffee sweetness, kinda floral, dark fruit, and a noticeable alcohol note.  T: Dark fruit, berry, toasty bready malt, caramel toffee sweetness, spicy earthy kinda herbal hops, faint citrus, and a hint of chocolatey roasty malt on the back end.  M: Full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth. Alcohol is well hidden.  O: Pretty much nothing like it's Arrogant little brother, not that is a bad thing in any way. Big delicious beer.","  rDev On tap at Prefunk, 2013 version. Dark brown with small foamy beige head. Aroma is nutty, roast grains, some alcohol warmth plays out in the nose. Flavor is strong, sharp hop bitterness, heavy malt, tingly palate and plenty more alcohol warmth. A real winter warmer.","  Poured a hazy amber color with a small head. Retention is mild. Lacing is decent. Super bready malts, slight sweetness, bourbon. Taste is strong on bourbon, very malty, caramel, slight sweetness from brown sugar. Very smooth taste with medium to low carbonation. It is an excellent beer as expected.","  22 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2014 edition, imbibed late December, 2015.  Pours a deep ruby, opaque, with a one finger head and a good amount of soapy cling. Smells great, lots of malt and caramel, some herbal hops, some brown sugar, slight whiff of vanilla. Taste follows the nose with the malt and caramel. Some citrusy hops to go along with the the more dank, herbal ones, some brown sugar. Good amount of bitterness beginning midway, through the finish. Smooth for the ABV, well carbonated, really good body.  Great beer, have had before but first review. Not overly complex, but well blended and flavorful. Waiting a little more than a year to drink this probably dulls the hops a fair amount, but they're still kickin'. This is one everybody should try.","  rDev Drank in BeerTemple, Amsterdam on draft.  A: The body is cristalline copper with a beige head that has a minimal but beautiful retention and lots of lacing. S: The aroma is resinous and just a little bit of citrus but all of this in the smallest amount possível, very very soft. T: The taste is just like the aroma, being very soft, more resinous-y and just a touch of citrus in the end. M: The body is medium to low with a bit of harsh carbonation but the feeling JN the back of the mouth is gorgeous. O: Quite a good experience drinking this at BeerTemple. Quite a good beer from one of my favorito breweries.","  rDev Pours amber with an off white head. Spotty lacing. Smell is sweet malt, caramel, toffee, and booze. The taste is this with a hugely bitter hop finish. This is a really tasty beer that I tried years ago and didn't appreciate. I am glad I revisited it.","  rDev Pours a big slightly ruby-tinted medium amber with a thinner tan head that still leaves some nice small sticky lacing. The aroma is malty with a big blast of hops. It's hard to discern characteristics but it's blended well. The taste is much the same but just so damn good. The body is smooth and surprisingly light and easy drinking given the massive flavor and ABV.","  rDev Bomber picked up at the LCBO a few months ago; the last of four bottles from their Bastard Box. Bottled Sept 9 2015 and served slightly chilled.  Pours a clear ruby-red amber colour with visible flecks of stuff hovering throughout. One finger of creamy, off-white foam is seated at the surface, fading gradually over the next few minutes until only a wide, frothy collar and some bubbly film remains. I am getting notes of caramel, butterscotch, plum and candied orange on the nose, as well as hints of maraschino cherry, grapefruit, pine resin and some rummy, boozy sweetness.  Not bad, but the hop flavours seem to have faded a bit over the last ~5+ months, making this more of a malt-forward experience than anything else. Brown sugar and butterscotch, some nuttiness and a few hints of raisin and fig comprise the front end, with hops rounding out the back. They impart flavours of citrus and earthiness, with relentless resiny bitterness leading up to the bittersweet finish. Boozy aftertaste that blends hints of dark fruit, caramelized sugar and hoppy bitterness. Full-bodied, with light carbonation levels and a smooth, fairly soft mouthfeel. A good strong ale, though perhaps a little overrated.   Final Grade: 4.02, a very respectable A-. Double Bastard talks a big game (in an unnecessarily verbose manner) on the back label, but in all honesty it's probably my least-favourite of the Bastard Box beers. To be fair, this bottle is nearly 6 months old, and strong ales have never really been my thing, so my tempered reception may have more to do with personal biases and uncontrollable variables more than anything else. It's well-made, but I would much rather drink regular Arrogant Bastard - this one is just too sweet and boozy to land in my wheelhouse. As usual, different strokes apply for different folks, and while this ale might not be my thing, it is still definitely worth a try.","  rDev Appearance - Pours a deep copper red with two fingers of foamy tan head.  Smell - bready caramalts, toffee, brown sugar, fig, citrus and earthy hops.   Taste - Bready caramalts, toffee, and brown sugar dominate the brew. The fig, citrus and earthy hops help to finish the brew off. There is some warmth as well that comes into play with this one.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a lingering sweetness alongside a touch of bitterness from the hops. There is also a pleasant warmth from the alcohol.   Overall - Another winner from Stone. Though this beer had more of a malt presence then hop presence it was still a unique brew that displays the malts quite well."]},{"Name":"Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/313/1545/","Brewery":"Brouwerij Westvleteren (Sint-Sixtusabdij van Westvleteren)","Style":"Quadrupel (Quad)","Alcohol":10.20,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.  330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.   Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light.   Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep.   Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden.   Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right.   Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class.  ___________________________________________  Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:  Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)  330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.  Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.  Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.  This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.  (Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)","  rDev Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.  While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.","  rDev Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.  The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.  On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.  The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.  Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.  Overall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover.","  rDev Out of the bottle at Westvletern, Belgium.  It has happened: man has landed on the moon, Lindbergh flew around the world, and Raul has finally had Westvleteren 12. It feels like I have committed a crime but won’t be caught. Something unearthly is happening here… Like Shawn Kemp using a rubber or something.  I’m gone and I may not want to be found.","  rDev Usually I blind-taste beers but I've read so much about this one over the years I certainly know of it's reputation. That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer?  This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed...  L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. +10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down.  S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice. T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish. F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops. O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once... Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed!  330ml bottle BB: [xx]-01-2026 Euro16-00 Bought from [xx shop]/Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London. The xx's being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer.","  rDev (2015 vintage) I'm not a lover of the dark fruits character that tends to result in aged dark beers but that's what i got. Suffice to say, the taste was the most mellow that I've ever experienced. Like a fine wine, it did keep some of its Belgian Quad character and it was outstanding.","  rDev After waiting for many years to try this beer, it was very good but not the best quadrupel I've ever had. It has some nice dark fruit (fig, date, raisin) notes but it's surprisingly boozy. I no longer feel a need to acquire a case for aging purposes.","  rDev Big thanks to my best friend Jon Passow from A Starter and a Chaser podcast for sharing a bottle of this with me. Getting to try this certainly is a big beer milestone for me. Poured into a goblet glass, this beer pours a dark ruby color with some bright ruby/amber highlights when held up to the light. Has a just slightly off-white/tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a film layer of surface foam. Aromas of toasted, bready, caramel malts followed by dried fig, plum, yeasty esters, a hint of cocoa, a bit of leather, and hint of sweet , Red Delicious apple. Tastewise, the flavor profile is very similar, with the aforementioned toasted, caramel, bready malts along with plums, figs and just a hint of Red Delicious apple. This is followed by some Belgian Candy sugars along with a bit of yeastiness and just a hint of cocoa and leather here too. The flavor profile does change and get a bit more complex as the beer sits and warms up. Just an absolutely fantastic flavor profile. Has a smooth, fairly frothy, slightly creamy, also still somewhat crisp, medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish, and all the flavors stack around on the inside of my mouth on my palate for awhile after each sip. WOW! This is just a really excellent beer, and certainly the best beer of this style I've ever had.

Appearance: After a careful pour to leave most of the yeast in the bottle, a clear brown colour with a copper red hue and a just over one finger off white head that had great retention, but eventually settled to a very nice self replenishing cap while leaving great lacing around the glass.  Aroma: Strong fruitiness, apple, plum, dates, fig, toffee with light clove and banana notes.  Taste: Sweet, plum, dates, fig, banana bread, toffee, yeast and a touch of spice.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium to full bodied, with moderate carbonation.  Overall: I’m not a huge fan of sweetness, and this definitely leans on the sweet side, perhaps overly so for me. I prefer both Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 over this. It’s still good, and not by any means bad, but if I had to pick a special Westvleteren beer, it would definitely be a fresh bottle of the Westvleteren Blond, as that is just one of the best Belgian Pale Ale’s ever.","  rDev Brewed in January 2012, enjoyed in September 2018. 6 years old bottle : Enjoyed for a special occasion, this beer really doesn't disappoint. This quadrupel shows a very dark body with a small head.  Great aroma with dates, cocoa, figs, toffee The taste follows with an amazing balance at all time and an incredible drinkability.  Amaingly smooth, this dry to semi-dry ale shows no residual sugar which would make it a bit cloying.   Overall, this is an incredible beer. Really amazing. This is a quadrupel but almost on old ale territory. Reminds me more of Pannepot than St Bernardus Abt 12or Rochefort 10. Great great great","  rDev Finally got my hands on this legendary Trappist beer. Cap reads “Trappist Westvleteren 12, bevat / bier, gerstemout 10,2% VOL, ABDIJ ST. SIXTUS 8640 WESTVLETEREN TENMINSTE HOUDBAAR TOT : ZIE TOP 33Cl e”. Date on cap is 06.04.19.  This beer pours a beautiful burnt sienna brown, completely opaque with some noticeable sediment and continually rising carb. The head bubbles away quickly, beginning around two fingers and settling at one finger of ivory foam.  The nose is bursting with vibrant aromas of caramel, subtle molasses, and a wonderful combination of spices . Dark fruits are all over the backbone of this beer, full of dates and raisins.  Bready, fruity, caramel, and dark fruits all balance the amazing flavors in this beer. A subtle spiciness rings true throughout; I pick out anise in particular. More of those dates and raisins settle on the tongue. A boozy warmth is felt all the way down, paving the way for that undoubtedly certain next sip.  A great weight to this beer. Full mouthfeel, with a high carb that hits sharply but not unpleasantly. Slight stickiness, great warmth.","  rDev Pours a dark brown with a bit of murkiness to it. Head formation is high, fluffy, and retains exceptionally well. There is a bit of dark, grainy particles that linger at the bottom of the cup after leaving what looks like a little patch of dirt on the head. Lacing is dense enough that it looks like chocolate milk layered on the glass. Aroma is dark and rich plum, clove, and yeast. There is a teasing kiss of toffee and caramel on the nose as well. Flavor profile is rich and decadent plum, raisin, cloves, yeast, and biscuit and toffee malts. Toffee, and caramel add a bit more depth to it. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, smooth, and creamy feel. Overall, a magnificent brew. There is still a finger of khaki foam sitting a top even after this review. Aroma is maybe a touch thin when comparing with the rest of the beer, but the flavor profile carries a lot of depth while remaining balanced.   Served in a Chimay chalice from a 11.2oz bottle.","  rDev Note: This is a bottle that I have been storing for more than three years since it go out of date. Light brown reddish colour, small head with very short retention. No lace. Aroma of dates, raisins, brandy, spices, wood, some chocolate, spices Medium to full body, creamy alcoholic palate, flat carbonation. Sweet fruity finish. Taste of dried fruits: prundes, raisins, dates, chocolate, spices, pepper, fruits, wood. Exceptional, one of te best, like his sister 8.","  rDev 11.2 oz bottle poured into chalice glass.  A: Huge fizzy slightly off white khaki color that makes the beer almost hard to pour, but it settles almost as quickly as it forms. Brackish brown black body with very little light escaping its murkiness.  S: Light bits of dates, figs, and clove, but also a floral hop presence like noble hops. There is a nice doughy almost banana bread like smell that permeates.   T: Lots of lovely date, fig, caramel raisin taste with a little burnt sugar and toffee.   M: Insanely biting high carbonation, but yet it finishes so smooth it's unreal.  O: This is a world class beer no doubt, but the carbonation is way too high and I was expecting the depth of flavor to be more nuanced. That being said, it is really really good.","  rDev 11.2 oz. bottle with a date code of 07.12.19 on the cap  Pours cloudy opaque reddish dark brown with a dense creamy light khaki colored foam head. Smells almost like a smooth sherry wine with apples, pear, grapes, some dark fruit like plum and cherry, dried fruit, raisins, some apricot, honey, caramel, toffee, toasty bread, mild chocolate, tobacco, slight funk, a hint of spice, with floral earthy herbal grass. Tastes very complex with some of the aforementioned notes of slightly oxidized sherry wine, dark fruits, dried fruit, plum, cherry, dried figs, raisin, grapes, apple, pears, apricot, caramel, dark toffee, mild chocolate, rich roasty toasted bready malts, some tobacco, slight funk, a hint of spice, with floral earthy herbal grass. Feels medium bodied, soft and creamy with smooth moderate carbonation. Overall a real great Belgian quad.","  rDev Pours a rich dark amber color with little head and lacing.  Aroma is of fruits specifically raisins and figs, with toffee, brown sugar, and honey notes.  Taste is a thick rich complex character with fruity flavors and moderate carbonation.  A very unique beer which I had always wanted to try, and which lived up to it's reputation.","  rDev Cloudy plum brown with a small off white head.  Fig, plum, earthy hops in the nose. Fig, plum, anise, caramel and earthy bitterness in the taste, with the bitterness continuing to the after taste.  Relatively light bodied for the style with strong carbonation.  Exceptionally well crafted beer. I think I prefer the 8 a bit better though.","  rDev For years I've been hearing about the mythical and seemingly unattainable Westvleteren XII. As a result, its become one of those so called  whales  that, considering its scarcity and hefty price in the U.S., I would resign myself to having to travel directly to the monastery in Belgium. How ironic that on a leisurely family trip to Rome I came across it at Beerland Trillusa in Trastevere, Rome for the hefty but manageable price of 19 euros. My search was over! I sat down in the modest outdoor cafe overlooking the hip Trastevere Neighborhood, and as I waited for my server, I pondered if it was worth the hype. The stately plain brown bottle came out. Who needs fancy label art when this one is so elegant in its simplicity. It poured a murky mahogany brown color. An enormous tan foam head gushes up to the top in a beautifully controlled fashion. It retains seemingly for an eternity, its thick film covering the surface until the very end. As I poured it out of the bottle onto the pint glass that was handed to me, I could immediately smell the aromas of dark bread, amber malts, caramel, dark fruit and a whiff of alcohol cutting through the air with their alluring boldness, as if to say  come hither!  So many layers throughout, its difficult to do justice to all. There was also a touch of cocoa, spices, raisin, plum and grape. Towards the end there was biscuity malt. Going into the mouth was the highly anticipated moment for me. Some beers take a while for the flavors to develop. Not with this one. It's like all the nuances of bold and complex flavors burst forth as soon as they hit the tip of the tongue in a frenzy of instant gratification. If there is a smoother, more velvety and creamier brew out there, I haven't had it. In the mouth it feels like fluffy and soft floating clouds. Full bodied and gently carbonated, yet so drinkable that a few sips in I realized it was going down too fast. I'll discuss the flavors soon, except that I can't emphasize enough what an amazing texture, feel and drink ability this work of art of a beer is. As for the flavors, I do not know if there is another brew out there with such a complex array of flavors and that still manages to blend them so elegantly and smoothly. In the first phase there is a sweetness from amber malts, dark candi sugar, and soft tones of cocoa powder that add a smooth creaminess. This is complemented by a light alcohol spice that is just right and not boozy. Hard to decide what else to add as I'm sure I'm missing out on some flavor, but, here goes: dark fruit such as alcohol soaked raisins, plumps, red grape, and even a touch of lightly sour cherries. Vinous and with the feel of currants. Spicy and peppery but not overwhelmingly so, dark bread, and berries. What really did it for me is how in the middle phase there was the emergence of earthy, herbal grassy green hops that added a bold bitterness and dryness to the finish, unique in that I usually don't associate a strong hops profile with Belgian Ales.  As I finished I was in a state of both euphoria and sorrow. Euphoria at both the delicicious cornucopia of tastes and for the deceptively high ABV that provided no burn, and sorrow because it came to an end. Now for the dilemma of rating it. Was it worth the hype? Most definitely so, although the price and its status might have convinced me to wish it so. However, what is undeniable is that it is one of the most perfectly crafted, classy and elegant of all brews; it's like the Rolls Royce of brews. Is it the so called  world's best beer  as the sign at the bar said? Clearly a subjective and almost ridiculous concept, kind of like asking  what is the world's greatest piece of music, art or literature, however, I would find it hard to argue against it. Does it have flaws? I don't see any, which is why I will score it a perfect 5. P.S. On the way out I picked up a bottle of Westvleteren VIII to go. Can't wait to try it!","  rDev Beer review #3000 for me.  A - Pours a nice raisin color with amount of floaties, lacing is moderate and dense.  S - Raisins, plumb, fig, toasted toffee, slight rum aroma, very little alcohol in the nose.  T - Complex and flavorful with no flavor being dominant. Plumb, brown sugar, toasted toffee, figs, rum, raisin. Nice lingering rum and toasted toffee.  M - Big medium body, creamy carbonation.  O - This aged fantastically!!","  rDev Held this one for a year before opening. Brown appearance with two finger tan head that disipates slowly. Aroma is a a cherry or raisin type fruity that is very pleasant.

Pours a brigt amber with heavy rotation orange tining. Head is thin but steady. Nose is wood and mint and vanila.   This is velvety in texture right off the bat, and while the flavors are rich and luxurious, they are also, for the style, subtle as hell. The primary flavors are caramel malt doused in oak and vanilla with peppermint, dark fruit, and black pepper in reserve. The texture is thick in the sip but there are very few other signs of high abv. This is an exquisite rarity. I am generally not a huge DFH fan and find them talented but inconsistent and overpriced. This is delicious and unique. Well done.","  rDev It has been an interesting couple/few days. I somehow got on a DFH Bottle kick &amp; just decided to keep it going until I was completely finished with them. I had picked up a couple at Sliantra &amp; then a trip to Subs &amp; Six Packs netted me some more &amp; soon, I was off and running (often running, like for the bus).   From the Bottle:  A wood-aged marriage of an Imperial IPA &amp; an English-style ale, this hop monster is tamed by time spent aging in oak tanks.   Jeez-O, man, I could swear that I have had this before! Well, a check of several databases reveals that I have, but never at home for a review. No time like the present, beginning with a Pop! of the cap. I really enjoy a C-Line pour since there is no telling what is going to happen. In this case, it puffed up to form just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with excellent retention. Until it suddenly exhaled and fell like a soufflé when the oven door is banged shut, that is. Wow! In its wake was some of the densest, stickiest lacing that I have seen in a while. I am going to get Sam to clean this up as it may require a jackhammer to remove &amp; I blame him for it. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = &gt; 9, &lt; 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose held notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, pineapple &amp; hemp line/rope. 8=O We used hemp line as mooring line on some ships &amp; going into the line locker, it had this kind of woody, resinous smell, but also ropy. Mouthfeel was big, thick &amp; full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue! I let it roll around like a playful puppy, really allowing the flavors to build to a crescendo. The oaky woodiness was prevalent, but the caramel &amp; vanilla flavors acted as a nice counterpart with a warming sensation from the alcohol. Tasty? You'd better believe it! Dangerously so, in fact, since it was going down like water. NOT recommended! Yowza. I also tasted a pine/hemp resinousness that I had not gotten on the nose, but at the same time, I did not taste the pineapple that I smelled. Very interesting! Finish was actually cool and bracing, like a shot of peppermint schnapps. That is imprecise. The taste was minty, but not pepperminty. More towards evergreen. Very clean, dry, literally breath-taking. It was like being in a stand of evergreens as snow falls all around and just taking a deep breath. Get the sensation? Whew. My only bugaboo was its extreme drinkability. I almost feel like taking a nap after this. Goo.","  rDev From the growler via DEPS in NKY and enjoyed in a snifter. This legend of a strong ale/IPA pours a illuminated lightly cloudy orange hazed amber with a beautiful head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin light layer, and shows some delicious lacing. Nose of sweet brown sugars, heavy grapefruit and orange zest, sweet oak, and earthy malts with herbal notes.  Flavors exceed the nose by a long shot with grapefruit, white grapes and light yellow raisins awash in herbal and citrus hops with a touch of pine amid rich honey and light brown sugar notes. Sticky, rich, earthy, and laden with oak and hints of vanilla. A  monster of an IPA. Excellent mouth feel; medium sticky body, medium light carbonation, and a rich warming citrus and rigid malt backbone finish.  Excellence from the Dogfish folk!   Cheers","  rDev L: Hazy, translucent amber with a huge creamy off white head. Very good retention, with lots of streaky lacing.  S: Oak, vanilla, pine, caramel, ruby red grapefruit, blood orange, toast, and cranberry and currant.  T: Caramel and toast upfront, and then ruby red grapefruit, blood orange, and plum--and then a massive, oak and vanilla smoothness. All of the oak flavors, but minimal tannins. Somewhat sweet, but never cloying. Dangerously drinkable.  F: Pretty full-bodied, moderately-carbonated, creamy, and rich.  O: A really delicious DIPA/old ale combo, with tons of great oak flavors.","  rDev 12oz bottled 3/28/18 (3 months ago) poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours bright orange amber in color with sticky off white head. The head recedes to an island and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is faint with caramel and oak. The taste is semisweet caramel with an earthy hop bite finished by an oaky vanilla note. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, delightful and unique. It opens up as it warms so don't rush it.","  rDev Poured from a single serve bottle...  Pours a deep copper-nearly amber, with an excellent remarkably light-colored foamy head and fantastic lacing.   The nose gives away a strong, just shy of overbearing malt backbone that is alive with dark sugar and toasted grains. The hops arrive soon thereafter, but wet, and muted. The barrels are almost an afterthought, but a pleasing one.  The malt character carries over even more strongly to the palate, with the hops arriving, but in a semi-sweet fashion. Orange rind comes to mind, with the typical citrus notes undoubtedly influenced by the barrel aging.   The feel is a bit off. Rather heavy and almost sticky (though not cloying).  Overall an interesting brew worth sampling.","  rDev Amber copper color with a thick two finger head with medium retention. Aroma with notes of caramels, mild pine, a bit of wood, toffee, orange marmalade and grapefruit. Flavor with notes of caramels, overripe pineapple, apple juice, vanilla, young wood and Cointreau liquor. Dry, boozy and bitter aftertaste. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. This felt like a hoppy and caramelly Old Ale. I would actually consider this an American Barley wine. Too much caramel for my taste, I guess hops faded over time.","  rDev Poured from a bottle dated 11/20/17 into the test glass A - Lite cedar colored, active carbonation can not hide.

The beer pours very nice orange/amber color with a light white head that disappated quickly leaving a small amount of lacing.  When I first opened the bottle I got a hit of grapefruit immediately. From the glass I'm getting lots of light malts. The hops seem a little subdued and mostly pine and citrus.   The taste is a very interesting blend of lots of flavors. There is a definite citrus hop presence up front but the malt quickly moves in through the middle. The finish balances out the malt with a lingering bitterness. In searching for the oak, I get little hints of it on the front and the finish. There is no hint of the 10% abv.  The mouthfeel smooth and slightly slick/oily with relatively low carbonation.  Overall this is a very unique beer. There is a ton going on but nothing seems to dominate other than lingering bitter finish. I'm really enjoying how easy it is to drink.","  rDev Poured out a clear amber color with orange highlights. It smelled oak, bready malt and pine. Some good oak flavors like vanilla.

I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit.

Shiny, completely opaque, and viscous. Huge khaki colored head forms with an aggressive pour. Once formed, the head slowly begins to collapse until a thin layer of foam remains on top of the beer. Lots of tan lacing remains on the glass.   CBS has notes of coffee, roasted malts, a touch of pine, with notes of oak, bourbon, smoke and a sweet tantalizing hint of maple coming through. Balanced is what comes mind to describe this aroma.  CBS has some nice roasted malts up front, bourbon, oak, a touch of pine and lots of coffee come through up front.

CBS is a beer that is remarkably good, but I think that these days it does not get the credit or accolades that it once did in large part due to what I think its is greatest  virtue  - balance. Its got barrel aging, coffee, maple, but it lets each component shine without outshining any of the others.","  rDev 2019 release. 12oz bottled 10/9/19, opened 11/22/20. 2 finger mocha colored head, fine bead and dense with a frothy crop of bubbles on the top (like freshly stirred chocolate milk). Excellent retention and full lacing. Black Imperial Stout all the way down...no brown edges.  Beautiful looking barrel aged beer. All advertised components come through in the nose, coffee, bourbon, chocolate/cocoa, maple, barrel, and deep roasted malt. Big aroma but seems very well integrated, not boozy.  Rich chocolate and roasted malt first. Bourbon and maple second. Smooth coffee flavor late.  This is about as well balanced as a beer this big and with as many bold ingredients could be.  The maple amplifies as the beer warms and the chocolate becomes more prevalent (dark/bitter). Full body, smooth mouthfeel with a rich and lengthy finish that never seems too much (not too sweet, not too boozy, etc...). Lingers on and on and on. Paying $26.99 for a 4pk made me grouchy but sitting here with this beer on a Sunday morning and $6.75 per bottle seems fair for this treat. World Class.","  rDev Tasted in a snifter from draft at Consume on December 19, 2017.","  rDev 23/07/2021   Drank again. very little difference except some tobacco notes on the taste  25/07/2020 - A beer that I have been wanting to try for so very long. 2018 version  A – Pours the classic thick dark oily engine oil colour. The head is thin bubbled and creamy which retains well and laces S – Big earthy aromas of woody oak and spirit bourbon with a slightly vanilla end T – Oh my the Maple is very well pronounced with a nice bourbon oaked vanilla finish. So well balanced it is quite unbelievable. This one goes into my Hall of Fame M – Full body and low carbonation, as you would expect.  O – An absolute monster stout that hides its overtness with balance. The craft in this beer is seriously impressive and if you can find it, buy it.","  rDev Picked up while wandering around in Salem, MA  A: Pours your typical stout obsidian--this one is particularly deep with no light visible through it. Dark as night. The head formed well on the finish of the pour, more 'fizzy' in appearance than frothy, and ringed with a deeper hue than the sandy color of the rest. Some lattice has already appeared on the glass as it recedes.   S: Big chocolate and vanilla notes up front with coffee following. The latter has a taste not unlike something you might pick up from Starbucks or the like--a sweet, espresso-based drink.   T: While I did not pick up on maple first in the nose, it seems like the first thing noticed in the flavor. There's no real hiding the spiciness of alcohol. The chocolate and coffee almost seem to blend together as  one flavour.    M + O: The body wasn't as full as I may have expected after seeing it. Nonetheless, the body is there and it leaves a bit of a coating on the palate that allows for ongoing enjoyment after swallow. An excellent stout!","  Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter  A: Pours nearly black with a creamy chocolate brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves some gorgeous lacing.   S: Rich, chocolate, smooth coffee and bourbon, maple, spice, vanilla, earthy faintly herbal notes, light char, dark sugar, and a touch of oak.   T: Decadent, dark and milk chocolate, coffee, and maple all make their presence known, smooth bourbon, a bit of spice, vanilla, roasty, a little earthy and nutty, extra dark sugar, and hints of oak, molasses, and light char.   M: Full body, soft carbonation, creamy smooth. Just a touch of warmth, but otherwise the alcohol is nearly completely hidden.   O: Been saving this one for a special occasion, glad today was that day. It's pretty much everything I could ask for in a big desert stout. Sure, they could probably dial the maple back a half a notch as it can get a bit sweet, but overall it's a damn good sipper.","  rDev Walnut black under a short-lived ed head, good lacing. Sweet, boozy, grainy nose. Appetizing. Syrupy mouthfeel, which is probably the least attractive Thu g about this brew, but with a bit of sparkle or bite to it. Tasty, but super sweet. Many delicious things bappening, cbocolate, vanilla, maple, coffee, malt. Interesting, but potentially overwhelming. Sippin' beer. Go slow.","  rDev A: opaque; very dark brown in color; 1+ finger dark brown head that receded to a splotchy cap; nice lacing;  S: vanilla first, then coffee;  T: complex flavors; a balance between vanilla and chocolate through the middle; then maple gets added in; mild to moderate bitterness on the finish;  M: full bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish;  O: a pleasure to drink;","  rDev -brewed with chocolate and coffee. Aged in Maple syrup Bourbon barrels.   A: Bready textured head is a dark saddle brown coloring at one half inch statue with a moderate rate of stability. Dark syrupy coffee exits the bottle on the pour, rich and viscose by sight, lovely, leaving a temporary thin milky covering atop.   S: Big thick chocolate malt richness is first to hit the nose, somewhere between a triple chocolate forest cake and Hersey syrup. Heavy molasses brings a sweetness, pancake syrup, along with hints of bacon highlights. Sweet fudge and a light watery bourbon touch combines with some buttery caramel sweetness to strike the perfect balance. A fresh roastiness of oily beans and smoked wood gentle linger in the background.   T: Flavor was thick and syrupy, roasted chocolate and oily coffee beans combine with the molasses to bring a knockout but balanced punch from the start. Roasty with some smoked wood and caramel there is some cocoa powder, bacon and bourbon all mixing well together. Vanilla caramel creamer and butterscotch hints that finish with a eloquent and smooth chocolate cofffee roastness that is exceptionally smooth and delightful. Hints of silky ash and bitterness bring delight as well.   M: Thick and syrupy mouthful does not disappoint with a smooth and creamy fullness and feel. Roasty ash and bourbon warmth.   O: Overall a perfect balance and sweetness hides this monster abv% into a session like drinking experience. So smooth and eloquent, a perfect flavor and drink-ability that seems like a steal at $7 for a 12oz. What I wouldn't do for a sixtel.","  rDev Finally get to crack this legendary beer as a present to myself for turning 35 today. Kind of crazy to think in just a couple months I would be with BA for 11 years! Into a pint glass it was thick viscous and downright velvety but a slow pour only made for a 1/4 inch of froth that settles to a thin ring. Maybe I should have poured harder? Smell isn't in your face maple or bourbon but it is there and shine brightly almost overtaking any chocolate aroma. Taste was crazy thought it was going to be straight up maple but it hit chocolate with a duet of maple and bourbon mixed flavors that made me say  Woah!  Maple does become a bit stronger in the front end (If that's possible) once it warms a tad. Body to me is thick don't get me wrong still smooth as ever but I really should have had it with food since it hit me hard.   Overall this beer was made to be sweet and damn it is ever tasty! Quite a shame they will take a break with this one but to me this was better than KBS Espresso and well worth the wait to smaller format. If ever bottled again I would grab a four pack and have it on a couple occasions to savor it!","  rDev Tasted on tap at the Yard House, Summerlin in Las Vegas, NV. Great stout appearance with massive head. Luscious aromas with maple and heavy bourbon. Flavors a bit blown out by the strong bourbon heat, but still delicious.","  rDev L: Jet black color, no head or lacing to speak of, no visible carbonation.  S: Chocolate, sweet. Nice and subtle.  T: Chocolate, sweet, maple, alcohol. Delicious!  F: Full bodied, tons of flavor.  O: World class imperial stout on the sweet side.","  Review from notes. 2011 vintage bottle. Roasted malt, maple syrup, oak barrel, and espresso. Some vanilla, dark chocolate, and biscotti. Hints of brown sugar and smoke as well. Taste mostly follows + pronounced sweetness. Smooth, velvety, full-bodied mouthfeel, rich chocolaty sweet middle, roasty bittersweet finish with some warmth going down. One of the best imperial stouts I've ever consumed.","  rDev L:.

F- rich good var, but strangely came off thin on tap. O - not a perfect beer for its style but solid. Just a bit too sweet for me. Secondary aspects fade quickly","  rDev I might consider not rating AIS any more. (RIS for the same reason.) And that reason is because I rate substantially below the average. I don't consider myself to be a square peg in a round hole. (But, I will concede that I might be.) Part of my problem is I don't get effusive about getting bonked on the head by a stout that is a substitute for dessert.  I now have rated 8 of the Top Ten AIS by number of BA ratings. Not one did I rate above the average and three were substantially below ( .5 below the average.) And I like the style and think that most of the Top Ten are great beers. So to let BA raters be BA raters, I'm think it is best I retire from rating this style... and just enjoy it.","  rDev 12 oz. bottle poured into snifter (bottled on 9/23/19)  L: pours out like black motor oil, thick and syrupy with a slow-developing head of thick head of tan foam at least an inch tall; keeps a full collar of tan/brown foam; light sticking off the head, minimal lacing  S: licorice, raisins, raisin bread, maple syrup, vanilla milkshake, molasses, brown sugar  T: dark notes reign — raisins, dates, prunes, molasses, burnt brown sugar, licorice, espresso; not a ton of maple syrup flavor, but there's so much sweetness in it that it sometimes has hints of maple syrup; generally hard to distinguish the bourbon barrel notes, but as the beer warms a bit more bourbon flavor enters, including vanilla; the first couple of sips are hot from the alcohol, but that disappears pretty quickly; lots of either burnt-malt bitterness or hop bitterness — the IBUs are rated at 45, which suggests the malt should overtake the hops relatively easily; as the beer warms and the palate adjusts, that burnt-malt/char-wood bitterness begins to disappear, and left over is milk chocolate/vanilla shake sweetness with hints of maple and bourbon, including cherry-vanilla bourbon notes  F: thick and soft with a light layer of crispness mid- and late-swallow; I gave it a pretty hard pour and robbed it of plenty of carbonation, but there's still enough to help lighten the thickness of the liquid  O: it's quite the show and very tasty; it's hard for me to distinguish from KBS and it seems a bit  darker  with less from the maple syrup than I expected; very good, but I think in the end I probably prefer the base Breakfast Stout or the base Sumatra Mountain for a big stout experience from Founders; this one's so sugary and full of so many notes that they seem to be battling and mixing up and a bit muddled; I might hold onto my other three bottles from the four-pack for next winter and see what a little age does to them","  rDev Only underwhelming aspect was the nose that kinda fell flat. Taste was brilliant as no one aspect dominated; maple supplied a rich and deep sweetness while there's just enough coffee, nougat and alcohol to make a well balanced taste overall. Silky feel and dry, slightly hot finish and just a little sticky sweetness remains","  rDev First time having this since one of my first EBFs. Pours opaque, jet black in color with one third inch head. Taste is big dark roasted coffee and luscious maple syrup. There is some barrel taste coming through as it warms. Heavy bodied, sweet, rich, roasty with low carbonation. Why did I pass this by for so long. Amazing beer that gets a lot better as it warms. Will need to get more bottles of this.","  rDev Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is good.   Smell: Strong aromas of chocolate and coffee. There are some roasty elements and even a touch of burnt elements in the background. There are faint hints of bourbon and maple syrup as well.   Taste: Chocolate and coffee and the dominant flavors with maple syrup and bourbon not far behind. There are also some low dark fruits and a touch of burnt roasted malts.   Feel: It has a full body that is on the border of being chewy with strong alcohol warming.   Overall, a fantastic combination of stouts, maple syrup and bourdon with touches of other elements.","  rDev Let me start off by saying I love Founders but have notoriously found FBS and especially KBS highly overrated.  Body is dark and sticky with latee colored head that fades almost completely immediately.   Nose is very nice with coffee, toffee, maple, bourbon and a very nice complexity  Flavor is similar to the nose but bitter coffee comes through more. There is still oak barrel, vanilla, maple and hints of coffee upfront. The finish is a lot of bitter coffee and alcohol heat.  Feel is good smooth, relatively heavy and rich, sticky with low to medium carbonation  Overall this brew is good and pretty much exactly what I expected. A better, more complicated KBS. This is a great beer overall and I would be happy to have it again but it doesn't make my top stouts of all time list.","  rDev Bottled 10/16/18, about 14 months on this as for the review. So happy to try this one. 750 mL bottle while watching the My Chemical Romance reunion livestream, what a night :)  Pours black as night, with two fingers of a thick, mocha head, incredible lacing. Bottle is beautiful as well  Mmmmm, a solid bourbon smell right up front, aromas pretty similar to KBS overall but more nuanced. The dark malts and bitter coffee give off sweet toffee aromas, not too much maple in the nose  Well damn, this one tastes smooth. Very similar to the nose but toned down. I expected a total taste bud assault, but things are well balanced here. Sweeter than expected, the maple comes in at the back end of the sip to smooth out any bitterness. The coffee character is absolutely stellar with dark chocolate notes supporting it. The barrel gives off wonderful vanilla and nutty notes  Like I said, extremely smooth feel without being too heavy or even too sweet like some have said. There's definitely presence in the body, but it's not overwhelming. A surprising amount of carbonation too  I feel extremely lucky to get to try this, found it at my local and thought I just had to buy it to celebrate the end of a tough semester. Everyone deserves to try this, what I'll consider one of my all time favorite stouts, at least once. I sure as hell hope to have more of this eventually. Veryyyyyyy easy drinking for the 11.6% of this vintage, will kill off this 750 mL for sure. Cheers to Founders, and especially to MCR for making this night extra special for this former emo kid :)  EDIT 10/24/21: Having another one of these bottled 10/9/21, so just about 2 years later. I just wanted to check in on this one since it’s been my #1 since I originally reviewed it. It honestly is still drinking wonderfully, plenty of coffee and maple in the aroma. Less maple in taste but it’s all still super smooth, really nothing new added but it’s a bit more mellow. My conclusion? I still love this beer. Hoping they bring it back soon","  rDev Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. The beer pours a solid dark cola brown color with a dense creamy tan head of 1cm that foams up abut 1.5 cm and fades to a clingy edge layer and small surface island. The aroma is rich with maple syrup sweet chocolate and a bit of bourbon mixing with some sweetened coffee. Overall fairly sweet scented nose, with no hop character nor any hint of the elevated booze in this beer.  The first sip reveals a silky smooth textured brew with very fine and slightly tingly carbonation that rolls across my palate. The physical traits on this beer are very nice and make this a super easy drinking beer for the size and ABV in the glass. Flavor is rich and malty with a lot of chocolate and again, sweetened coffee. Some toffee and bourbon hits in the middle with a bit of maple syrup that lingers after each swallow. I also dont get any hops here and the ABV is still amazingly well hidden.  Im really enjoying this beer and the flavors and booze that it brings. Glad to have brought some home this week. Also glad it is in a 12 oz format now and not just the 22 oz bottle.","  rDev *Although sampled previously, this is my first review*  Bottled on 10/3/19  Pours a slick black body with deep mahogany accents as it fills the glass and is capped with a tight, creamy 1.5 fingers of dark khaki head; solid retention yields a thick ring of froth and some sparse island of cap, while a substantial walling of thin, soapy lacing holds steadily around the glass.  Aroma a brilliant tandem of roasty malts and smooth espresso interwoven as a fresh, vibrant introduction to deeper milk chocolate, vanilla and oak undertones; developing maple, further toasted oak, hazelnut, and a touches of bourbon show additional complexity and roundedness on the back end.  Taste profile accentuates milk chocolate alongside a prominent background of charry maple-soaked bourbon barrel upfront, maintaining consistent influence around the roasty coffee, flaky malts, and dark chocolate tones to come.  Mouthfeel features a semi-slick medium body as a mild carbonation sits in the backdrop; soft, roasty grit shows character along the mid-palate and into a semi-sweet and drying finish with no detectable alcohol presence.  While this one didn't quite live up to the memory of my first sampling almost 2 years ago, it was never quite far off, with the flow of vibrant coffee and subtle maple still some of the best I've ever encountered in a brew; essentially, a superior example of maple integration without the loss of its stout base (and never verging into pastry territory). This balance, along with the bursts of casual intensity, are consistent, notable, and ultimately still top-tier for the style.","  rDev 2019-11-30 22oz bottle served in a pair of WABL sample glasses. I think it says it was bottled on 10.02.18. Label has a riderless horse on it instead of the normal mountie.  Pours black, thick, faint hints of reddish around the edges, with a moderate head and a fairly significant amount of carbonation. Smell is rich, coffee, chocolate, roastiness. Sweet, not as boozy as I remember.  Taste is rich chocolate and coffee, a bit of boozy sweetness. Maple is there, but not very pronounced.  Mouthfeel is thick, rich, but not sticky. Overall, really good beer.","  rDev Pours a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied.

This beer is amazing...thick and dark. Solid black with a dense tan head. The aroma is a boozy, coffee and maple sugar scent. Thick and sweet with lots of bitterness. Wonderfully intense. This would be excellent during a winter blizzard and hockey game.","  rDev 2019 vintage. Bottled on 9/16/19. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours black with a fluffy dark khaki head that falls leaving nice bubbly retention and nice lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Some cocoa and chocolate. Some caramel. Subtle bourbon notes. The flavors are bolder than the nose. The maple syrup shines without dominating. Lots of milk chocolate along with some dark chocolate. More caramel along with some hints of vanilla. The coffee is subtle and balanced, but comes through. The bourbon blends well and accentuates everything that's going on. Moderate to low bitterness. There's a nice sweetness to this one, but it's not cloying or over the top. Nice malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is ultimately well hidden. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, smooth and dangerously drinkable.   This is a really nice barrel-aged brew. Balance is the key with this one. The maple syrup, bourbon, chocolate and coffee all blend well together. This is my first time having CBS, so I can't compare it to previous vintages. It's definitely not my new personal favorite barrel-aged stout that I've had, but it's still great stuff. No complaints here.","  rDev 2019 edition. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Nearly black pour with a good finger+ of tannish head. Great lacing.  S: Sweets, roast, and booze.  T.F: Maple sugar and sweet sugars to start. Chocolate, light espresso, and roast. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Creamy and super smooth. ABV dangerously hidden... super drinkable. Medium bodied... complex finish with all of the above flavors coming back out to play.  O: A world-class barrel-aged beer. The maple syrup is subtle but present and it all melds together to make a heavenly beer.

I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.  When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness.  The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness.  The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish.  This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!","  rDev Pours a dark nutty brown with mild fog. Head is a finger and a half of tan foam that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is cherry, Pinot noir, with a earthy, bready malts and stone and cellar notes.

I drank one fresh and the other after cellaring for 3 years.  Ruby brown color with a small off-white head. Good clarity. Aroma hits you with a strong funkiness up front and a wave of sour cherries. Taste is tart and acidic but it really mellows and smooths out as you drink your way through the beer. A little oak in the background as well. Medium bodied with lively carbonation.  I remember enjoying it more fresh than aged. There is probably a sweet spot of around one year of aging for this. It isn't the most complex beer as far as flavors go, but it wouldn't be my pick to introduce someone to sour/wild ales either.

Granted I am far from a sour expert and not very good at describing beers like this, but this one is excellent. Pours a nice ruby-brown. The aroma and flavor are finely layered, complex, ebbing and flowing. A yin and yang of huge barny funk complete with gloves, dirt, tack room, muddy, bruised medicinal herbs, etc. balanced with an equally assertive sour cherry, red-wine tanninic, oaky, funky medley with macerated berry bushes (dirt, roots, leaves and all). It is very drinkable for as tart as it is (for my tastes at least) and has the subtle, near-constant, tongue-corner-mouth-watering-tickle-thing going on that makes beers like this a non-stop experience when drinking them, as its residue lingers and evolves in your mouth between sips. Very nice! (4.75)","  rDev 375ml bottle, that was bottled on '012518'. ABV% is labeled as 7.75%. Cloudy, medium amber colored body. Partial finger of off white head upon pouring, which quickly retreats to a partial cap and bubble fed ring. Leaves behind a few scattered spots of lacing. At slight distance, the aroma of oak and funk waft into the nose. Upon closer examination, the sour cherry is smelled. Quite a wonderful aroma blend with the leather/horse blanket funk. Taste is sour, with lemon, sour cherry, and Pinot Noir wine. The oak and funk join in. Funk is tobacco, leather, and horse blanket. The finish is very dry. Medium body with a dense texture. Very good carbonation.

It has a very fragrant smell of ripe cherry, oak, red wine, and brett yeast. The taste is complex: tart cherry, pinot noir, oak, and a crackery malt at the finish. The flavors are all bold but they blend very well and there is a surprising balance of sweet and sour. It finishes with a touch of bitterness. This ale is a nice, full body with lively carbonation, and it's easily drinkable at 7.75% ABV.

Cherry menthol and port--like warming alcohol without a burn. add in some nut flavours as well. But There is a complexity to this I haven't had before in any sour. The port notes and the smooth mouthfeel are soooo different.","  rDev Pours a dark reddish brown with a quickly receding off white head. Nose is tart sour cherry. Taste follows with a definite red wine influence. Definitely the 2nd best wild ale I've tasted next to RR Consecration.","  rDev Served from a bottle into a flute at Toronado Bar in San Francisco; produced in 2018 A: Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights and an off white head, displaying moderate retention and solid lacing.  S: Tart with aromas of cherries, pinot noir grapes, and vanilla. Lacto clearly present.  T: Tangy with flavors following the aromas fairly closely. Earthier, woodier, with an ?old leather note.  M: Substantive mouthfeel. Full bodied with beautifully persistent effervescence. O: Despite consuming this very early, it presented very complex and mature flavor characteristics. Would love to be able to get this back home.","  rDev Look: It pours brown with a slightly off white head. Head retention is moderately good.   Smell: The first impression is a winy, sour aroma. It is followed by cherries and leather. There is also a bit of a barnyard impression.   Taste: There are flavors of cherries and leather with a moderate vinous quality. There are some wood like qualities to it. There are low levels of malt in the background. It has a very faint hint of smoke.   Feel: It has a moderately feel with some pleasant alcohol warming. It is quite sour to start, but does manage of dry finish.   Overall, it is quite complex in the nose and in the flavor with plenty of sour and brett qualities with the wine qualities. It work well together.","  rDev Taster at brewery. And I thought Consecration was the bomb. Wow! Not a sour guy, but this could turn me. Deep golden hue, soft foamy head. Aroma is soft and fruity. Taste brings the Brett, gently. Sweet and tart, like the candy. Hits it on all levels.","  rDev This was on tap at Apex and was a 2011 batch, served in a little flute-like glass. Poured a beautiful clear brownish red, no head whatsoever. Nose: fairly vinous, sour and fleshy cherries, a little vanilla, and here's something interesting, a bit of balsamic vinegar there, too. That's an interesting mix of flavors...and they carry through for its taste more or less exactly. Maybe a little more orchard fruit. The feel: carbonation is on the low side, body is middling, flavors are full and well-developed, but I'm not nearly as wowed as I was expecting to be, based on reputation and how much I've enjoyed other beers from these guys. For one thing, flavors just aren't very bright...it is pretty mellow. And the funk wasn't as funky as I thought it should be. I wonder if 7 years is a little too long for this one to sit. Hopefully I'll get a chance to try a younger one before too long.","  rDev Reddish appearance with thin white head. Definite sour aroma with the cherry and Pinot accent. Taste is sour but not too sour, dry but not too dry and a definite cherry and Pinot accent.","  rDev A total wow beer. Only got a little pour but it's amazing. Cloudy brownish orange color. Smell is tart bubble gum and cherry with a wine background. Taste is tart cherry and gentle wine barrel flavors. Dry finish, flavorful, fruity, absolutely amazing.","  rDev WOW. This beer is absolutely incredible. Poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 02/23/2016, 7.75% ABV. 12.68 oz bottle.  Look: Pours an opaque burnt crimson color, no head, quickly dissipating lace. Smell: Dominated by oak and white grape, tart cherries, and peach. The woodiness is an amazing afterthought that is so crucial to the balance of aromas. The yeast even give it a slight hint of mold and grain. Taste: So much going on here. Very tart, but with such strong notes of Pinot grapes. The subtle acidity finishes with strong oak barrel influences and a very subtle smokiness in the finish. Fruit notes of tart cherry and peach again evident in the taste. Feel: Very dry body, seltzery and medium bodied. Although it has sweet characteristics, it is definitely a lip smacker.  An amazing experience. I've never had a sour so positively influenced by its containing barrel. You get notes of all the right things, and the yeast adds just enough chaos of funky tartness to perfect this beer's amazing profile. Get this bad boy while you can.  UPDATE: Still an amazing brew, but after having multiple different batches and many other similar sours, just amending the numbers a bit (2/23/18).","  rDev Bottled on 12.17.12.  Probably the oldest beer I've had (that I've been aware of anyway).  Tea brown in color with a slight fizziness. The aroma is almost boundless and full of funky notes of over ripened peach, white grape and plum with a base of spent grain, and damp straw. Tastes vinous with a nice mix of sweet and tart up front followed by more smooth, long tartness to finish. Has a medium tartness all the way through while notes of grain and wheat mingle with a touch of white grape juice, peach pith, cherry, other fruit peel and faint wood. Body is medium and goes down super dry.   Never overbearing, but never boring either. This one knows right where it needs to be, and for that reason it enjoys its place among the elites.","  rDev Bottle dated 09/2016: Review is on both a slightly heavy pour that didn't decant the beer as well as possible, with notes on a shared one that was  Pours a very clear amber brown until the bottle is tipped a little too far. A properly decanted beer holds its off-white head a little better. Visible but limited streams of tinny bubbles eventually can't hold the impression, and the beer ends up mostly devoid of head.  The nose is classic upon initial impression - which comes quite quickly after the cork releases with a loud pop. There seems to be a fairly even balance of cherry tartness, red wine grape, and barrel woodiness.  The first sip hits me with more sour punch than I expected from the nose. Once that is accounted for, the beer  mellows  a tad, though it is still decently sour - which does take this to the next level over the Flanders styles that came from the nose. Despite limited exposure to my sight, the carbonation is definitely sensed via feel. It accentuates (or is accentuated by) the sour notes from the added yeast strains. This sourness has a cherry aspect to it, but overpower that flavor for the most part. The wine tannins along with the former barrel's resident come out by mid taste, more notable than the cherries. The cherries seem to make a little return in the lingering taste that otherwise has the yeast and barrel notes lingering.  The better decanted offering was a little more clean, but didn't seem to have too different a profile. There was just a little more  funk  from the beer that had a little cloud of the dregs into it.  I slowly appreciated this more as I drank it, though I had it rated fairly high initially. I really like the wine aspect of it, but wish the cherry was a little more evident on my palate. Having had Dissident last week, I feel this one is a little more sour, doesn't showcase the cherry nearly as much, but has an better feel to it. If the two weren't relatively difficult to obtain, I think it would be a fun side-by-side.","  rDev Poured into a small taster glass. A hazy rusty-brown color with a modest off-white head. The nose was full of wine notes- cherries, pinot, oak, and vanilla. Also a bit of hay and funk. The taste showed the pinot and had a distinctive wine character, but was complex with Brett, hay, bread, and funk. Really enjoyable."]},{"Name":"Double Trouble","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/34146/","Brewery":"Founders Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":9.40,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. Notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. Very bitter aftertaste.","  rDev 12 oz bottle pours a glowing amber-copper color, nice thick head, leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass. Strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma. Full bodied but carbonated , Strong citrus flavors, nice lasting bitterness, very tasty.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip.  Pours slightly hazy dark gold with excellent smooth foamy head that lingers well for the ABV and good lacing.  The aromas are more floral than pungent, with some good earthy aromas as well. Evocative of an old school over the pond IPA, rather than a piney American. But as the brew warms, pungent resins start to bloom.  The brew has a nice balance. A solid but delicate clean malt backbone offset with an ample earthy/floral hop flavor. Hints of honey, citrus, and graham in midstream. The brew finishes with growing resin and chive and some warming booze.  The mouthfeel is actually a shade beyond medium, and grows heavier as the brew warms, but the carbonation and leaning alcohol keep things in check.  Overall, a really good DIPA that combines a lot of different hop feels. Although it gets a little all over the place and unfocused as the brew warms.","  rDev One more drink before I hit the  hard stuff  for New Years...  ...and what a good choice I have made. Great looking orange-yellow brew with frothy, thick head. Great lacing all the way down the pint glass. The smell was full of citrus and the mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of decent carbonation. The taste is mostly what you will find when you take in an imperial IPA and overall, it's solid enough.","  rDev From notes 7/7/13: Pours an opaque deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, foamy, short-lived head that leaves motes and a small webby ring of lace. Aroma is grapefruit, orange and caramel malt backed by pine and melon. Taste is intense grapefruit with notes of orange, pine resin,tropical fruits, melon and caramel. Starts sweet with bitterness entering at mid-sip and becoming predominant in the finish and aggressively so in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation, creamy, silky, a little oily in the finish and slightly chewy.","  rDev Pours a cloudy copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of grapefruit and spice. Taste is sweet and boozy. Good mouth feel. Creamy, easy drinking.","  rDev Lightly hazed gold with four fingers of bone color head. Very dense lacings. Smell is malty with grapefruit hops. Taste is malt forward with good grapefruit pine slightly dank hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. The finish is dry and pretty balanced.  Overall a tasty dipa. Bottled 06/19/19. The hops have most likely faded a bit.","  rDev Very beerish looking and very slightly hazy. Good carbonation and very little head. Malt sweetness overtakes the hops. Smells great. Taste is mixed with the malt sweetness pretty much overpowering the hops. It has a hint of bitterness but overall smooth and tasty. Not boozy either. A nice Imperial India Pale Ale. Bottled 06/21/19","  rDev 6 week old bottle. Lots of balanced bitterness, nose was mute likely due to age. In days of too much average haze, I'll happily grab this when fresh.","  rDev 12 oz bottle, bottled on 6/21/19. Pours clear orange gold with a big creamy white head that retains well and laces the glass.  The aroma is subdued - sweet bready malts with a little fruit and resiny hops.  The flavor is sweet bready malts and a little fruit with a resiny hop finish. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation.  Overall, a decent DIPA.","  rDev 5 oz pour on tap. A big, boozy DIPA that comes across more like a barleywine. Sweet caramel and somewhat citrusy hops. Not all that complex. Fairly bitter but the sweetness smooths it out. Overall, not worth the abv.","  rDev Appearance – This pours a clear, innocent-looking light copper in color with a nice big white head.  Smell – The hops are raw and complex and very fresh. The website doesn’t provide much detail on this ale but it almost has to be dry-hopped. The pine in particular is not resiny but fresh like right out of the ground. I also get some fresh tangerines and just cut grapefruit.  The malt is masked by the hops but a nice sweetness peeks through. It’s a very light caramel which again would probably be a sledgehammer with most beers but here barely provides balance.  Taste – The hops here are gigantic. As in the nose, it is the fresh non-resiny pine that leads the way. It is so smooth and so big I had to do a double-take. The orange provides fluidity and a nice citrus contrast. The malt comes on bigger at the taste so although not an even balance by any means it keeps this from tasting cheap.  Mouthfeel – Huge for the style, this is nearly full-bodied with a giant bone dryness that isn’t offense due to the sweetness of the orange and malt. Again, in any other beer the drying here would be almost undrinkable but with this offering it goes down quite smoothly. This beer can’t possible be more drinkable.  I find the word smooth coming to mind every few seconds. Everything about this ale screams it. This is the embodiment of how to make a big, giant beer drinkable without requiring 10,000 baby sips to finish the bottle.","  rDev Bottled 5/26/15; drank 8/9/15 @ the Yarchives.   Semi-opaque orange appearance.   A rough pour yielded a big white head; frothy lace.   Fresh soap, mango &amp; honey notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Honey, caramel &amp; dry citrus flavors up front; a dry, bitter finish.   Booze heat emerged as this warmed. Basically an American barleywine in my opinion; not a great example either.","  rDev Golden and slightly hazy, with slow rising bubbles. Topped with 3 fingers of yellow tinged head.  Smells of pine, citrus, pineapple, and candied ginger.  Tastes of the same, with a big alcohol backbone, and grapefruit pith bitterness.  Medium to slightly heavy, syrupy body with lots of carbonation.  Got in Sacramento, drinking in Redding, Oct 9th, 2018.","  rDev Pours a medium amber with a well retained one inch white head that left excellent lacing. Smells of citrus, malts, pine and alcohol. Taste is very well balanced between caramel malts and citrus hops, with grapefruit, apricot, lemon, mango,orange, grass, pine and an alcohol bite. Medium bodied and carbonation, mildly dry finish that is also slightly sweet.","  rDev Deep copper gold color with off white color cap and lacing.  Aroma of rich malt overlain with piney, spicy, citrus hops.  Taste is richly malty with a strong hop presence. There's nothing mild mannered about this one as it pushes it's broad shoulders through the crowd in a way that you would notice even if you weren't looking. Malt is rich and deep with an equal hop presence marching alongside. Quite a mouthful, so to speak. A fairly complex flavor that's moreso in most all ways that I could describe a beer.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  I don't see this as a food matching brew, or even one I would want in several doses. It is an interesting take on how much a brewer can cram into a beer when they put their mind to it. Some reviewers have mentioned a  booziness  that I don't notice but I take my whisky straight so what do I know. It won't knock a casual drinker over or grow hair on a bald man but this is one big boy take on beer.","  rDev Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a a medium coppery amber with a fine, two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing, looks nice. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus hops, orange, grapefruit, light stone fruit. Flavor follows with caramel malt, citrus and lightly tropical hops, orange, grapefruit, mango and light stone fruit, finishes with citrus and lightly piney hops with a little lingering lemon and orange. Medium bodied with light creaminess and good carbonation. A great traditional style imperial IPA with the caramel and citrus profile that I am always happy to return to after a few of the newer styles. My taste definitely runs to lingering caramel and aggressive hop bitterness with good herbal notes. Nicely done and welcome to our market (one of the last standard Founders to reach the northwest).","  rDev Copper colored with a light haziness. There's a fingernail of off white on top. Moderate soapy lacing. The aroma is of pine sol and grassy hops. I'm tasting very resinous piney hops with just an edge of cedar and light malt. The mouth is sticky and chewy.","  rDev Poured cold from a 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Deep golden colored body, with a finger or so of off-white head that settled after a few moments. Minimal lacing. This sample was three months past the bottling date, and was quite malt forward and boozy. The hop character had faded quite a bit, Still pretty tasty, though. A little sweet, with notes of honey, caramel malt, and earthy and grassy hops. Good mouthfeel, with a mostly dry finish and a little lingering sweetness. To be fair, I'll revisit this if and when I can find it fresh(er). Caveat emptor.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  Fairly clear yellow color with a good head and lacing. Citrus, somewhat boozey smell and taste. A nice touch of funky dankness. The citrus included some orange and grapefruit. Nice bobble IPA.","  rDev Pours a clear dark gold color with white head leaving plenty of lacing. Nose is hops,citrus and sweet malt. Taste follows with mild bitterness ,pretty mellow for the abv. Finishes a bit on the dry side. Nicely done.","  rDev Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is light gold, head is off white with fine bubbles that presents about 1 inch thick and then lingers well with solid 1/4 inch top and great sticky lacing on the glass sides.   Smell is pine dominant then a grapefruit citrus rind finish - big, strong, bitter.  Taste continues the aroma's path - big pine, solid citrus rind and pithiness, some notable malt sweetness but base malt, lighter herbal and grassy flavors as you finish.   Mouthfeel is excellent for a 9.4% brew - light sweetness, good lingering bitterness, perfect carbonation.  Overall a super easy drinking strong DIPA with great flavor, good aroma, and an excellently balanced mouthfeel.","  rDev L: Slightly hazy--perhaps chill haze, though--translucent deep gold (almost orange) with a firm white cap of head. Moderate retention. A small soapy film lingers. Sheets of lacing are left.  S: Earthy, pine needle, pithy yellow grapefruit, diluted lemon, pineapple, blueberry.  T: Yellow grapefruit and lemon upfront, along with some pineapple and blueberry. Super earthy throughout. Crisp biscuit/cracker malt backbone. Pine on the finish. Intensely bitter finish lingers forever.  F: Medium-bodied, very well carbonated, smooth, crisp, and moderately dry. Sticky on the aftertaste with lingering resins.  O: A really great DIPA. I'm so glad that Founders brought this one back.","  rDev Poured from tap into mini shaker, good 1 finger head, good retention and lacing. Clear dark golden in the glass. Smells of citrus, pine and wood. Taste sweet caramel malt, old school and flaunting it. Good citrus and pine, followed up by a good fi4m bitterness. Slight residual sweetness on the finish, in a good way. Good dank finish.","  rDev Bottled on 5/17/18  Pours a bright but dark copper-gold with hints of honey topped with a soft, white head which dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves lacing spattered all throughout the glass.  Smell is of wet, earthy hops with a hint of dankness; soft, sweet (nearly honeyed) malts round out the aroma really nicely.  The taste begins as an amalgamation of restrained herbal bitterness and builds slowly toward a sopping-wet dankness with bits of hemp that becomes almost overwhelming at times; so earthy and raw.  Mouthfeel is an interesting balance of both dry and sticky; low carbonation and an extremely subtle crispness finishes things off; no real trace of booze.   This is a straightforward and really well-put-together DIPA. The heavy, earthy qualities threaten its balance at times, but also allow it a character of its own. Overall, a good option to keep in mind if you're looking for a traditional hop bomb that balances precariously between overwhelming and just right.","  rDev 12oz bottled 5/17/18 (35 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 9.4% ABV 86 IBU. The beer pours bright golden yellow with abundant off white head. Retention and lacing are well above average. The aroma is faint, as in, I can't really smell anything. Just some vague caramel sweetness. The taste is light caramel, a bit of earthy hops, and some residual alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is some hop shellac and old school feel, but relatively little booze for the ABV. Overall, very good. Somewhere amazing to me how fast this style has evolved. Drinks like 2010, but I like it.","  rDev Pours a clear gold. The nose is grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, and a little pine. The flavor is bitter orange, lemon, and bitter grapefruit peel, dry pine, and a savory touch of herbs, juniper berries, &amp; sage. Medium body, crisp finish.","  rDev Pours a foggy orange-yellow with a finger of white foam. Head retention is fair with a few strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is clean and sharp notes of pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops. Flavor profile is pine, resin, citrus, tropical fruits, and hint of floral on the back. Nice blend of hops, and while they are supported, the malts and underlying base notes are hidden. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, grainy, and harsh-carbonation texture. Overall, loads of depth as far as hops, but that depth covers up everything else in the mix. It's a clean and pleasantly drinkable double IPA.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Fairly nice imperial IPA from Founders. Nice golden-amber color, mild head with just a little lingering lacing. Smells of malt, fruity and grassy hops. Tastes of the same hops, mixed with caramel, malt and molasses. Mild mouthfeel, slight bitter aftertaste, decent carbonation and mild taste of alcohol throughout (especially as the beer warmed). A solid beer but a little underwhelming.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, bottled on 05.17.18... poured into a snifter)  L: crystal-clear brassy amber liquid... inch-high stand of loose, frothy foam on the pour, but it somehow collapsed rather fast after a brief hold; a few thin, crusty splashes of lace... jewel-like glow, looks inviting  S: wonderful musky fruitiness - dried orange flesh, hint of fresh apricot, dried citrus peel - nothing unique, but appealingly earthy, leafy, resinous... maybe a soft hint of medicinal alcohol, but not all that boozy  T: bold piney pop, bitter grassy note swells in aftertaste, oily resins and a subtle hint of sweetish candy-like grain linger in aftertaste... pungent, sharp, almost peppery-spicy alcohol flamed by the rip of the hops stings the palate at the start... bit of an almost nutty cookie note from the grain starts emerging after the second sip, builds and washes out after 10 sec... not much depth/layering to flavors, but their intensity is loud  F: alcohol/hop sting leaves a rather potent hum long-lasting past the finish (it's been 2+ min since first sip and it's still buzzing)... despite a touch of resiny stick, overall has a subtly slick, glossy/glassy texture, and with the alcohol feels like it cleans the palate like a medicinal mouthwash, which is great here - really livens the palate  O: pretty straight-forward double IPA, familiar flavors - best things about it being its bright, biting, bitter attack and long, dry, resiny finish... its bitterness and hop-glazed malt coloring begs for another visit","  rDev The beer is a clear, bright gold color. There is a small white head that disappears quickly, and a little bit of lace. Fruity aroma, mostly citrus, but also some tropical. Then some pine. There is a sweet malt background.

Light milk chocolate and and more bitter roasted malt with a nice doughy malt presence in the background  M: lighter side of medium with high carbonation  O: an awesome American Porter.

Good head retention.  Aroma: The beer has a nice coffee aroma with a bit of burnt carbon in the background.  Taste: The beer has a pleasant coffee flavor with a light bit of toasty carbon and a very small amount of pine.  Mouthfeel: It is easy drinking, medium-full bodied, with a medium bitterness.  Overall: It is a nice flavorful beer that is pleasant to drink. My favorite part of the beer is the light toasty character that blends with a pine-like flavor. I would drink it again and I do recommend it.","  rDev Good, but highly overrated. Do try if you're hailing from out of the region.","  rDev Pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with a moderate tan head. Aroma and flavor are chocolate, dark roasted malts, and dark fruit/fig.

Bitterness balanced and matched to level of maltiness, resulting in an even flavor. M: Medium bodied with medium effervescence. Creamy and very smooth. O: Drinkable and highly enjoyable. Very balanced. Had two and will certainly have more in the future.","  rDev Can’t believe I’ve never rated this before!  Pours a deep, opaque black. With a finger of khaki head.  Smells of toasted chocolate malts, with a crispness rather than sweetness, that hints at a larger presence of hops.  Smooth, creamy, chocolate with a clean crispness that I can best describe as spruce.  As far as body goes, it is a lighter, very drinkable porter. Not sweet, more dry.","  rDev Delicious, rich, smooth porter that really impressed me. Dark brown, almost black color with some slowly-fading tan head and some nice sheets of lingering lacing. Smells of roast coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes similarly, along with caramel, vanilla and malt. Amazingly smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. I’m used to a little more bite when I sample porters and this one is just so buttery smooth. Well done!","  Ruby brown body, shimmering and deep. Two and a half finger beige head slowly dissipates to a faint ring. The nose is malty with some char, mollases and earthy hops.

Smooth and light mouth feel with a medium body and carbonation with a slight black coffee aftertaste.","  Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, dark brown color with some deep amber/ruby highlights around the edges when held up to the light.

Aromas of roasted caramel malts along with hints of cocoa and coffee and some roasted nuts. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted caramel malt sweetness that's followed by cocoa and coffee notes and some roasted nuttiness. There's a bit of an earthy hop presence that has just a bit of bitterness. Nice balance of flavors. Has a crisp, yet smooth and somewhat creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a slightly dry aftertaste. A very solid beer here indeed that's spot on for the style.  Eric","  rDev 16oz nitro draft presentation into a pint glass boasts a night black body resting beneath a persistent 1/4in blanket of cream colored head leaving erratic webbed lacing.

Overall one of the best.","  Poured into pint glass. It pours nearly black with dark walnut and cola hues when held to the light, and a large, foamy, khaki-colored head and lacing. The nose features roasted malt, burnt coffee, and nuts. The taste is similar to the nose but there is an additional hoppy bitterness at the finish. This Porter is fairly light in body with moderate carbonation, and with an ABV of only 5.2% and only 30 IBU, it's really easy to drink.

Scattered, patchy lacing adorns the glass walls. Before a strong light at the thinnest part of the glass, some slight ruby highlights can be seen.   Aroma: Strong notes of bourbon, coffee, bitter cocoa, vinous alcohol, molasses and caramel dominate the aroma. There are also notes of wood; the alcohol is quite spicy.  Taste: The taste begins with notes of molasses, caramel, coffee, bitter cocoa, bourbon, dark fruit, spicy alcohol. As the taste progresses, the wood and bourbon notes firm a solid undercurrent to the taste, advancing as the taste progresses, as well as bitter cocoa. The alcohol produces a moderate and pleasant warming sensation. The taste concludes with a modest and lingering wave of bourbon and wood.  Mouth feel: Fairly full and soft, with only modest carbonation.  Drinkabilty/notes: Really quite nice, and a fitting toast to the New Year of 2022. Would pair admirably with rich chocolate desserts.  Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip.","  rDev 12oz bottle, served in a snifter glass. Bottled on 09/30/21 09:26.   Appearance: Pitch black, light tan dense head. Some strands and sheets of lacing which dissipated very slowly.   Smell: Vanilla, light oak, bourbon.   Taste: Well blended chocolate, coffee, bourbon, roasted malt. Nothing really stands out among the flavors. All are mild and well blended together.   Mouthfeel: Nice thickness, quite warming from the higher ABV, even though it's not harsh or that noticeable. Dry finish. Very light carbonation.   Overall / Drinkability: A very subtle/smooth barrel aged stout. There is some bourbon barrel character, but it's mixed in with all the other flavors. A good sipping beer - quite drinkable. Would pair well with some desserts, and maybe a few other main courses as well. Quite nice and I wouldn't mind having it again.","  rDev Appearance: Dark brown to black, big head.  Smell: Chocolate, wood, vanilla, booze.  Taste: Sweet chocolate, then moderate barrel-wood flavor. Sweet throughout, with a somewhat light feel for the ABV.  Overall: Another classic that I've finally got around to reviewing. I've had Dragon's Milk at beerfests and bars, but never reviewed. It's a very good beer, maybe a slight step lower than some of the other heavyweights but still quite tasty.","  rDev What a wonderful blend of bourbon and chocolate. Near perfect blend and balanced. Really enjoyed this one.","  rDev In a snifter, obsidian, 1/2 finger head and some good lacing. Nose is solid but not overpowering bourbon, molasses, faint vanilla, bakers chocolate. Taste carries the nose forward...comes to a nice clean finish and point at the end, though I’m not getting much in terms of hoppy liveliness or bite.   All in al, very nice...delicious without being overdone. I don’t go for big stouts that often, but I still can’t believe I’ve never tried this one before, even though it’s always around. This won’t be the last one of these for me.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a Bells tulip/snifter glass; bottled 06/15/20. A: Pours an essentially black with a no more than one finger, dark tan head that clears to a rim and spotty lacing. S: Aromas of caramel, chocolate, bourbon, sarsaparilla, vanilla, and molasses predominate. T: Sweet and boozy. Flavors follow the nose with a lot of sarsaparilla and booziness. Bitterness solidly present but in the background. F: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. O: Purchased this in Ann Arbor, while dropping off my kid for the Fall semester. Full disclosure, I am falling out of limerence with these booze barrel aged and adjuncted stouts, and return to the simple pleasure of Guinness, but felt that the bourbon barrel aging definitely added an additional dimension to the olfactory and flavor pallets here. Would definitely buy, order, or serve to friends.","  rDev 22oz (2015) into a tulip. Pours a semi-transparent deep chocolate brown with a thin, wispy head.  Aroma is dark chocolate and bitter roasted malt off the bat, a touch of vanilla. Solid bourbon presence.  Taste follows nose. Chocolate, dark malt, toasted coconut, vanilla, bourbon. Really nice balance here, no single element dominates.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, not too heavy. Just right really.

Black colored body with a considerable brown back lit edge. Two fingers of tan head, settles back to frothy cap. Leaves behind webs of lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malt, vanilla, and oak barrel. Taste is slightly sweet, with dark roasted malts, a little char, and lots of vanilla, with the second half influenced by the bourbon oak barrel. Bits of chocolate, licorice, and dark fruit. Thicker mouth feel, with a very smooth texture. Very good carbonation. The smoothness of the mouth texture is outstanding, and works well with the vanilla flavor. The very wisp of bitterness is immediately counteracted by the vanilla and oak. Higher ABV% is reasonably well hidden. The after taste only exists because of the creaminess of the body.","  rDev Bottled and poured into my trusty skull glass creating a jet black bodied beer with massive tan head that dissipates to splodges  Aroma is bourbon charcoal  Treacle and whisky with a hint of gunpowder","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 8/19/19 into the test glass A - Inky black backdrop, gently carbonated, an off white ring clings to the glass wall.

Well blended flavors with nothing extremely pronounced Mouthfeel is pleasant, smooth but a little thin.  Overall this is a nice beer and a great value. In this era of bombastic stouts made with everything under the sun, this classic can definitely get overshadowed but this is a solid and tasty stout and a great value. Good solid blend of dark fruit, roasty malt, bitterchocolate and molasses all melded sweetly together. Don't sleep on it.","  rDev My last beer in Fargo-Moorhead on 4-30-2019 the day I checked out of my apartment. A farewell bourbon barrel stout that was very dark blackish in color with a decent lacing. Light bourbon mixed with dark malts, tasty.","  rDev 2012 vintage on draft...drank early 2013.   Black liquid.   Khaki head; strong lace.   Oak and bourbon notes in the nose.   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Wood truly dominates the flavor, with only booze competing. Unimpressive.","  rDev A 22oz bottle of bourbon barrel aged stout dated 12/18/18. Slick oily black appearance with a thin veneer of brown head. Mild aroma of sour mash. Flavor is all about that bourbon barrel, boozy with vanilla and oak. Stout flavors are clearly an afterthought here. Roasted barley provides the color, like a porter, but roasty and toasty flavors hardly make an appearance. Though boozy, it doesn't burn, and at 11% this could prove quite dangerous (I'd have guessed around 8.5%-9%). BBA imperial stout is BBA imperial stout... but this one doesn't impress.","  rDev Poured from a single serve into a tulip  Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head, and a somewhat thin viscosity (probably from the barrel aging) but good lacing. A good pour overall.  Aromas of coffee, vanilla, oak, graham cracker, and char. Milk stout sweetness mixed with some astringent character.  The flavor is very oakey and boozy up front--almost too boozy. However, after the initial  brace  of those notes, chocolate, root beer/aged vanilla, and char come through, along with black licorice and herbal notes.  The mouthfeel is solid but not special. A little sticky in some ways--although the carbonation helps lift it a bit.  Overall, I wanted to like this brew more. It is pretty good, but not top of the line.","  rDev From notes 1/27/13: Pours clear, deep brown with red highlights producing 1.5 fingers of tan, somewhat lasting, frothy head that leaves a nice coating of lace. Aroma is coco, dark chocolate, bourbon and woody vanilla with hints of caramel, coconut, coffee and figs. Taste is semisweet chocolate, heavy bourbon, dark roast, toasted pumpernickel and molasses with hints of burnt caramel, toffee and dark fruits. The booze is up front and forceful. No noticeable hop presence. Aftertaste is boozy, sweet,faintly peppery but short-lived with only a hint of bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, creamy, silky and thinly chewy with low carbonation.","  rDev Pours a very dark brown with a half inch beige head that settles pretty quickly to a ring and leaves ample lacing.

Medium bodied for the style, light to medium carbonation, creamy mouth feel.","  rDev Dragon's Milk has a medium, beige head, a dark brown appearance, with ruby highlights and moderate lacing.

I waited a while to try this, and glad I did on tap....","  rDev Very nice stout that lives up to its high expectations. Nice deep dark black color, some tan head and a little spotty lingering lacing. Smells of bourbon, wood, vanilla and a little chocolate.

Good carbonation and the flavors really mellowed as the beer warmed. Outstanding beer!","  rDev First had Dragon’s Milk, my first beer from New Holland, poured from 12-oz. bottle, stamped “BOTTLED 03/14/18,” into solo cup.

In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 3. Very oak-forward, but so well implemented that it doesnt bother at all, maybe thanks to the vanilla. Best oaking ive experienced. Abv completely hidden","  rDev Poured from 22oz bottle into a tulip. Bottled 3/20/18.  Appearance: totally black with a thick finger of frothy tan foam atop. Great!  Smell: sweet, with caramel, toffee, vanilla and bourbon aromas. There's perhaps a little chocolate in the mix, but it's a bit more  barrel  than  stout . Still, a good-smelling beer.  Taste: rich and malty with a pretty hefty barrel character. There's good vanilla and caramel character up front, then the flavor fades into a general booziness. There's a little chocolate and roast in the mix, but they play second fiddle to the barrel.  Mouthfeel: rich body with a good level of carbonation and a smooth, satisfying creaminess. I really like it.  Overall: this beer has a lot going for it, and it's really tasty. However, I'd love a little bit more  stout  going on -- chocolate, or coffee, or general roastiness, or something.","  rDev Bottled on 4/13/17 (2017 Vintage)  Look: black with a frothy, tan head  Smell: toasted oak and vanilla, a bit of smoke, chocolate, and a touch of bourbon all come together nicely  Taste: follows the nose while adding an enhanced roasty quality throughout; there's a barrel-like char and vanilla sweetness that reminds of fresh s'mores and a bit of bubblegum  Feel: creamy with a good bit of carbonation, but not enough to be too distracting  Big, malty, and roasty, with a year in the bottle mellowing things out nicely. A simple yet flavorful BA stout, and a good entry point for exploring the style.","  rDev 12oz. bottled 8-15-17 Dark brown out of the bottle, near black in the glass with a 1  tan head that falls to a full cap and sits. Light aroma of roasted malts, cream, some booze.Some wood, vanilla. Really nice complex aroma. The flavor at this point is less intense than the aroma, maybe a time of development currently? Expected way more from the nose than what I got out of the flavor. Not bad at all just not up to what the nose was putting out there. Thinner body than expected. HOT @ 11%!  Good but not great at this point.","  rDev A: jet black color, almost like motor oil. Thin tan film for a head  S: bourbon, cola, molasses, dates, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a subtle berry note. Bourbon and chocolate dominate the nose  T: cola, dark and milk chocolate, bourbon, oak, tannins, caramel, leather. Alcohol and oak at the end  M: heavier side of medium mouth, silky sticky mouthfeel. Low carbonation  O: barrel aged stout as advertised. The barrrel character is mellow, but noticeable. Nothing mind blowing, but has a nice harmonization - not too heavy on the barrel not too heavy on the sweet","  rDev I seriously thought I had this beer, but as I age my memory fades. I do not recall drinking this beer, but that does not mean anything. Poured into my tulip glass at 44 degrees. The light tan head is creamy and airy. The retention on the head is par. The head left no lacing as it dissipated. The color of the beer is dark brown, nearly black and opaque. The appearance of this beer is above average.   The barrel age on the beer is not as strong on the nose. The aromas in the beer are vanilla, burnt sugar, oak, molasses, earth, roasted dark malts, caramel, toffee, bready, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and solvent-like.  The flavors in the beer are burnt sugar, oak, molasses, roasted dark malt, toffee, coffee, chocolate, toffee, bready, dark fruits, and phenolic taste.   The mouthfeel of the beer is harsh and slightly warm. The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a medium-plus finish.   The beer is lacking many qualities from making this a great beer. The body of the beer is too thin for an imperial stout. The balance of the beer is out of kilter. The flavor is not harmonious. Lastly, the barrel age of the beer is a joke. I do get the barrel flavors but quite weak."]},{"Name":"Bomb!","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30356/94350/","Brewery":"Prairie Artisan Ales","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":13.00,"Score":99.0,"Comments":["  rDev Really good stout!!!!

Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters).

A hot peppery smell dominates and behind it, some roasted malt and chocolate. The color of this brew is the common black coffee and without any head, nor lacing, this looks like it could be a black coffee soda. But the taste is so much more complex and interesting. First, this is incredibly smooth for a laceless stout. It has a very good body, rich and velvety across the tongue. There's much to taste, mostly chocolate, somehow neither sweet, nor bitter, a hint of vanilla and just a little peppery heat. It's definitely not a burn, just a little heat. Actually, there's more pepper to the nose than to the taste. But that's OK. Why argue with a near perfect balance. Absolutely no clue that this rings in with an astonishing 13% ABV.

In the nose: chili pops out first, coffee next, then cocoa fills in next....sweet, hot, rich, immense.  In the mouth: sweetness first, coffee follows, then comes the heat. Nicely integrated hugeness--a calamity of flavors that somehow comes together. More sweet, more chocolate, more coffee, more huge. The chili becomes a little more subdued as the other flavors commingle.  Has alcohol arrived yet? Oh, it's only 13%, is it? It's slowly, inevitably becoming apparent.

Initially slight sweetness followed by a bitter/booze burn/pepper combo that all melds together.  Medium smooth bodied, with a little boozy kick.  Overall: Nice.

The flavors meld together perfectly, with the chili and chocolate tying the coffee and dark fruits all together  This is more carbonated than I was expecting, but still very full.

What does settle around the glass is ivory in color.  Chocolate-covered coffee beans and vanilla on the nose. Not getting any hints of chili, but you don’t need it. The inviting aromas on this are great on their own.  More of the same in the flavors; milk chocolate, light roast coffee, and sweet vanilla.

Overall a delicious beer.","  rDev Pours black with a small tan head that vanished quickly. Nice aroma with dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla, peppers, and coffee. Tastes just like it smells. Same exact score as a result. Medium bodied with modest carbonation. The 14 % abv is hidden very well. A nicely made beer.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, no dating, 13% abv... poured into a fat tulip)  L: dark brown, almost black liquid; med-dark brown foam, inch+ high on pour, recedes rather quick, losing a shade or two of darkness in the process... no lacing  S: chilies and cocoa powder straight away, with ground espresso slowly emerging; the vanilla isn't overt, but certainly colors the overall smell... little hint of booze of which its spice may or may not be accented by the chilies... nice aromas, but overall intensity curiously restrained  T: rather busy blend of the constituent flavors up front, with a boozy, roasty coffee tone in the finish; burnt raisin and malty espresso lingering in the aftertaste, subtle peppery spice clinging to the back of the palate; soft essence of vanilla (extract) slowly emerging back up the throat to the front of the palate... underlying malt milk washes through the bottom with each sip with the spice static cleaved atop; nice degree of dryness, avoids reaching syrupy sweetness  F: medium malty body, with some subtle satiny/oily viscosity trailing back in the finish... the chili spice and booze heat a rather mellow, comfortable warmth and tingle - more like a heating pad on low than a flame heat... by the end, its balance of smoothness and glow deserves applause  O: flavors are a bit muddled, but their chord has a pleasant, soothing timbre; its spice/heat is expertly measured... grows on ya... certainly do-able solo, but better off shared","  rDev Not finding a date on the bottle, just a couple stamps without much meaning to the drinker. This is my first beer from Prairie and I’ve been eyeing it for a while on the shelf at Grassroots in Jax wondering about the hype. At $9 for a 12oz bottle one has to assume this is not just a great, but stellar beer.  I chose this as a celebration beer for one of the biggest moments of my life. A true “bomb” of a result/outcome and couldn’t be happier, though also still shocked. Probably need to sleep and a new morning will bring clarity.  But this beer is also bringing clarity. That it is almost certainly worth the cost. And that just because a beer includes hot peppers doesn’t mean they’ll overwhelm nor serve as a reason to shun a beer with such an ingredient.  I’ve let this beer breathe for hours as I sipped it and now it’s drinking like a Port. How any beer can be this good is mind boggling. You get the coffee and chocolate without a doubt, dark yet sweet and earthy. The vanilla is more subtle and the peppers even subtler, though there’s a bit more pepper heat than alcohol heat. The booze creates a pleasant tingle that finishes so well. Body is silky smooth. This is a bonkers beer. A definite treat and probably the one experience I’ll have with it unless it’s on draft or in another form such as Pirate Bomb. Totally worth the money, the celebration, and the long-winded description. A masterpiece!","  rDev Poured a motor oil black with an above average body. Carbonation is medium light which overall produced a really nice body Aroma is coffee, roasted malt, and chilli peppers. Taste follows the aroma with coffee taking the lead followed by the roasted malt . The chilli pepper was very present and the heat was really well incorporated, never overpowering but very much there.  Overall it is an excellent beer, definitely above average on every level Only criticism is that sometimes the chilli tasted a bit like unripe green peppers.","  rDev 12 oz bottle 1 yo bottle. Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head, nice lacing and soda like carbonation. Aroma is of roasted malt, toast, dark fruit, poppy seeds and cacao. Body is full, creamy and crisp. Taste is of chili pepper, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and vanilla. Finish is long and spicy. Great RIS, too bad I can’t have chili pepper.","  rDev Another amazing imperial stout from this incredible brewery. Really competes well with their Birthday Bomb, as well as Founders’ KBS. Dark black color with some mild lingering tan head and some spotty lingering lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and molasses. Tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, currant, caramel and a great malt backbone. Very smooth, slightly creamy with quite a thick mouthfeel. Great amount of carbonation. As with their Birthday Stout, this was a very high ABV beer but I tasted very little strong alcohol flavor. I would love to see an outstanding beer like this aged in bourbon barrels - it’s so good and so tasty and just so damn smooth. Well done!","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Looks like a March or a January 2017 bottling date, as stamped on bottle neck (03171). Black colored body, with slight mahogany back lit highlights. Not much of a head upon initial pouring but stays around as interrupted cap and ring. Quite a bit of spotting patterns left behind.  Chiles are still present in the aroma, along with roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Taste has dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Quite well balanced. Mouth feel is medium to thick. Okay carbonation. Beer has maintained its main advertised features for a term of 1-1/2 years in the bottle. Overall a very well balanced and taste nuanced beer.","  rDev Pitch black. Small tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, with a bit of pepper. Coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla taste. Warmth from the chilis. Perfect mouthfeel. All the ingredients played well together.","  rDev A: silky jet black color with a thin tan film for a head  S: roasted malt, dark chocolate, a nice kick of chilli upfront. Smooth vanilla and baking chocolate behind that. Some roasted wood, and raw coffee beans to finish. Real rich smelling  T: roasted malt, chilli peppers, cola, and sweet malts. Big vanilla extract and dark chocolate in there as well. Some sweet malt to balance it out, and some spicy chilli at the end for a nice kick. Mild coffee beans in here as well  M: heavy mouthfeel with mid carbonation   O: very well made stout with nicely harmonized flavors. Definitely a chilli kick in here for sure. You taste it and feel it on the lips","  rDev I have wanted this beer for a while now. The beer is 48 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The hard pour on the beer into the glass produced a one finger light tan head. The head quickly dissipated, it was sad to see this. The color is SRM 35 A dark oily brown and is not opaque. The head reduced to a ring around the glass. The appearance of the beer is fair.   The aromas of the beer are dark roasted coffee with chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, chili, molasses, brown sugar, dark roasted malt, biscuits, yeast, and char.   The coffee and the chili is prevalent. Additional flavors are chocolate, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, char, oak, biscuits, yeast, caramel, toffee, anise, and a touch smoky.   The mouthfeel of the beer is thick and chewy.   The body of the beer is full, medium-low carbonation, and a full finish.   The flavors in the beer are phenomenal. The beer is rich and satisfying. I enjoyed this beer.","  rDev Insanely smooth and without the tiniest hint of alcohol despite the very high ABV. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate but I cannot detect any chilies. Thick, and full of flavor this is one insanely good American Imperial Stout!","  rDev I’ve walked past this one several times and balked at the price. I finally decided to treat myself. Pours a viscous engine oil looking dark brown/black liquid. Due to the high ABV, there is no head, instead, a minimalist creamy tan film and thin lacing throughout. Lovely aroma that highlights cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. A spicy chili pepper aroma more pronounced throughout. The taste opens sweetly, with decadent flavors of chocolate, dark caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and dessert liqueur. Minimal perception of hops bitterness, instead, an espresso like roasted malt flavor is subtly perceptible amidst the sweetness and spices. Speaking of spice, the chili pepper spice is the centerpiece and what truly sets this imperial stout apart. It starts off slightly perceptible in the finish. However, it gradually develops in the middle palate, heating up the mouth and throat, never overwhelming and balancing beautifully with the chocolate cake sweetness.  Full bodied, viscous, rich and robust. Amazing balance between sweet and spicy. Alcohol is beautifully hidden and drinks dangerously well. So worth it! A true wow beer! Delicious!","  rDev Pour is jet black practically. A big warming coffee, dark chocolate, and minor cinnamon filled aroma. The coffee in the nose is probably the boldest aroma and it is fantastic. And I think you can smell a little chili pepper in there. Roasty flavor is quickly sweetened by milk chocolate notes which then transition to a mild warming burn from the pepper. That note really lingers long past the finish. You can tell this thing is big, but not 13% big. Price tag was steep, but if you can get by that I’d say it is worth trying.","  rDev Cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. THere is no dating on the label or bottle. Ive had it for about a year in my cellar but received in a trade where it was a vintage bottle from partner cellar. So I dont know what year this is. The beer pours a dark cola brown with a dense creamy tan head of 1.5 cm that fades quickly to a sturdy edge layer. the foam lingers on the edge until the glass is empty. Very active fine carbonation streams rising to the surface of my glass based on the surface spiral movements, which is a cool impact.  Lots of roasted malt and dark chocolate on the nose, also with some coffee ground and a bit of spicy peppery notes. Vegetal pepper not the black pepper spice that can be attached to ethanol notes. No hop presence on this big stout at the aroma. First sip reveals a silky textured beer with average body and fine gentle carbonation. thought it may be a little thicker based on the pour, but this is good so far. I get milk chocolate and darker bittersweet chocolate notes up front, with a dose of roasted malt and coffee grounds in the middle which is followed by lingering brown sugar and some spicy pepper note. The pepper is still tingly long after each swallow.  I never get any hint of the 13% which is pretty amazing considering the booze in this bottle. COuld make it a little dangerous. I wonder if the spicy pepper note would disappear if cooking with this beer.....it could be the ultimate chilli beer I think. But it is also very enjoyable to drink, so I understand not going the cooking route. Glad to have tried this one in a bottle as Ive only had draft prior to tonight.","  rDev Pours a super dark brown that is almost black. The head is also very dark - like a chocolate cappuccino color. The nose has plenty of roast along with a touch of heat. The flavor is less roasty than the nose might indicate but the roast is still very forward along with some residual chocolate sweetness. The heat comes along on the finish and is on the verge of overly done. The body is adequate for the style but I was expecting something thicker (for some reason)."]},{"Name":"Expedition Stout","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/1444/","Brewery":"Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store","Style":"Stout - Russian Imperial","Alcohol":10.50,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled 9/3/20.

I found this beer to be surprisingly special. I wasn't really expecting much but that's usually the time when the unexpected happens. The unexpected was simply what I got with this - from a beautifully dark beer with late forming, tan head (another unexpected surprise) to the roasted malt smell with chocolate notes - all of this was a very good first impression. Mouthfeel was a bit watery but still medium-bodied with a taste that matched. Yes sir, this is something unexpected, and good.","  rDev Bottle poured into a snifter  Jet back motor oil, one finger dense brown foam cap, some lacings  aroma of roasted malts, bakers chocolate, dark roast coffee   taste is roasted malts, bakers chocolate, espresso roasted coffee  creamy mouthfeel on the first sip but a bitterness lingers   Good beer","  rDev 12oz bottle dated 10/11/18.

Aroma is big and malty, hitting roasty, toasty, nutty malts along the way. There is a little herbal and spicy hop action that livens up the aroma a bit, although it's still heavily focused and centered on dark malts. A light addition of chocolate and dark fruits rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruits with roasted, toasted, nutty, and bready malts behind. Hops are more of a whisper here, but hit notes of herbal, spicy, and floral. Mouth feel is dense and thick with a velvety texture. Overall, a big stout with big malts and still perceptible hops.

Bottled on date is '08/31/2016'. Black colored body, with a very thin mahogany edge when back lit. Half finger of tan head blooms at the end of the pour.

Taste is silky and spicy, with dark roasted malts, a range of chocolate from milk to dark, with a bit of smoke and a hint of dark fruit. Has a bit of peaty char deep into the after taste. Mouth feel is thick, mouth coating, and creamy. Some felt alcohol but certainly not a burn. Appropriate carbonation. Wonderful beer drinking experience, with rewards all through the taste profile (which is long and deep). This is a sipper beer because of all the nuances that can be discovered and savored, not because it is a challenging beer to drink.","  rDev From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with a bottling date of 09/10/18.

Low hop profile.  Full bodied mouthfeel. Smooth.  Along with the roasted sweetness in the flavor I pick up a hint of the 10.5% booze. There is a charcoal like character too and a semi-dry finish. A wonderful Imperial Stout.","  rDev Fantastic beer that I’ve been waiting to get my hands on for a while - indeed it’s everything I had hoped for.

Tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, plum, raisin, molasses, vanilla, caramel, malt and something else...graham cracker? Delicious. Nice smooth, sticky, creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. The high ABV doesn’t hit you upfront and this beer is dangerously, deceptively easy to drink.

I've been a big fan of Bell's darker beers that I've been able to get my hands on since we've started to see distribution over in New England. This is a beloved RIS, and one that I've never before been able to weigh in on. Super glad to get my hands on a single bottle! I had Black Note last week and thought it was great, but I definitely felt like I didn't quite know where it was coming from. This beer is the missing piece that I need to experience to put it all together!  Pours an intensely-dark color with a thin but very retentive mocha-colored head. Solid lace forms as I sip, giving this a really solid appearance. It reminds me of the very first few batches of Clown Shoes' Blaecorn Unidragon, a similarly huge RIS that went straight for the style.  The nose is incredibly roasty, with a big chocolate and caramel aspect that inevitably falls behind the roast. Caramel maltiness and Belgian chocolate round everything out. There's very little dark fruit compared to other Russian Imperial stout beers... this is all about the cocoa and earthiness! Hops seem relegated to backing up said earthy elements, but also seem to give off some herbal and floral character. Mostly sweet caramel and chocolate, though... a very decadent smelling RIS.  The flavor profile is sweeter than expected, with strong elements of Belgian chocolate, earthy hops and caramel/toffee. My tongue is utterly inundated by the intense roasty cocoa flavors here... it's almost too much; beyond the realm of what I want in this style of beer. Just absolutely decadent with pine-like bitterness following through and a bit of a floral element kicking around toward the finish. I'm unsure of whether or not this beer is really what I want in the RIS style, however. It tastes quite excellent, but it does have a bit too much roast for my taste.  The feel is moderately heavy with a bit more carbonation than I expected. Once again, this betrays what I assumed it would be... it is a large beer with an appropriately done body, and I get that, but it's just a little on the nose for me. I've known about this beer for a long time, and having now had it... I'm somewhat nonplussed. It's excellent for a strong stout, but maybe I would feel that it's even better with some time on it? Black Note is great with a year on it, so this is probably in the same realm.","  rDev Bottled 10/15/15; drank 9/2/17 @ the Yarchives.   Black/brown appearance.   A violent pour yielded a nice, noisy dark tan head; minimal lace.   Blackberry, dark chocolate, marshmallow, mild raspberry &amp; faint fresh earth notes in the nose.   Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel.   Dark chocolate, blackberry &amp; marshmallow flavors up front; fresh earth &amp; mild raspberry notes on the finish.

There is a bit of dark fruit and booze in there as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated and surprisingly dry and clean in the finish. Overall, excellent. This beer can be what you want it to be. Very bitter and raw fresh or mellow as it ages. Recommended.","  rDev I’m feelin’ buzzed and it’s all because... Yep! Raul got himself some Bell’s Expedition and he is ok with that.   Dark like the lump of coal I got in my stocking in the 4th grade (it was a bad year, my peeps) yet aromatic enough with bitter chocolate and coffee... Raul is like, “Ok, let’s dig a bit deeper.”   So the Raul man digs, and he sips, and he’s like, “Yeah, it’s aite. But it ain’t no FIS.” Flavor is there, but like my baby mama, it’s also a bit ornery, hot, and insipid.  Throw Bells Expedition Stout out of bed for eating crackers? No no no. But if I had my first choice in who I’d like to invite, FIS would get my vote instead.","  rDev Bottled 8/31/17. Reviewed 1/18/18. Rich, malty, aroma; dark fruit and chocolate. Deep black color with a 1/2 inch tan-to-brown head, receding fairly slowly, leaving thick lacing down the side of the glass. Thick, creamy feel. Chocolate and dark fruit (but less fruit in the taste than in the aroma), mild start with a nicely bitter middle and finish. You can tell this is a strong beer, but the alcohol is well-controlled in the taste. Just a very slight burn in the finish.","  rDev Poured from a single-serve into a stout glass  Pours opaque and motor-oil thick with a fantastic, two-finger, tan, foamy head and outstanding sticky lacing.  The aromas are super and complex. Multiple types of chocolate (cocoa, semi-sweet, and cake batter at various levels); dark fruits; toasted marshmallow; char; and just a hint of booze.   The flavors may be even more complex and nuanced than the nose. Chocolate on multiple levels, sweet, semi-sweet, and bitter, with hints of coffee (but not too much); dark fruits (fig, raisin) and dark cherries steal the show. The char is less pronounced on the palate than it is on the nose. The booze is definitely there, but it's a pleasing warming note, not a burning one.   The mouthfeel is simultaneously thick, chewy, and viscous, and eminently drinkable thanks to some extra carbonation and just the right amount of dryness. It never gets cloying or too sweet.   This RIS is right there at the top of the list. I've had RIS's that are better at certain attributes than this one, but the total package here it tough to beat. It is one of the best beers I've had lately, if not ever.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a tulip. bottled 9/28/16, so 15 months old.   jet black body, dark tan head, really nice lacing initially. faint carbonation up the sides of the tulip.  Nice and plummy dried fruit aroma.  taste is quite strongly molasses. medium roasted malt on the back end, dark fruit and faint chocolate notes. ever so slightly smoky and bitter. excellent taste.  mouth gets pretty close to full. finish is slightly sweet with roasted malts around the edge of the tongue and faintly bitter in the back of the mouth. 10.5abv isn't all that noticeable.  Overall, really enjoyable RIS. Happy to have the rest of the 6 pack for the next few weeks.","  rDev Another one that got ticked years ago, but was never reviewed. Fresh 2017 bottle to tulip glass. Pour is a jet black color with several fingers of thick, rich mocha head. Lots of spidery lacing left behind. Aroma is dark and roasty, with a boozy tinge. Flavors are big on roast and figs and plums, with a bitter bite and boozy undertones befitting the style. Thicker feel. Quite a nice companion to the Breakfast Stout I had earlier.","  rDev In a snifter, on tap, pours a dark mahogany black, creamy 1 finger khaki head with decent retention and good lacing. Nose is quite roasty and a little smoky, with good malt character, solid baker’s chocolate, a little sweet cream, a little (but not much) bitter coffee. Good, but for the style, nothing too special. Taste is a little more interesting to me, with a little leathery licorice and some fleshy dark fruit complementing the predominant slightly chewy chocolate, and a zippy hoppy edge that affects the feel more than it does the taste. A little smoke lingers. Fairly light feel and not very boozy, considering the abv. Can’t believe I haven’t rated this before. Solid offering, and more than well-well worth a shot."]},{"Name":"Bud Light","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/29/1320/","Brewery":"Anheuser-Busch","Style":"Lager - Light","Alcohol":4.20,"Score":47.0,"Comments":["  rDev No more should be needed than one brown twelve ounce bottle poured into a clear pint glass.

That’s like someone telling you that they haven’t seen Kim Kardashian’s film debut. Like, wtf?   Anyway, I’ve kind of gone full circle with this beer and I think that the only way to rate this thang is as an American Adjunct Lager.   Does it pour like Behati Prinsloo? Does it smell like Summer Altice? Hell, when you drink the damn thing does it feel like Nina Agdal giving you a ride? No way! But what is import here is flavor; and although it doesn’t really have any, it also doesn’t taste like the hood of a rusted over Chevy.   In Raul’s opinion, this is one of the better AAL’s.  Peace!","  rDev Best by 8/7/19  Pours a crystal clear body of about the palest straw can be; topped with a towering head of white foam that recedes quickly to a thin cap and slightly frothy collar; virtually no lacing.  Aroma’s first impression is an undertone of boggy skunk, with an offensiveness approaching that of an empty dumpster sitting in the sun; following are light tones of corn/grain teamed with sugar water.  Taste shows something vaguely floral/fruity off in the distance, but it soon fades, and it’s all rice water and thin grain from there. I really can’t say much else here, other than it seems to take the borderline-offensiveness of the aroma and water it down.  Mouthfeel has a thin body, mostly watery, but with a pleasant enough crispness from an over-amplified carbonation; fades to nothing once that short punch of the carbonation fizzles out around the mid-palate; a finish so watery you find yourself questioning if it’s even beer anymore.  I like to think I went in with an open mind, but this was simply not good, and that's being civil; it brings next to nothing to the table, and even when it does, it’s just not appealing. I’d really prefer to avoid this one, as there are better adjunct/light lager options out there.","  rDev L: Pale hay color with a couple finger head and no lace. S: Smells like a dirty urinal. T: Follows the nose. F: Thin as water with some carbonation. O: Bud is at least drinkable - this is total swill.","  rDev It has been years, but a special occasion made it readily available.  Poured from a can into a fluted glass. Clear yellow color with a good initial head which faded quickly, a bit of lacing. Slightly lemony sweet smell and taste. Thin feel, of course. Not the worst beer I have had, but it will probably be another special circumstance where I will have another.","  rDev Poured from can into a half pint glass: color is near clear, seriously one of the lightest beers i've ever poured; presents with extreme carbonation touching on sparkling wine. head that presents is bright white but dissipates in seconds.   Smell is so feint, but definitely raw grains and thin sweet water.  Taste is slightly fruity, some malt, some rice water, no hops.  Mouthfeel is extremely carbonated, biting at first, then softens some.  It literally is carbonated barley/rice water, limited flavor, and highly carbonated. American marketing genius at its finest.","  rDev Odd-ish day... powering out some tasks around the abode... 3p rolls around, looking for a snack of sorts, plus refreshment... local bar had wing special, plus this jawn for 1.75 draft... f' it, I bit... draft served first, obviously... clear yellow gold juice, white bread aroma, barely any foam... first sip (and mind you first time having this), clean, animal cracker cereal flavor, light brushing of grassy hop, moderate back blast of seltzer-y carbonation... wings arrived, dry (garlic-parm) and greasy (drenched bbq)... this drop held its own, cut through the baked meatiness... would never feel compelled to buy a 30-12-6, let alone a tallboy amongst the malt-licks, but this wasn't half bad, and worlds better than than f'n swine pus natty ice... tbh, swine pus got more body than NI, and you bet more flava","  rDev Pours a nearly completely translucent straw with a finger of white foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is straw, barley, grain, and play ground pebbles. Flavor profile is straw, barley, lemongrass, herbal hops and corn grain. It's smooth with very little to throw off the balance, then again, there is very little here. Mouth feel crisp with a light effervescence. It has a thin consistency.

Generally flavors follow the nose. Very minimal bitterness. Very refreshing. M: Light bodied with low effervescence. O: Not really designed as a  big flavor  beer, eminently drinkable. Frankly, more flavorful than I though it would be. It is what it is.","  From notes 12/26/11: Pours a pale straw producing a couple of fingers of white loosely bubbled head that leaves little lacing as it recedes. Aroma is grain/cereal, white bread, some grassy and lemon hop hints. Taste is a slightly more robust version of the nose. A good choice if you want a beer, are forced to cut calories and can not get Yuengling Light, or if its free.","  rDev Obviously I've had this shimmering, urine-yellow brew with its large, bright white foam head in the past, and more than I'd have cared to, but I'm not above revisiting even the most offensively pedestrian and bland beverage that I'd never taken the time to make note of until now.   Sitting and pondering this  beer  for only slightly more than the briefest moments I may have before, it's shocking how super sweet it is. Notes of sweet yellow corn guide a crisp effervescence into sweet white grapes as the LIGHT (derp), tinglingly bubbly body finishes semi-wet. This beer brings to mind the fruit juice boxes of the 90s with their indiscernible flavor profiles.  Aside from a faint breadiness, this damn near maltless wonder really is as forgettable and pointless a beer as one can produce, aptly targeting the sugar-conditioned American palate with laser precision and causing bloat around the world due to the need to compensate in quantity for what it lacks in ABV, straight from the container. There's no other reason to drink this beer than to get a buzz or to look like an active participant at a party by holding something in your hand.","  rDev 473 ml can, now unfortunately available in Norway. ABV here is 4.1%. Golden colour, fizzy, moderate head. Surprisingly strong aroma of artifical candy. Fizzy mouthfeel, a little sweetness, no real flavour at all, hardly any traceable hops, no aftertaste. Crap.","  rDev Aroma of watered down malt, cereal, and perhaps some citrus. Taste is weak,non complex,watery. And as it warms it just doesn't taste good. I had this at a party and didn't even finish it, I guess I've become a beer snob but life is too short to drink this","  rDev Rice, musty corn husk, faint malts and weak hops, both in aroma and flavor. Light in color, body and flavor. Active carbonation and dry finish. Sort of.  As boring as this beer is, it serves it purpose. I have had worse.","  rDev 25 ounce can into lager glass, best before 6/27/2018. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/grain and mild earthy hop notes; with poor strength. Taste of cracker, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/grain and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors; with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness of pale malt/grain and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. I liked that they don't use corn, so you don't get much fruitiness. Very clean barley/grain flavors and decent earthy hop presence/balance. An enjoyable offering, and very well made style example as expected. For a light beer expectation, it nails it. A bit lighter bodied than regular, but just as flavorful for the most part.","  rDev Straw filtered with a little carbonation and 3 fingers of white head.  Smells of skunk, card board, beer.  Light and watery with hints of pale, toasted malts, and bread.  Light body, and moderate carbonation.  There's a first time for everything, and at age 44 having tasted and reviewed more than 2,000 different craft beers, I'm tasting this icon. Its all you'd expect, no more.","  rDev Nice safe beer that’s ubiquitous and associated with parties, bars and lounges - drinks smooth and easy but without much flavor, intensity or complexity. Quenches the thirsty when you’re in a pinch but not much else. Faint grain and biscuit notes. Starts off decent carbonated but goes flat by the time you’re done. Slightly sour mouthfeel.","  rDev Anemic pale gold, crystal clear. Some foam initially, that fades away to a still glassy surface and thin ring of skim.   Aroma is bland but fairly inoffensive, faint traces of cracker an apple, and wet soggy grain.   Taste is similar, bland apple ester and feeble  malt beverage  character, gross silage aftertaste. Sharp astringency and aggressive carbonation, watery and insipid, this is where it becomes sourish and offensive. Just about any Euro pale lager is better than this, there's zero hop presence whatsoever.  I'd never buy it since there are almost always better alternatives. On a hot day, in a situation where there wasn't any good beer to be had, I wouldn't be ashamed to drink this on ice for rehydration purposes.

Aroma is sweet caramel malt, slight vanilla hints,with hops being resinous pine and grapefruit among other citrus hints. Taste is cloyingly sweet caramel malt and butter; loosely balanced with mostly resinous pine and to a lesser degree grapefruit/citrus hops with a dry and very bitter finish. Aftertaste is a hop/malt bitter-sweetness that rapidly gravitates to an imperial bitter. A nice example of an American double IPA.","  rDev Bottle dated 050819.Richer, maltier looking beer with very fine suspension and fair carbonation. A thin head.

Aromas of resinous grapefruit, pineapple, and mango are dosed with a lacquered floral tone opening upfront; candied tropical fruits offer a slightly sweeter edge over time, while potpourri and a slight pine and crisp malt backbone reveal themselves further toward the finish.  Taste opens with honeyed orange and grapefruit peel followed by decidedly earthier tones of mango and pine resin on the mid-palate; oaky potpourri and slight caramel malt and citrus esters fade to the finish.  Mouthfeel gives impressions of a medium-heavy body throughout, leveled by a consistent dryness; touches on syrupy at times but is never overly apparent, but does give off a mildly discernable booziness from the mid-palate onward; finish brings a balanced but burly bitterness and a swallow that stifles the boozier elements some.  A sturdy sample of a TIPA that packs its punch while not letting booziness build to anything too cloyingly sweet; nice balance overall with a depth in profile that comes through reasonably well; a reliable (and steadily drinkable) option for the style.","  rDev The 2019 edition, poured into a tulip  Pours orange/amber and slightly hazy with limited head but good lacing.  The aromas are predominantly fruity, at the start, with mango, peach, pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, and white grape, but strong floral notes and a touch of honey are present as well.  The brew hits the tongue with honey and tropical fruit. As the brew crosses the mid-palate, grapefruit flesh and zest provide immediate balance and body, along with some caramel malt. The finish is solidly resin hop--thinking cedar more than pine or spruce--not dank, with some well-hidden but ultimately emerging booze.  The brew is medium to medium-full bodied, but very well carbonated, and the booze helps dry things out.  Overall, another year, another excellent Hoptimum.","  rDev Copper filtered with lots of carbonation and 2 fingers of off white head.  Smells of caramel and evergreen hops, and foam toffee.  Tastes of creme brulee, caramel, and big, bitter hops.  Medium to heavy, syrupy and dank body with moderate carbonation.  Very hoppy, delicious brew.

Drinkability – This is a real sipper, something you will want to drink slowly to appreciate.","  rDev OMFG! How izzit that I have NOT drank, reviewed &amp; rated this beer until now?!? Granted, it only comes in Bottled format, but still, I have had at least one every year since its inception. I must have been drinking them out in town, away from my keyboard, but it is high time to correct that oversight!  From the Bottle:  Distinguished, yet devilishly hoppy ;  Every year, we try to top ourselves by making the hoppiest, most intense and most flavorful IPA we can muster. This year, we chose the most flavorful hops and pushed them beyond their limits in this all-new triple IPA. This reimagined Hoptimum is our hoppiest beer yet, providing a blend of tropical and citrus hop aroma that delivers a refined yet aggressive character. ;  We brew in Chico, CA, and Mills River, NC, to bring you the finest quality beer.   I felt really lucky to score a single bottle of the 2018 Edition &amp; I was anxious to get started, so I  Use[d a] Bottle Opener  on the  Fresh Seal Cap  &amp; began a C-Line pour. It jumped up to greet me like an eager puppy upon its master's return from a day at work! I got just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with good retention that left elegant lacing in its wake. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = &gt; 9, &lt; 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled very tropical with loads of mango, papaya, guava &amp; passionfruit. Mmm. I don't get as excited for Southern Hemisphere hops as I once did, but this set my mouth to watering. Mouthfeel was medium, a little light for this big style. The taste was indicative of what I hope is the coming DIPA trend - a blend of PNW and SoHem hops to offset the (usually) cloying sweetness of the tropical fruitiness with the bitterness from citrusy hops. Here, the tropical fruit salad party was disrupted by the sudden jangly arrival of grapefruit, but the two factions got along well. It was still sweet ... ish, but the bitter citrusiness was not only welcome, but it helped to hold the sweetness in check. Not to be overlooked, the alcohol content cast a fusel heat on the party, reminding the participants to take it easy &amp; NOT to slug it down as though it were nothing. Finish was pleasantly dry &amp; you can bet your bottom dollar that I will be partaking again next year!","  rDev Deep, rich gold color with good white cap and lacing.  Aroma of resin, citrus and a deeper scent I'll call ripe fruit.  Hops are upfront and strong, as expected, yet held together by an invisible cord that keeps the whole hop bundle continuous rather than strands fraying off. I can identify certain hop flavors but indistinctly because each blends with the other so well there is no clear line when one leaves off and another starts. Very complex and dry.  Brewer says hoppy and I believe it, not from bitterness, rather from sheer hop presence. Very complex and balanced with an emphasis on hop levels geared toward the true hop fan.","  rDev 25 Julio 2018. From Decervecitas. In Teku glass. Playing Avadon 3.

Big hop flavors initially, with medicinal and herbal hops joining the thrust and parry of citrus and pine. Alcohol comes on in the second half of the sip but quickly subsides.

Medium bodied with a somewhat syrupy feel and relatively low carbonation.  Solid, but not as transcendent as many of the DIPAs available these days.","  rDev Appearance: Amber brown glass holds a solid half finger of tan head. Several carbonation streams keep it alive.  Aroma: Hop oils, hop leaves, sweet malty base with a little toffee, and more hops. Hops are mostly pine and citric with some earthy notes blended in.   Taste: Heavy malt base struggles to soak up all the hop acids and slowly loses the fight leaving a bitter, almost burning acidic finish. It's glorious, but it requires a bit of sadomasochistic love of intense hop goodness. The base is enjoyable but fleeting, just a thin toffee ribbon in raw hop juice.  Mouthfeel: Bit hot, medium body is a touch thin, oily texture requires a firm swallow, almost a chew. Bit numbing, gritty carbonation.  Overall: Big hop flavors, West coast goodness that I greatly enjoy. Not for everyone, if you are over your hop head days try something else, but if you are looking for a hop fix, this brings an embarrassment of riches.

Obviously, it's well carbonated. It smells fuller than most American adjunct lagers. The malt is easy to find and is quite pleasant. There's a note of hops, too, but they're playing second fiddle. The taste is also much more malty than hoppy, although it's not hoppiless. Overall, it has an earthy and slightly nutty flavor, with a hop bittering at the finish. Although pleasant, that's the only complexity of the taste. Ìt drinks more like a Kolsch than a lager. The mouthfeel is disappointing. With all that foamy head, it drinks surprisingly flat. It's like most of the carbon dioxide went into the head, leaving little left for the beer. The history of this beer is renowned, even by casual drinkers. But, the craft beer phenomenon has made this more of a tradition than a treat.","  rDev Fantastic summer beer here, had on-tap and enjoyed thoroughly; can't believe I've never reviewed this one before. Wonderful malty, mildly nutty and somewhat caramelly lead-in with a light, snappy grassy and earthy hop component that all blend beautifully into a clean and crisp body and finish that doesn't carry a trace of lager-y skunk. Recommended.","  rDev Can from Whole Foods   A clear deep amber with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks solid. The nose is solid. Clean, fresh hops, rather English in character with a spicy, earthy, mildly nutty note along with a toffee, caramel and light butterscotch note. An awesome, delicate fruity character is present. The palate opens bitter and earthy, with a dusty, fruity, mildly sweet flavor combination. Earthy hops, mildly leafy and floral, along with a dry, brown sugar, toffee and butterscotch malt flavor. Fruity yeast on the mid-palate, pairing nicely with the caramel and especially the hops. Drying, creamy, lush on the finish despite the high carbonation. Medium-light in body, the mouthfeel is excellent. This is really good stuff.","  rDev 2020-11-29 12oz can served in a tulip. Date on the can is 040120. I don't remember where I bought this. I've had this before, but it has been many years.  Pours a deep clear amber with a medium sized head. Smell is rich and grainy, honey and bready yeast.  Taste is also rich and grainy with a lot of honey and bready yeast. But, there's also a bit of a bitter bite -- not too much, so maybe more like a nibble, just enough to let you there are teeth here.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, though also surprisingly low on carbonation. Overall, this is a much richer and more interesting beer than it was in my memory. I'm glad I decided to revisit it.","  rDev A - Nice medium to deep amber color with dense off-white creamy foam layered on top. Carbonation is moderate.  S - Nice toasted caramel aroma with a subtle earthy earthiness.  T - Toasted caramel malt from start to finish and a mild earthy citrus on the very back side. Ends slightly on the malty side but has an extremely pleasing finish with a little bit of lingering earthy citrus.  M - Big medium body with very gentle carbonation and a wet finish.  O - This is an enjoyable classic that never gets old, rock solid. Thank you, Fritz Maytag!","  rDev Poured from bottle to spiegelau glass. Amber liquid with a collar of eggshell foam. Aromas of fruit and dark bread, and earthy hops. Fruity, chewy toasted brown bread flavor with herbal/earthy hops.","  rDev Bottled 1/3/20  Another day, another style I haven't tried yet. I've heard this one talked about for a long time as a classic, let's see if it lives up to the hype  Pours a mostly clear orange with 3 fingers of soapy beige head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  The nose here is sweet but balanced. I get lots of honey, lager yeast, mild lemon, doughy malts, and grassy hops  Starting off the flavor, I pick up on present but subtle grassy hops, cut with some general citrus. It trends sweeter when the sip is held in, and especially on the swallow, where the malt comes in with sweet honey and cereal grain, all the while carrying citrus to cut through the sweetness  This has a medium body (heavier than I was expecting for the abv) and light tingly carbonation, leading to a smooth beer, but it feels a tad too heavy. Finishes sticky and wet  This was pretty good, but definitely past freshness for a lager. I'm sure it's better fresh, but I'm not sure by how much. At the very least, it's an easy drinking, affordable lager","  rDev Pours a mostly gear golden color. smell is fruity,with wood and some herbal spices. Taste follows nose with a nice balance of sweetness, fruity mixed in with some bitterness. Mouth feel is medium carbonated and a crisp balanced finish.","  rDev Deep gold/pale amber pour; excellent clarity; off white one inch of creamy head; very good cap retention; heavy ring; medium heavy lacing. Smells like a spicy lager poured into a cup of sandalwood incense. Taste is bready sweet malt/fruity yeast; light bitter green hops and pine; spicy woody backend. Medium light body, moderate carbonation; dry finish. Overall, I don’t like the taste, which reminds me of rancid apple juice; it’s fruity/woody/spicy with a bready base; add some bitter hops to the mix, and I don’t like the overall.","  rDev Pours an amber hue. Lots of caramel and banana candy on the nose. There's a little banana up front but this Common is mostly dry. It's got a little bit of hop character on the finish that isn't the best tasting.","  rDev Bottled 09/26/19 Let warm to 45F +/-. Clear orangey-amber, with moderate white head, that leaves a 1/8  ring , and a little lacing .   Smell is caramel, bready , some fruitiness that's not quite citrus, floral hops, with brief flashes of faint pine solvent.   Taste is fresh white bread crust of the thick &amp; chewy (not dry/flaky) variety, light caramel, with a light mix of floral/pine/citrus rind hop flavor in the latter half of the taste. Those hop flavors are masked somewhat by some moderate pleasant bitterness that comes in at the same time, and lingers awhile.  Feel is light-medium, smooth, with a drying very fine carbonation tingle . A tad light on the carbonation, but only slightly so. If I wasn't reviewing it, I might not notice.  Overall, an easy-drinking, enjoyable, classic , that I'd highly recommend trying at least once. The whole is better than the parts.","  rDev Pours Dark orange with a thin, white head and good carbonation. Lots of carmel malt and breadiness and toast on the nose. Wonderful breadinness, toasted caramel and malt. Some hoppiness on the end. Banana bread like on the end makes this a great taste. Medium mouthfeel. Been wanting to try this for a long time! Uderrated.","  rDev The bottle I have has a label of the San Francisco Bridge. The back of the bottle has:  PKG062519   Appearance: The body is a dark amber to medium bronze. It has good clarity. The head is large, white, and very dense with a rippled surface. It looks perfect.  Aroma: There is a noble hop aroma that is spicy. It has a bit of a candy-like scent which is a bit of a mix of how rock candy smells and a touch of toffee. The hops smell lovely.  Taste: There is a bit of sweet caramel mixed with a light herbal hop flavor. It is slightly floral like a hibiscus. It is very pleasant to drink.  Mouthfeel: It's very smooth with a light bitterness. It has a medium-light body and a wash of carbonation.  Overall: It is simply an enjoyable beer that is also loaded with flavor, aroma, and character. I would recommend giving it a try. I enjoyed it and I would certainly drink it again. The high-point for this beer is how it has a lovely flavor that is a bit sweet and a bit herbal that lingers on the tongue. It's a memorable beer.","  rDev From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.   Light orange color; murky but slightly see through.   Nice off-white head; decent lacing. Slight smoke in the nose; fresh bread as well. Inviting.   Thin mouthfeel.   Taste is predominately of corn, with a smack of hops. Low quality lager comes to mind.   Disappointing after a great nose. Not likely to grab another.","  rDev Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass  A: Pours copper amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.   S: Herbal, grassy, slightly woody, piney, toasty bready malt, and a hint of toffee sweetness.   T: Piney, herbal, grassy, slightly woody, faintly nutty, toasty bready malt, and a hint of toffee.   M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.   O: A craft beer icon that has survived the years for good reason. Not overly complex, but really well balanced and very drinkable.","  rDev 19.2 oz. can. Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 1.5 inch white head over a copper body with some lacing. Very subdued nose of cracker, hay, and slight pine. Taste is very nice and refreshing even though a tad sweet. Sweetness gives way to a bit of hops and a very pleasant, near dry finish. Nice feel and overall, I've had this many times in the late '70's into the '80's and never rated it until now with a proper review. I will be bringing these big cans to the occasional get together in the very near future. Cheers to the Anchor team for this great example of the style!","  rDev Clear and sparkling amber body; slowly rising carbonation; thick and rocky head. Notes of caramel and crystal malt in the aroma; wood and pine. Much like the aroma, lots of mild caramel and spicy, pine resin taste with a well-balanced and subdued bitterness; honey-like. Medium-light in body; a fair amount of residual sugar body; relatively dry overall with some sweetness offsetting things.   An incredibly tasty beer, smooth and malty with a well-balanced hop bitterness.","  rDev Clear copper with a big, dense light khaki head. Awesome retention and lace Deeply malty aroma Rich malty flavor, a bit of caramel, some black currant and herbal hop notes Medium bodied with a clean finish. Satisfying There's a reason why this is still the standard bearer for the style","  rDev -clear, deep amber bottle pour with pale, tan foam cap. The aroma is sweet malt and a bit of char. Caramel malt is the main flavor. The finish is crisp. This is a simple and consistently pleasant pour.","  rDev This was my first Steam Beer and I found it surprisingly nice. I will try a few more of this beer style. As I am cannot say anything about how it matches the style or how it compares to other beers within the style I am just giving my impression with respect to the taste.  Look: Amber, slightly red, with an inch off-white head  Aroma: caramel, toasted bread  Taste: The flavor is malty/sweet, toasted bread, caramel, a moderate bready maybe toasty hop bite at the end.  Body/Overall: medium body, much silkier and thicker than a typical Lager","  rDev I saved this beer for last out of their variety 12er. Definitely not the best from the bunch...  This beer did look beautiful all poured out - clear copper color, creamy head, and even some lacing. But that’s pretty much it for redeeming qualities. Mouthfeel was highly carbonated, the smell was mostly malts and barley, and the taste pretty much was along the same lines. It wasn’t awful, just your run-of-the-mill beer...","  rDev L: Clear filtered copper with rising bubbles and three fingers of beige dense foam and froth. Excellent retention and many spots and diagonal lines of lace.  S: Slightly sweet bready malts, ripe banana when swirling in the glass, and some bittering and herbal hops.  T: Follows the nose. Off-dry and quite malty with a nice bitter bite. Less banana replaced by a little rye on the back end.  F: Medium body, smooth and malty. Nice carbonation, drier finish.  O: The beer is often better from a fresh bottle than on tap. I have stopped ordering on tap. I nice easy drinker that I am occasionally missing enough to pick up. Beats most others I've tried of the style.","  rDev Pours a medium amber, coppery coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is pretty subdued, with some faint doughy, caramel malt and a certain floral note coming through. Taste follows the nose, with a somewhat faint, but well balanced interplay of doughy, caramel, lightly toasted malt and grassy, floral, lightly herbal hops and mild notes of red berries. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some toasted grains lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This kind of reminds me of an Amber Ale Light and I quite like that in a way. It may lack a strong, assertive flavor profile, but has a very nice, subtle balance to it. Very nice in an old school kinda way.","  rDev 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter glass.  A: Fairly small tiny bubbled white head that settles to barely a film. Body is a slightly hazy gold light amber.  S: Light floral hops and a little pepper give way to a lot of toasted malts and breadiness. A very light caramel back.  T: Fairly Light lots of nice light toasted grains and malts finishes very clean.  M: Light crisp and good carbonation. Hardly any lingering after taste.   O: very nice beer easy to drink with a nice breadth toasted taste throughout.","  rDev Pours a clear deep amber color with a one inch slightly off white head that is very well retained but leaves almost no lacing. Smells of roasted malts, caramel, light hop presence and bread. Tastes of lightly toasted bready malts, caramel, slightly bitter hop bite and an earthy presence. Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation smooth mouth feel.","  rDev Nice amber color, with adequate foamy head. Rich flavor and nice finish. I had always heard about Anchor Steam during the days when American macro-brews ruled, now I know why! A reputation well deserved","  rDev Nice easy-to-drink lager but a little disappointing considering the hype. Nice amber color with thick white foamy head, some nice lingering lacing. Smells faintly of malt and grain, tastes similarly although there is a hint of bitterness at the finish. Mild thin mouthfeel, slight lingering bitterness. Decent amount of carbonation.","  rDev ** 04/24/2018  Bottle to goblet.   LOOK: Maize color, clear, medium white head.  AROMA: rice, barley, mild hops. solid old fashioned beer smell. TASTE: mostly malty cereal, with touches of mild fruit (apple?), wood, hay. FEEL: light bodied, good carbonation.  A quality classic brew that has lasted through the decades; just falls a hint beneath current expectations.  **"]},{"Name":"Sculpin - Grapefruit","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/199/89174/","Brewery":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.00,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev Canned 3/10/21  As mentioned in my Sculpin review (last night), this was also one of the first beers that got me into the craft scene. Thusly, I never got around to actually reviewing it. At the time I just knew that I liked it, but couldn't articulate what about it I liked. Finally, 3 years later it's getting an actual review. Let's dive right in  Pours a cloudy amber gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  Obviously some hops can give off a pithy grapefruit character, but it's easy to tell that it's just straight up grapefruit used in this one. I'm picking up on aromas of fresh ruby grapefruit, bready malt, white pepper, earthy hops, and light pineapple  In the OG, the aroma is far superior to the taste. Here, they meet in the middle and equalize, matching each others intensity. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, sweeter grapefruit juice, grassy hops, bready malt, and light lemon. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, orange rind, bready malt and light pine  A light medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet biting beer. Finishes mostly dry without much sweetness  It's good, great even. But it doesn't match the smoothness of the original. Definitely a worthy variant and it stands on its own as a good beer","  rDev 12oz can. Can bottom is stamped 'PKG 15MAR21'. Clear, deep gold colored body. One thin finger of white head. Leaves behind spots and trails of lacing. Aroma of citrus (lots of grapefruit) and piney hops, with a sweeter malt base. When the nose is taken away from the glass, the grapefruit is picked up again. Taste is grapefruit citrus, resin, and piney hops. Good honey malt base. The hops yield a classic bitterness. The hops and some sweetness linger into the aftertaste. Just about medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation. Very clean in expression. Really a solid example of the West Coast IPA, and the grapefruit adds positively to the bitterness angle. This remains a classic beer recipe.","  rDev Appearance: clear, bright golden coloring, gorgeous snow-white head stands tall atop and stays awhile.  Aroma: Grapefruit screams out of the glass and tears into the nose. Quite potent grapefruit-y aromas. Anything else? If there are, I can't hear them under all the grapefruit.  Taste: Boom! Grapefruit, with beer below it. The Sculpin IPA is here, but it's subtleties and nuances are fairly drowned out by the grapefruit. Other citrus notes and piney flavors can be felt but barely, here and there. Bitterness is all over it, but it's not devastating, it can be smooth and mildly exit the palate.  Another sip and there it is, the big splash of grapefruit, the easy, biscuit-y malt, the aggressive hop attack that's so friendly to my tongue.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.0%. Deep golden colour, large white head. Aroma of grapefruit and pine. The flavour is distinctly hoppy throughout, like the  normal  Sculpin, but with the grapefruity and piney notes from the hops enhanced by added grapefruit. Good stuff.","  rDev Clear yellow/amber. on tap in pint glass.  Grapefruit and tangerines, with the piney hop bitterness as well in smell.  The taste is primarily grapefruit juice.  Medium balanced consistency.  Drinkable in a basic way.  Personally I am not a fan. I may be a purist but I feel a talented brewer could make hops alone taste and smell like citrus fruit. This tastes like they dumped juice in it and overdid it. (The base sculpin ipa is a winner, I gave that a 4.57 back in the day)","  rDev (12 oz can, PKGD 22JUL19; purchased off shelf... poured into Belhaven pub pint)  L: crystal-clear, yellow-orange liquid; foam fizzled down posthaste... razor-thin collar; no lace  S: pine in the back, but all grapefruit juice up front - doesn't smell like an IPA, more like a Pellegrino; nice, but faux...   T: lots of grapefruit; back end bitterness rather pithy, but propelled by grapefruity (I'm assuming), peppery, spicy, piney hops... bit of a lithe, toasty, caramelled-grain underbelly, giving it at least a little contrast... stridently dynamic taste, but too heavy on its 'natural flavors'  F: light-bodied, glassy, spritzy... thin, silky resins giving it a little texture, but not much... for an IPA of this abv though, excellent sharp cuts and contours, though perhaps a touch too streamlined  O: alas, an elusive, sort-of-recent packaging.; kept finding year-old bottling, the rare times I was looking for this.. I don't normally go after flavored IPAs - simply checking off a box here... people must love this, otherwise, why bother with this crap? - wasn't that juice-infused IPA thing awhile back?... not a bad drink, but very much prefer base-Sculpin over this any day; this is a f'n boozy soft drink - an IPA/Pellegrino shandy (1446)","  rDev 5/8/19 (Chicago): $6.00 plus tax pint pour at Edison Park Inn.Bronze draft 16 oz pour into pint glass, light pinky sized head dissipates quickly. Light grapefruit and hops aroma. Taste similar to aroma, nice blended hops and fruity taste, grapefruit strong and pleasant. Light mouth feel and carbonation, easy drinking. Overall nice offering.","  rDev Bottled fall 2014; drank 10/29/14 &amp; the Yarchives.   Clear, bright orange liquid.   Big off-white head; frothy lace.   Fresh grapefruit nose.   Thin mouthfeel.   Tart grapefruit juice flavor; if it weren't for the thin mouthfeel this would be tough to drink. A bone dry finish.   Not awful, but not what I want in an IPA.","  rDev I can't believe it's taken me so long to get to this IPA...  ...Well, the more I think about it I do. You see, the last BP offering I had, their cream ale, tasted like a liquid ash tray and it just turned me sour on BP ever since. It's been a few years, I was feeling the holiday spirit so I picked up this IPA as I have hear it's pretty go - and whaddaya know - it is. Great clear and effervescent coloration, decent lacing. The smell is sweet and full of grapefruit, which is what I can say about the taste - a punch of puckering grapefruit. Mouthfeel is more carbonated than I prefer but lightly bodied and crisp. This lives up to the hype and sometimes good things do come to those who wait...or procrastinate...","  rDev 12 oz bottle from a six pack purchased at the LCBO; bottled Aug 8 2018 and served slightly chilled.  Pours with a golden orange-colour and a foggy, translucent body that is capped off with one finger of loose, off white froth. It fizzles off within a couple of minutes, scattering a modest amount of lacing about as it recedes down to a soapy collar; looks fine to me. It smells mainly of pine and resiny hop oils, with a strong undercurrent of grapefruit juice. Maybe a hint of honey, orange peel and light cereal grain sweetness in there too, but it's a pretty one-dimensional aroma - though I do like grapefruit, so I'm certainly not complaining.  Delicious stuff. The grapefruit is front and center throughout the sip, buoyed at first by a subtle grainy pale malt backing that soon gives way to juicy orange and grapefruit citrus, as well as peach and apricot. A pithy bitterness asserts itself nearer the finish, becoming more resiny and earthy at its conclusion. Medium in body, with middling carbonation levels that provide a proper bite to what is actually a rather slick, persistent mouthfeel. Fantastically easy to toss back - I rationed these six bottles out over the course of two weeks, but I could've easily knocked 'em back in a night (with the right motivation).  Final Grade: 4.25, an A-. I drink a hell of a lot of IPAs. I've tried so many that it has gotten to the point where genuinely impressive ones are becoming harder to come by - and that is why experiences like Grapefruit Sculpin remain so delightful to my senses. This was priced a few bucks higher than the average (imported American) sixer in this market, but as long as they can keep a fresh supply coming I think they'll have plenty of takers in Ontario - I'll certainly be back for more, and I'd love to see more BP stuff crop up in these parts in the future.","  rDev 355 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchase came out to $3 CDn per bottle, but it's not often that we get SoCal IPA's available in this neck of the woods.  Appearance - Hazy rich golden / amber colored brew. Two plus fingers of super light off-white head sit on top. Good staying power and lots of visible carbonation. Spotty lacing at the edges of the glass.  Smell - Plenty of grapefruit initially with some minerally aspects and subtle earthiness in behind. But, mostly it's grapefruit, grapefruit and more grapefruit.  Taste - Tons of grapefruit, fairly intense bitterness, lots of pith, with some leafiness. Transitions to a little sweeter mid sip with healthy malt bill and a touch of other tropical fruits, think melon and cantaloupe, but first and foremost the taste is about grapefruit. Lemon zest too at the end.  Mouthfeel - Slick and sticky, fairly heavily bodied, approaching DIPA level of this, but a fizzy body relaxes the tongue and mouth and makes this an easy beer to drink.  Overall - Certainly one of the best IPA's I've had this year and stacks up pretty damn close to it's prodigious reputation.","  rDev On tap at Albertsons. True to its name, big citrus aroma and taste (yellow grapefruit). Normal body with decent fluffy head. Goes down exceptionally easy for 7%.","  rDev A little disappointing given the high reviews already given. Very grapefruit-forward. Nice golden color, moderate carbonation and mild head that lingered. Smelled of citrus and grapefruit. Tasted of malt, floral and fruity hops, grapefruit, orange zest. Thin mouthfeel, slightly bitter grapefruit aftertaste. I actually prefer the Sculpin IPA.","  rDev Beautiful rose gold color with white cap and lacing.  Grapefruit grows on trees so it's a flowering fruit and I don't know what grapefruit flowers smell like but that's what I'm reminded of here. An aroma of bright, flowery citrus hops with a definite grapefruit hit.  Flavor is well defined among the hops in a way that is less sharp yet richer than the regular Sculpin. There is more of a malt presence than the regular Sculpin as well though not enough to compete with the hops, just support them.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.  Overall it seems a bigger yet more refined version of the regular Sculpin. I can't say this is just the regular with grapefruit added, it's something more, rounder, smoother (that word again) with a bigger room presence. Stream fishermen are familiar with stream bed stones that have tumbled around for thousands of years becoming rounded down and worn smooth. That's what I mean by smooth, an absence of jagged edges. This is a round stone beer that's strong enough (7%) to be pushy but isn't and hoppy enough to be brash yet it's not. A beer of substance and manners that simply sits down and joins the conversation like a genial, good humored friend.","  rDev 12 oz bottle  appears clear, orange golden in color, white head. fruity grapefruit aroma, very citrusy. taste is fruity too, but nice underlying bitterness. thin to medium bodied.","  rDev Taste: tangy super dry, grapefruit juice, semi sour, bitter citrus hops. Fresh squeezed Grapefruit juice, tart, and some dry hopped nose. Gold, mostly clear, tall white foam head. Medium body. Lots of people lick this sour bitter but one glass is enough for me. 70 IBUs","  rDev Pours a cloudier version of regular sculpin, a little bit orange with plenty of that grapefruit zested skin floating throughout the beer. Aroma smacks less of the dry hopping and more of the old school grapefruit C hop bitter kick.  Taste, yeah, this obscures what made Sculpin great. Instead of being that beer that first dropped other hop flavors than grapefruit and pine, this one reverts back to a substantial amount of grapefruit that obscures everything else. Forget any notions of other jucier and more flavorful citrus or tropical fruit. The body is still relatively drinkable, but not as dry somehow. I dunno, I just file this in the long line of beers that fall under the  hoppy beer they made worse by dummying it up with fruit like adjunct.

Sweet grapefruit flavor, great balance between hops/malt...medium-low to medium bitterness with a pleasant linger. Mouthfeel is just right, again...everything in balance. Tasty and crushable.","  rDev Poured into a shaker pint glass: color is straw gold, head is presented 1/2 inch thick with mixture of small/fine bubbles, head is off white.  Smell is fresh scraped grapefruit rind, bitter, pleasant, sour and enticing.   Taste is similar: bitter grapefruit rind, some malt, toast, background hops of lemon, earth, herbal.  Mouthfeel is bitter, but plays well for the style and additions  Overall, a great addition to a great beer, grapefruit is real tasting without any odd off notes.","  rDev Light amber appearance with one finger white head and plenty of carbination.

Very refreshing combination.","  rDev L - Bronze/ copper with a little bit of clarity. 1 finger of head and lots of lacing left all over the glass. Gorgeous beer  S - Grapefruit, X 100. Wow.

Swallow is more juicy grapefruit and pithy hops with some lingering sweetness. M: This beer is on the lighter side of medium in body with slightly prickly carbonation and an oily hop finish  O: Overall this is one of the best IPAs out there. Great flavors and complexity with the grapefruit really bringing all the citrus to the forefront. Definitely one to grab if you see it.","  rDev Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Cycle Brewing pint glass.  A: Pours a very clear gold, with average visible carbonation and a two finger white head that has great retention. A very pretty beer.  S: Grapefruit – pink and sweet. Light cracker malts. Simple but nice - big grapefruit for sure.  T: Ruby red grapefruit juice with a touch of bitter rind. Pale cracker malts. Finishes with more pulpy grapefruit juice flavor. Remains relatively lightly bitter for an IPA - about the bitterness of unsweetened grapefruit juice.  M: Light body, carbonation sensation on the low side, and the alcohol is quite well-hidden.  O: I thought this was a really tasty beer...but you gotta like grapefruit and grapefruit juice to get into this one. There isn't much else going on here.","  rDev I bought a bottle of this off the single shelf at the local Meijer. It poured a clear copper with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is grapefruit. The taste is bitter leaning but easy to drink. There was grapefruit present throughout. The Mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.","  rDev DATE: October 21, 2016... OCCASION: watching the Hamilton special on PBS with the family... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... a robust orange amber body raises confident bubbles at a constant rate... the two-finger head is thick, white, and lacing like a picket fence of cloud cover... yes, the grapefruit is the soup du jour, but a refreshing sense of lemon, an earthiness and flowery uplift that is winning... sweetness comes in an undercurrent of bread malts... mouth feel is incredibly sessionable, medium-bodied, active at the teeth but balanced enough... the aftertaste is ebullient, with plenty of staying power... flavor profile includes the aforementioned grapefruit, with lemon, orange, bread, and earthy hops... the much lauded Sculpin is given a fruity, Pacific island kind of feel, with enough strength to create a buzz after only a few... does not disappoint...","  rDev Serving: Can Canned: Jul-27-2016  This is a tasty, easy drinking summery beer. Perfect for a swimming pool or camping. I am usually not much for fruit in beers, but this and other similar beers are making me re-evaluate that stance as the fruit adds complexity rather that sweetness/juicyness. It still takes center-stage in my opinion, but at least it is a little subdued. The fruit is definitely there, but it blends well enough with the hops that it just adds a crisp, fruity layer. Citrusy, pine-spicy hops with an oily grapefruit aromatic character that makes it a little fresher than regular Sculpin. Both the flavor and aroma have a hearty biscuit character that was nice, but I think mainly due to the age of the can. As it warmed the sweetness of the juice (or pulp or whatever) came out more, which wasn't my favorite combined with the malt. Regardless, I would imagine that with hops that popped a touch more this would something even more special. Crystal clear copper, soapy head, very drinkable, refreshing. I would have this one again, but I definitely still prefer regular Sculpin.","  rDev Copper filtered with a pink tinge, topped with 4 fingers of glass white head.

Medium body, light syrup quality, lots of tannic, drying qualities,moderate carbonation.  Got at Whole Foods in Davis, California, Sept 19th, 2016. Drank in the wee hours of the 20th. Great floral and hoppy flavours. I think this one is slightly old, but still very tasty.","  rDev On tap at Verona Inn. An interesting rendition of the style given that the original Sculpin was such a hit. The grapefruit isn't as apparent as one might think, although the flavor is certainly enjoyable and thirst quenching. Citrus apparent throughout. Good stuff.

It has a white head with very good head retention.   Smell: It has grapefruit and citrus flavors. There is a low grassy element to it with slight yeast and some earthly notes.   Taste: It has strong citrus flavors with grapefruit. There are doughy flavors after the initial flavor which is strong in the finish. There are some earthen flavors and lemon as well.   Feel: It has a medium body with a hoppy bitter, but not harsh finish.   Overall, it's has plenty of flavor with citrus, grapefruit and lemon being the strongest up front and dough and earth finishing it off.","  rDev Pours a golden orangish hue, hazy but not in a thicc boi way. Some tropical candy on the nose. It's fine. There is a tropical fruit note but it's nothing special. Just fine.","  12oz can. Can bottom is stamped 'PKGD ON 03/04/21'. Slightly cloudy, pale gold colored body. Good show or rising bubbles. Pours a fat finger of white head which recedes slightly but maintains a thick cap. Good coverage of lacing bands. Aroma is strong with citrus hops but maintains some degree of wheat florals. Taste is a balanced blend of citrus hops and wheat malt notes. The entire taste profile is wrapped up rather tightly, but still expressive. Softer and medium plus mouth feel. Tang from both the citrus and from the wheat. Very good carbonation. Not a traditional wheat beer but well balanced with hops included in the recipe. Some dryness at the end but still extremely easy to drink and repeat. View this as a custom beer and not built to  factory  spec.","  rDev Finally got my hands on it. I've been wanting to try it for a very long time. Basically going back to when Three Floyd's blew up on the scene all those years ago... Six pack in cans.  PKG: on 2/11/21 opened and reviewed on 3/9/21  Totally clear golden color with a very full, off-white foam cap. Seafoamy. Sticky lace and full coverage throughout.   The nose is rather remarkable for a wheat based beer. Spicy golden wheat and earthy/citrus toned hops pop right out. Herbal and ok'd spices with a nice hop kick, oh yeah!   Oh damn. Well, it certainly was the worth the wait. The first sip is full of very earthy, crispy wheat malt..with more earthy tones popping out of the hops. Clean and crisp feel makes this hard to put down for very long. Earthy, mild citrus, pine and spice in these hops is very impressive.   The best part is how easy something so complex (for a wheat Pale ale) is so damn easy to pound. I really needed a little break from the fat, juicy hazy NE hop bombs, and this just hit that spot.","  rDev Fairly clear golden body, with less haze than I expected; head fomed nicely and left spongy lacing on the glass. Nose brings a mix of floral notes with wheat-influence, as well as some herbal hop notes. Taste has an opening sweetness that power of suggestion has a brief hint of hard pink bubblegum. The herbal notes come forward fairly quickly, though.  I came at this more as an APA than a wheat beer, and wasn't disappointed. Some wheat aspects come through, but it works just fine as an APA to me.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  PKGD ON 02/11/21 Q0282   Appearance: The body is a neutral gold color that stays consistent in color throughout. It has just a light bit of haze and a medium-large white head. The head has a stucco consistency with good retention and some nice slopes of lacing.  Aroma: Garlic and rosemary crackers come to mind immediately. It smells a lot like a herb multi-grain water cracker. A light bit of alcohol comes through.  Taste: Up front there is garlic and rye bread. Towards the middle there is a hop bine oil character mixed with rye flour and garlic. Towards the back of the palate and on the finish there's a wheat character that comes in.  Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Mild bitterness. Easy to drink.  Overall: The flavors come across as herbal crackers and multi-grain bread. It favors the savory and slightly earthy aromas and flavors. If that sounds like something you're interested in then I'd recommend grabbing a single and trying it out. It's tasty enough that I could drink it again from time to time but it wouldn't be something I would pick up regularly.","  rDev Light and fluffy, slightly juicy, very smooth, whiff of citrus on the nose with some pith and zest - melon and banana sweetness underscores the wheat and tang - very drinkable and refreshing...","  rDev Canned 9/17/20  Back again with some 3 Floyd's action, I've had this one in the fridge for a few weeks now and it probably would have been best to drink it when I got it, seeing as it was canned 3 months ago. I can only imagine that their take on a pale wheat beer will be quite hoppy, and that should lead to some interesting results  Pours a mostly clear yellow gold with 2 fingers of white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  The aroma brings forth notes of equally soft and spicy wheat, lemon peel, orange, grassy hops, and a soft doughy malt  The front end brings flavors of pillowy wheat, orange, banana, and a touch of pepper. On the swallow, things trend a tad spicier, with the grassy and somewhat oily hops matching the earthy wheat along with some cleanly bitter tart grapefruit  A light medium body pairs with effervescent carbonation for a very refreshing beer. Finishes mostly dry and with a nice balance between all elements  A damn good beer, certainly the best pale wheat I've ever had! 3F never lets me down, and I'm once again reminded how lucky I am that they start distributing to my area","  rDev Pours clear amber big fluffy head with soapy lacing Aroma is citrus rind and a hint of lemon. A bit of roasted wheat Taste is citrus and lemon and a tad earthy  Mouth feel is crisp and clean, on the high side of medium carbonation. Fairly smooth a with a tickle of astringent feel on the tongue type of finish Overall it’s a very refreshing easy drinking type of wheat beer.","  rDev From the can, it pours a clear straw color. The head is quite large and retains well.  The nose opens with citrusy notes of orange and tangerine. Aromas of bubblegum pervade, supposedly reflecting the beers name. The malt aroma is bready and wheat like.  Soft and creamy wheat backbone supports hops and yeast flavors. Citrusy notes of grapefruit, orange and tangerine along with lots of bubblegum flavor. A malty sweet is contrasted with a light touch of earthy bitterness and lightly peppery flavors.   Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is moderate to gentle.  A pleasant and easy to drink wheat beer. I will be having this again.","  rDev 12oz can poured into a snifter.  A: Clear and bright amber/orange, trending toward sunny. Tiny-bubbled white head settles into a thin slip after a bit. Spotty and patchy lacing.  S: Bright nose features citrusy hop notes of lemon, lots of fresh orange zest, a touch of melon rind, and slight dank/catty and grassy undertones. Bit of a gummy bear impression too. Very soft toast and shredded wheat aromas coming from the grain bill.   T: Follows the nose. Gummy bears in a big way on the attack. Bright citrus zest notes of lemon and orange. Starfuit too. Very mild bitterness. Catty dankness and clipped grass on the mid-palate, but it’s pretty tame. Very mild toast and shredded wheat grain base. Long citrusy and grassy finish.  M: Medium-Light body. Fluffy and airy texture. Crisp and well carbonated. Very malt hop astringency.   O: Now THIS is a beer that’s built to drink, if you know what I mean. Light in body and not at all filling, crisp and easy. Quenching and quaffable. The dominant citrus and gummy fruit flavors are pleasant and easygoing too. Just a really tasty and fun beer to drink. I recommend you jump in at a twelve pack. You won’t regret it.","  rDev A: Pours a yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves decent lacing  S: Wheat, citrus, and floral notes up front along with some lighter bread and grain  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of citrus and floral hops and then picks up the wheat and some perfumey notes. Bitterness balances the malt sweetness. Finishes with lingering light bitterness and citrus peel  M: Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A solid American pale wheat beer that is super easy to drink and fairly well balanced. Worth a drink","  rDev Almost clear, golden to light amber, with a short-lived, dense, off-white head. The head becomes translucent as it settles to a thick, bubbly ring, leaving sticky lace on a PBGC Pub Pint glass.  The aroma opens with delicate grains, light nutmeg, and a touch of honey. Slight warmth reveals Juicy Fruit gum and caramel malt.  Light hop bitterness is overshadowed by malt. Caramel and sour dough bread are prominent. The finish is long and mild, with just a touch of astringency.  The body is medium to light, with a cotton texture and light carbonation. Alcohol is as expected.  Perhaps this beer needs to be consumed fresher than the four-week old can I had. Still, while nothing like my expectations, it is a tasty and enjoyable experience.","  rDev This one pours a clear, just a touch hazy, golden yellow color, with a fluffy head, and lots of lacing.  This smells like lemon, wheat, grassy hop bitterness, and grapefruit.  This has always been considered one of the classic hoppy American wheat beers. You shouldn't go into this expecting a massive hop bomb, but you also shouldn't expect a traditional wheat beer. It doesn't quite have the creaminess of full bodied taste of a hefeweizen, more of just a light lemony and crisp wheatiness. There's some nice hop flavor laid on top here. Amarillo is a good choice, adding grapefruit, light orange, and a clean grassy hop bitterness.  This is light bodied, clean and crisp, with a good mouthfeel and drinkability.  This might have been some sort of revolutionary stuff when it came out over 15 years ago. As of now, it's just a solid little beer.","  rDev 3rd from 3 Floyds which is now sold at WFM in 07701. 3 Floyds deservedly well loved. a) Slight hazy golden body with a thick foam white head that lasts and laces.  s) Hop lemon zest flowers over yeasty wheat french bread. t) Hops like IPA, lemon flowers and zest, some bubble gum, and french bread baking. f) Tingly, clean, juicy, silky.  o) Sum greater than the parts, lovely easy summer drinker. Could be a regular.","  rDev A: Poured a bright canary gold from the can. Really attractive color and a quick forming, frothy white head. I wouldn't call it magnifying glass clear as there's a frosted like haze.  S: Clean citrus and floral hop aroma. Minimal Belgian yeastiness. Sweet buns, lemon poppy seed muffin.   M: Mild carbonation with a supersoft, pillowy body and a nice crisp finish makes it too easy to reach for the next sip.   T/O: Tangerine, orange peel, a hint of caramel and medium bready sweetness. Sweetened chamomile tea, lemon shortbread. Zebra fruit stripe gum. This beer has the taste of pure nostalgia for me.  Not the most complex beer with the most assertive flavor. But it is a very well-rounded beer in that I don't think I'd get tired of it drinking through a 6-pack. The color and mouthfeel are phenomenal. While the taste isn't world-shattering I might not have tasted better in this style, which is why I boost up the overall score.","  rDev L:. Pours a clear straw gold yellow color with a medium white head and a few fingers of lacing on the glass.  S:. Fresh wheat bread notes of a strong citrus hop, and little bit of floral hops.  T:. Strong ripe citrus, a bit of pine, wheat and some floral hops. This is a hoppy wheat beer.  F:. Smooth carb, lighter body.  O:. This is a hoppy but easily drinkable wheat beer.","  rDev Six-pack copped from Bottle King in Livingston. Pours a golden, straw-colored hue with moderate frothing. Very assertive aroma replete with notes of lemongrass and coriander. Similar overall flavor profile.","  rDev This is a beer I have been looking forward to trying for a while. I found it, along with many other things, at Belmont Party Supply in Dayton. Huge white head and translucent golden body. Nose is sweet and tasty but not strong.   Solid hop presence for this style that really guides the flavor. There is some tropical fruit and sweet wheat notes, along with herbal and grassy qualities that add complexity and balance but not anything else to the very dainty texture. This is a brew with few flaws, and worth the wait. Among the finest ever for this style for me.","  rDev a: pretty clear golden amber color with a large frothy 3-4 finger frothy off-white head  s: sweet lemongrass and wheat. pepper spice, tangy citrus and grapefruit. a touch of bubblegum and banana. some bread crust in the background  t: big notes of wheat here with some slight bubblegum. a touch of lemon grass and sweet lemons. hay, and clove with a moderate bready backbone  m: medium mouthfeel with low-moderate carbonation  o: not bad for the style. it's a bit basic, but well-crafted. very easy to drink on a hot day","  rDev 4/1/20...clear bright gold with a touch of white foam on the top.

Delicious  hop armpit  smell. Easy to drink despite the agressive hopping, the drinkability being the only thing here keeping it from being an IPA (in my eyes). Tastes even better as it warms, it gets juicier and the wheat shines through the heavy hopping  Glad to finally try this","  rDev Bottle courtesy of JonnyHops.  From brewery.  Just can’t get past the mouthfeel. Should be smooth with wheat but feels like drinking saliva.","  rDev 12 ounce can into a tulip snifter. Canned 10/23/19, had 1/7/20.  Pours a nice looking, slightly hazy golden yellow with a one inch foamy head. Aroma is lots of citrus, especially orange and lemon, and a good deal of wheat. An herbal hop aroma shows as it warms. The flavor is also citrus and wheat, although the citrus is not as defined, with a slight dankness on the finish. Good amount of herbal and floral hop bitterness throughout. Smooth, good lighter body, well carbonated.  Admittedly, this is not at the top of my style list, but it’s a well made, hoppy wheat beer. Great balance between the citrus/hops and the wheat. Enjoyable.","  rDev Pours a hazy dirty straw color with about a half finger of head. The nose has a sweet fruity essence. The wheat definitely comes out in the flavor profile along with a sweet note in the back ground. The finish has some decent hoppiness.  This is a solid offering. But, considering the amount of hype around this beer (and the price tag), I will pass in the future.   Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is far superior and cheaper.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 2/23/19, so over 6 months old here. Re-reviewed on 9/13/19, after several more from the same six pack produced different views precipitated by a gentler pour.  Crystal clear golden yellow body with good streams of carbonation. Big foamy white head persists and retains well throughout, leaving some nice lacing   Aromas of hay, and faintly lemon.  Clean refreshing taste, with a little slightly sour wheatiness towards the end. It's yeasty, with a touch of lemon. Also on the dry side   Mouth around medium, finish yeasty, dry, and somewhat sour   Overall, a refreshing and enjoyable beer the third or fourth time around. It seems a careful pour avoiding the sediment did the trick for me.","  rDev Poured from a bottle: Straw in color with a small head and some lacing. Smells of grain, malt and citrus. Citrus, grass and bread in the flavor ending with a hint of lemon.","  rDev (12 oz bottle,bottled 02-22-19; purchased shelf single at Shangy's... poured into a Belhaven pub pint)  L: pale yellow-gold liquid, mild-moderate haze; firm, frothy mattress of white suds holding steady... left behind last 1/2  in bottle (saw sediment hanging about)... with a few oz left in the pint, did pour in the sediment, and it became slightly cloudier, that's all... fantastic foam  S: delicate grapefruit essence atop cereal maltiness... fair pop of lemon rind in the background, maybe a soft lemon tart pastry angle... aromas are densely layered (hops especially), but muddled; overall potency/vibrancy: fair+  T: clean, bready malt wash up front, hops merely adding subtle color (flowery, pithy), but the finish is fantastic, with a vibrant, fresh (vaguely sourdough) bread flavor, especially on the first sip... not sure the age on this, in regards to the hops maybe dying out, but the contrast and balance and flavor combos right now are excellent... with the sediment in, subtle earthy color only compliments and enhances the overall taste  F: altogether light-bodied, mellow in booze, softly carbonated, but with the slightest bit of a greasy pancake-batter drag to its flow... I could drink this in liters; so easy, on point; ideal for a domestic wheat  O: sought this for a long time, but I didn't try it for some reason (???) the only time I made it to FFF in IN back in 2014... not what I expected (its name has long conjured up more hefeweizen-y visions)... but one of the more instantly memorable, enjoyable American-style pale wheat beers I've tried... the modest haul I took from my first visit to Shangy's turned out some colossal duds (freshness, or lack there of), but this was a treat! (1428)","  rDev Pours a crystal clear bright yellow with a thick white head. So-so retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is mild citrus fruits. Flavor is a much bolder taste of the nose, sweet citrus up front, biscuit and a nice touch of hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is light bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall a fantastic thirst quencher.","  rDev Bright golden amber, crystal clear, strong rush of bubbles to the top after the pour, settling down to a moderate to light carbonation, tall, white, fluffy, and creamy head, dropping slowly and leaving gobs of sticky, stringy lacing.  Lively aroma of citrus: lemon, grapefruit, orange peel. After a bit, the grainy malts and wheat come through as well.  Substantial wheat and grainy malts in the flavor, with a crisp citrus and lemon from the hops. While hoppier than a Belgian witbier (this is an American Pale Wheat, after all, from 3 Floyds, so what do you expect?), the hops are not overbearing, but are well balanced. Interesting interplay between the wheat and the hops gives this beer and excellent, crisp, summer flavor. No bitterness at all. The finish has a subtle sweetness, coating the tongue, leaving behind a nice lemony citrus aftertaste.  Mouthfeel has a medium body with subdued carbonation.   Overall, an excellent summer beer, easy drinking, refreshing, with an enjoyable, multifaceted flavor."]},{"Name":"Indian Brown Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/1161/","Brewery":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","Style":"Brown Ale - American","Alcohol":7.20,"Score":91.0,"Comments":["  rDev Brown hue.

This brew has the look of cola,not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness. Then sweet earthy roasted grains and malts. There is also a nice sweetness to this brew. Between the look and smell this is one inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with Roasted Hoppy Flavors. Reminds me more of a porter, than an IPA. It is also really hard to pick up on the 7.20% ABV in this American IPA, it is just that smooth. The body of Indian Brown Dark IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Sweet, Roasted, Smooth, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Indian Brown Dark IPA a 4.50 out I 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, did a super nice job with this brew. If you are a fan of dark brews you should look this one up.","  rDev At 50 IBU, this pushes my comfort level...but I think this crafty combination of styles makes me comfortable. If you accept that Dogfish Head combines three styles, Indian Brown is unique... and pleasantly so.  It certainly Looks like a Brown (or a Scots ale). The Smell also could be either style... except even I detect the hops. Tastes cascade starting with the dark malts balanced by the hops sweetened by the brewers sugar and then, inexplicably, finishes dry. I only give a great crafter this many points for their hoppy beer.  This might be a good ale for hop-heads to appreciate sweet browns.","  rDev From a growler via Jungle JIm's Eastgate in a snifter. This fine ale pours a rich ruby tinged brown with a fantastic head of off white foam that settles to a  thick ring, thin light pool, and showcases some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of  light cocoa, subtle citrus notes of orange zest, light brown sugars, and light  piney hops. Flavors exceed the nose with caramel and brown sugar touched with orange zest and light peach notes touched with bread crust and awash  in herbal and light pine tinged hop flavors that balance out the malty characteristic of the ale. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light carbonation that is  perfect and quaffable for the style, and a lightly hop touched malt finish.  The best parts of two styles in one....NICE.

Drinkable and tasty.","  rDev What a surprise - not at all what i was expecting...  From the brewer I think is one of those that know how to put out an IPA, here's thing they advertise as a dark ale, really a brown ale, and has the muted flavor of an IPA. Speaking of muted - the only thing muted about this beer was it's smell. The scent was a muted blend of caramel and malts, with none of the hoppy background you would expect. The look is dark brown, decent head, and very, very good lacing. Mouthfeel was very full-bodied, definitely carbonated, but still a great smoothness across the tongue. The taste was distinctively malty right out of the bottle, but after it settled in the glass, the hoppy character made itself known and it was also distantly sweet. Overall, I found this to be definitely exceptional.","  rDev 12oz bottled 9/29/17 poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours very dark brown with only the slightest red hue if held to light. The head is tan colored and short lived. The aroma is dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is mild roast coffee and dark cocoa that ends with a mildly bitter note. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and almost entirely dry in the finish. The hop presence is there in taste and feel, but it's impossible for me to single out specific flavors over the malt bill. Overall, very good, very balanced example of the style.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Clear brown color with a decent head and nice lacing. Fragrant nutty aroma and dark toast.

THe mouthfeel is somewhat full with a light mildly carbonated finish. Overall this is really classy beer - unbalanced for the style, but iconically America in sensibility.","  rDev It pours dark red when seen under an intense light. Thick head.

Pours a mahogany brown, though getting past the darkness you can tell it's likely a clear beer (like many of DFH beers). The head builds up a light brown, and remains in a thick rim around the glass throughout the pour, with continents of thin film across the surface.  Nose has a little more roasted nut and even a little darker malt in it. I actually think I get the brown sugar, and a little bitter hops also comes through.  Taste starts off with a little sweetness to a dark bready malt flavor. The bitterness catches up fairly quickly, though, to bring the flavor back into balance. One of the classic brown ale flavors, a light nuttiness comes in to lean this a little more brown than a darker porter, in my opinion. The woodsy hops actually play nicely here, but do seem to add an American hoppiness to this beer (taste and power).  The beer is a little thin rolling over my tongue, but with the bold flavors, this actually helps keep it fairly easy to drink in more than sips.  I expected to rate this beer decently having had it many years ago and enjoying it. But this beer is even better than I recall. The balance of the brown with a little extra hop notes that don't overtake the beer hits the spot.","  rDev Hey look, a brown ale I'm a fan of. This one is a deep brown, and is replete with minimal light tan head in the 1/3  range. Aroma is interesting, English brown malt, some hopping, a fractional amount of smoke/roast/charred matter.  Taste hits more of the brown and scotch ale notes than it does ipa. Even though 50ibu it seems less than that with everything else going on malt wise.   A pretty cool beer even though I probably go years at a time between having one. Its one of the more respectable offerings from DFH.","  rDev Dark brown in color with minimal light penetration. A fingernail of beige is present with light lacing. I smell brown sugar, molasses, and dark malt. I taste brown sugar and piney hops at the back of the palate. The mouth is slightly syrupy and chewy.","  rDev I had this beer at the brew pub 9 years ago, and I know I've had it a few times since, but this time it is following a Founders Porter on an empty stomach, and not working.   This brew looks great. All dark and foaming. There is little aroma.  That taste is out there. It mixes up so much and it's too early. I have to imagine that I ate a bunch of food (I'm sitting at the bar of a great restaurant, just not hungry). That helps tolerate the amalgam of hops and yeasty and nastiness.   I do remember now that this brew had this big nasty taste. Stay away, Bob, stay away.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass A: Brown with a hint of red and a generous head S: Malty, a bit nutty, light hop notes T: Nicely balanced with roasted malts, fresh hops and a light not cloying caramel flavor M: Medium-bodied focused on malt richness but with light carbonation and a bit of a hop bite O: I'm not usually a brown ale fan but this one is balanced with noticeable hops in addition to the malts making it quite enjoyable","  rDev Light and brown like a brown ale for sure. I can't smell the ipa part in there but definitely hoppy with herbal and earthy character mostly in the smell. You can believe yourself being in the woods if you close your eyes and smells this beer plus a great roastyness. The taste is lighter and more on the caramel. The carbonation is average. This is a great beer but the smell let you want more complexity for the taste but it might be explained by the fact that I enjoyed a great dipa just before that","  rDev Cask pour at the brewery. Creamy texture, smooth slick, roast chocolate with an underlying bitter bite.

Apricot, floral, and marmalade in an appealing perfume. Yeasty, spicy notes as the beer warms, some orange/citrus and a grassy hop late in the flavor. Light body, high carbonation.

The head settles unevenly, leaving thick spongy lace,   Having this just after a Duvel chalice, this becomes easier to translate as a more amped up version. It's got a little more spice, toast, heat, and booze. Each characteristic. Yet in a way, it's still balanced, as there's nothing too clovey, and there's none of that damned banana. It's more toasted wheat and zucchini bread.  The medium body has a firm froth and finishes warmingly and satisfyingly semi-dry, exhaling pear peel.","  rDev Review 1530  I was surprised that I have not reviewed this beer before. I have consumed this beer several times in the past. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a chalice. The pour of the beer created a fluffy and airy bright white head. The retention of the head is okay, I was expecting more. Some lacing was created as it dissipated fairly quickly. The color is SRM 4, pale straw with light golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with lots of carbonation bubbles. Never evaluating this beer, I thought the head and appearance were much better. Overall it is just average for this style.   The Belgium yeast is bright and aromatic, followed by spicy floral hops and subtle herbal notes. Nosing further in the glass, I detect lightly toasted crackers, malty sweetness, phenols, and a touch of a fruity character.   The flavors start with the heavy malty sweetness, then bready and crackers. Next, the floral esters, and herbal notes, followed by phenols. A fruity note rounds out the flavors with a touch of earthiness.   The mouthfeel of the beer is coating and heavy.   The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and medium finish.   The last couple of times I drank this beer I thought the spicy hop profile was prevalent. This beer today is heavy and bready and a bit of sticky sweetness. I do not care for this beer like this, I want more hops presences. The can date codes are smudged so I do not know how old it is.","  rDev Undated can into pint glass. Pours a crystal clear gold, with a thin white head. Initial impression is spicy, fruity, somewhat sweet, with a touch of peach. Mouthfeel is exeptionally clean; alcohol is detectable but not a primary feature. Finish is clean and dry. Asdmittedly, I'm not a fan of Belgians but this one is pretty good.","  rDev 330 ml painted lightproof bottle, ABV 9.0%. Large head, surprisingly pale golden colour, slightly cloudy when yeast is poured. Excellent aroma, red fruits, barnyard and yeast, some oak. Flavour is reasonably malty, quite yeasty. Alcoholic warmth, relatively light bodied despite its strength. Aftertaste is a bit too sweet IMO. Overall quality does not quite live up to the beer's gimmicky name and bottle.","  rDev 750ml bottle. Stamped on label is 'L27 19170'. Slightly cloudy, pale gold colored body. Big multi finger white head upon each pour. Some banded lacing on off drinking side. Aroma of green apple and spice (cloves) and yeast. Taste is strong with alcohol. Flavors of banana and spices (cloves). Fruit of apple and grape. Bready malt. Belgian yeast. Sweet with a touch of dry yeast. After taste is dry. Fills the mouth for feel. Big effervescence. Excellent carbonation. Very enjoyable beer drinking experience, because of how the Belgian yeast esters bring forth layered smells and flavors, how the mouth is filled with the excited beer, and how the higher ABV% sneaks up but without mouth burn. Expresses as a beer that has been brewed expertly with a long history. The ceramic bottle is a distinctive touch. Best to drink when the beer is cooler in temperature.","  rDev From a 16oz can:  Appearance: Clear gold, big head.  Smell: Yeasty, bready, some sweetness.  Taste: Mild sweetness to start, fruity--apple and slight grape. Medium body, but light feel for its ABV.  Overall: Another classic that I'm finally getting around to trying. Unfortunately it doesn't quite hit the mark for me. I don't get much  Belgian  character to it, it just tastes like a lighter bodied malt liquor to me, especially with the apple and grape flavors. Some sort of spiciness from the yeast would give it more character to my taste buds.","  rDev A 25 ounce bottle poured into a clear glass liter mug provides a semi-clear amber liquid. There is some, but negligible head and glass lacing. A good dry hoppy and yeasty bouquet emerges from the wide opening. The taste is consistent with the aroma. It's a nice balance, just enough yeast, just enough malt and a dry hop finish which exits cleanly. The only detectable taste of alcohol augments the overall enjoyment of the beer. This is one all should try, even if it's not a preferred style.","  rDev for a belgian strong ale, this smells divine! damn great consistent brew every time i have it. which surprisingly i am only now entering it?? oh well","  rDev L: golden color, big, white, fluffy head, tons of lacing S: Belgian yeast, honey, pear and apple T: Fruits and Belgian yeast  F: Creamy, good mouth coating, dry finish  O: just a really fine, Belgian ale","  rDev This beer poured into a goblet from an undated 16.9 ounce can, had a thick head that dissipated quickly.

Lots and lots of persistent lacing all over the glass.   Smell: Yeasty with a bit of banana and clove, combined with other fruity esters.   Taste: Very nicely balanced between fruity esters, banana/clove, bready malt, and a mild noble hop bitter finish.   Mouthfeel: Smooth with a just right thickness. Light carbonation, a tiny bit sticky on the teeth.   Overall / Drinkability: A well balanced strong Belgian pale ale. Dangerously drinkable - there is no warning that this beer is 8.5% ABV when you drink it - it politely sneaks up on you by the end of the glass.

Aroma is pale malt, wheat, Belgian yeast, fruit, citrus, and coriander. Taste is wheat and bready malt, lemon, orange, hints of strawberry and faint acetaldehyde/green apple. It is peppery from mid-sip through the finish. Hops are detectable as a light bitterness developing in the finish but rapidly fades in the aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden in the mouth and nose as booze but it and the ending bitterness become more evident as the brew warms.","  rDev Pours a cloudy gold orange . Around a medium body with above average carbonation with a slight prickly feel. A pleasant appropriate feel for this style The aroma is yeast and spice forward followed by a fruity banana smell. There's a bit of malt and a little floral aroma as well . The taste is not sweet like others in this style that I've had, actually it comes off a bit dry.

Love the pink elephants....  A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. A bright golden hue with intense carbonation and fine suspended sediment. Yields a large head of frothy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding to a patchy surface layer.  S: Aroma of fruity Belgian yeast with hints of esters, banana, clove, spice, phenolics, earthiness, subtle malt and a lingering sweetness. Superb.  T: Tastes of fruity yeast esters with notes of banana, clove, spice, bubblegum, phenolics, earthiness, delicate malt and faint leafiness. The booze is well hidden. Very dry, followed by a delicate bitterness upon swallowing.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with lively carbonation and excellent body. Neither too thick nor too thin. Somewhat astringent; dries the palate. Aftertaste of fruity yeast esters, banana, clove, earthiness, light malt and sweet overtones.  O: Fantastic - a superb creation that showcases the best of Belgian brewing skill. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are an amazing mix of fruity yeast notes, earthiness and subtle malt. Lovely body. Goes down a treat - add this beer to your must-try list.","  rDev A little disappointing considering all the hype. Nice golden color with some mild head and a little lingering lacing. Smells faintly of grain, tastes of grain, yeast, mild fruitiness and a little caramel and malt. A somewhat strange tangy tart aftertaste, along with a little sourness at the end. Mild mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Alcohol taste is well hidden. I will have to try others in this style to compare, but not my favorite type of beer.","  rDev It pours amber with a very slight haze and a huge head. The aroma is suggestive of a rather sweet beer and it's dominated by yeast esters. The flavor however is surprisingly dry, with very little in the way of sweetness and in fact there is a slight tartness paired some spiciness that resembles coriander flavors. Full bodied and with mild carbonation.","  rDev I loved every beer I've had from Brouwerij Huyghe so far. This one is very good as well, as well as easy drinking. The bottle label features pink elephants and dancing octopus and crocodiles. It is appropriate that they acll themselves a family brewery.

Feel: light with some carbonation","  rDev Pours a hazy, cloudy yellow-orange with a thick foamy cloud of white sitting atop. Fantastic head retention with good lacing left behind. Aroma is yeast spice, banana, clove, and mandarin orange. Flavor profile is more robust, with a sweet edge. Notes of banana, clove, orange, and dark fruits mingle with Belgian yeast spice to formulate a supple, but tasty flavor profile. Mouth feel has a little fizz to it, but is otherwise smooth, with a fine grainy texture.

Looks outstanding in the glass. Clear pale amber body with a massive cream colored head. This slowly dissipates to a collar and solid covering, leaving layers of lacing.  Not much of an aroma here, not that I have much of a nose. A little musty fruit.  On tasting, a strong sweet malty wave washes through the mouth.

The dissipation left chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 8, amber yellow with orange hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with a few yeast floaties. A stellar presentation for the beer.  I first detect pine, grapefruit, floral esters, and resin. Next, I smell biscuits, lemons, a touch of passion fruit, wet grass, phenols, caramel, and a hint of dankness.   The flavors in the beer are floral esters, resin, pine needles, lemons, pineapple, fruity esters, phenols, oranges, caramel, a wee bit of toffee, malty sweetness, grapefruit, herbal, and a hint of pharmaceutical.  The mouthfeel of the beer is warming, astringent, and tannic.   The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish.   This is a perfect example of Imperial IPA. The hop profile is extraordinary. The malt backbone is firm but not overbearing. It reminds me of Ruination, but better.

Of course, I haven't had Dreadnaught until now because I shy from IPAs and particularly Imperials.  Dreadnaught Looks luxurious. Smells take me back to eating an orange in a pine forest in Olympic National Park. Tastes are close to balanced; until the finish that is too bitter for this malt-head's buds. In the mouth, malty and luxurious... until the bitter imbeds. Yet, even refreshing to me.  I've had only 15 from 3 Floyds, which is is not many from a master brewer started in the 1990s who is just across the border. But my admission of being a malt-head helps explain why only two of those brews I rate above the average. So there must be something else. Perhaps it's the slug:  It's not normal.  I like to think I'm normal (even tho I deep-down doubt I am.) But there is always something unknown about 3 Floyds, like some unspoken family oddness. While we all got that, I suspect 3 Floyds is telling the truth and truly is not normal. What does this have to do with beer? I dunno. I'm just trying to explore what is in my head and what my bittered buds tell me.","  rDev Copper amber color with a 4F head in a Spielgelau IPA glass. Piney aroma.

Despite my tastes shifting quite a bit since those early days, I still like this one quite a bit. It's got a nice sweetness, citrusy and grapefruity, with a massive bitterness, resinous, pithy, but clean and refreshing. There's definitely some malt character here, but it doesn't detract from everything else.  This is medium bodied, very drinkable, with a clean and refreshing but intense bitterness.

There's a bit of staying power to the topping, including a little lacing as I drink it down. As a still cold brew, it presents as a classic malt-supported bitter IPA. There is a bit of sweetness to it (mostly up front) that speaks to it being a pretty strong double IPA; a little bite in back reinforces this.  The nose is some melon that may come from a combination of lighter honey malt notes and some form of tropical fruit. Grapefruit complete with rind is the main bitter note, but there's a hint of something a little earthy in there as well.  As it warms, the bitterness seems to sneak forward. On my first of this beer (side-by-side with other 3F beers), there was more of a dichotomy between the sweeter-seeming front malt, tropical notes and nicely bitter back end notes. On this can, that transition is a little smoother. Pith and pine with a thread of grain rolling throughout.  I'm enjoying this even a tad more than the first can, which I liked pretty well on its own. I nice DIPA that doesn't quite seem as strong as it is and works for me in the classic IPA sense.","  rDev [IMG] Poured into a 16 oz Nordic pint glass canned on 2/15/2021. Pours a fairly clear orange amber with a finger plus sticky off white head that leaves massive streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.25  Aroma orange, caramel, biscuit, pine, apricot, and grapefruit rind. 4  Taste follows orange, caramel, biscuit, apricot, pine, and grapefruit definitely a tad bitter, but plenty of malt in to support it. 4  Mouthfeel is big, plenty of life, a tad sticky and dry, and at 9.4% it goes down plenty easy. 4  Overall this is a nice change of pace and I will have no problem working through this 4 pack, but I just not my thing anymore. The malt stands up as much as the hops of not more. 4","  rDev Pours a light copper color with two big fingers of fluffy head. The nose is biscuity and malty with a trace of citrus. The malt backbone is potent and is paired with a bitter finish that definitely means business. The body is hearty.","  rDev 16oz bottle dated 04/10/20 poured into a pint glass shows a darker golden, clear, yellow body and floats a proud 2 finger head of white foam leaving a fully weblaced glass.  Aromas of pine and orange flow into the flavors of bitter pine resin, citrus zest, and a solid cracker and malt back.  Mouthfeel is softer, leaning full, and leaving a slight citrus rind stickiness.  Overall a nice reminder of the American IPA style.","  rDev 12oz bottled 04/09/20 (24 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on label. The beer pours bright golden amber in color with sticky khaki colored head. The head recedes to a fat splotchy ring and leaves some lacing. The aroma is sweet and medium low in intensity with candied orange, pine and caramel. The taste is semisweet caramel with bitter pine and citrus right behind trailing off to a medium plus bitter citrus rind finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Residual sticky hop oil and some malt sweetness combine to keep the finish from being dry, yet it's not heavy or overly sweet. No trace of the 9.5% ABV. Overall, excellent to my taste. An example of the exact type of beer I began to seek out fifteen years ago and still seek out today.","  rDev One of the old classic DIPAs that I look forward to whenever it slots back into FFF's rotation. Nice copper-orange with good clarity and a full finger of head. Orange zest, grass and pine resin on the nose, with intense citrus and bitterness on the palate. Plenty of malt to balance the finish.","  rDev Had poured from 22-oz. bomber, no date, into Teku.  Orange-gold beer, with a decent head/lace show; mango, sharp citrus, (as warms) big malt and classic 3F yeast aroma, Dreadnaught delivers a big fruity butt-kicking imperial IPA, where the malt backbone is more understood than evident.","  rDev My first experience with this classic and it has easily passed the test of time. Lemon citrus, earthy, dank, slight onion, bread, and a touch of bitterness. 9.5% ABV is super well hidden. Old school, full mouthfeel. This is an IPA.","  rDev Bottled 2/1/16; drank 2/13/16 @ the Yarchives.   Semi-opaque bright orange appearance.   A rough pour yielded a nice bright white head; a curtain of sharp tree-rung lace.   Mango, pineapple, honey &amp; fresh ganja notes in the nose.   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Mango &amp; pineapple flavors up front; honey &amp; dry grapefruit notes on the finish. No booze heat.   Juicy &amp; sweet with a nice dry bite for ballast. Excellent!","  rDev 22oz bomber served in a Duvel tulip glass. No date that I could find on the bottle.   Appearance: Mostly clear copper-amber color. Persistent thin off-white foam. Lots of strands and sheets of persistent lacing.   Smell: Grapefruit, pine, peach, mango, orange.   Taste: Grapefruit, peach, mango, orange rind, a solid caramel malt middle, and a bitter finish with more grapefruit and pine.   Mouthfeel: Nicely thick, good carbonation, a definite stickiness on the teeth due to all the hops.   Overall / Drinkability: Intense, but all the hops are nicely balanced by the right amount of malt sweetness. Dangerously drinkable with well-hidden alcohol. Went well with mac and cheese and I'll definitely have to pick this one up again to pair with some other meals.","  rDev Picked up a bomber at Binny's in downtown Chicago on 5-11-18 for $11.99. Bottled on 4-13-18. Stored in the beer fridge upon our return to PHX.  Beer poured golden orange with a very nice white head that has some great hang time.  Nose is fresh citrus forward, very nice.  Taste is grapefruit and orange forward over a large malt body. Finish has a nice medium touch of rind to let you know this is an IPA.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, very refreshing yet very smooth.  Overall a very good double IPA! Back before the craft beer explosion this was one of those holy grail beers and i am happy to finally try it many years later!","  rDev Pours a very nice light amber color with a generous head and lacing Aroma has abundant hoppy and malt hints The taste follows the nose with a resonating hoppy and malt flavor A medium bodied well carbonated beer A very well balanced Imperial IPA","  rDev From tasting notes 10/14/17 Had on-tap at 3 Floyds Brewing in Munster, IN  Appearance - Served in a 10oz nonic glass, slight haze and golden orange in  color with a white, solid layer of suds across the surface that thickens around the edges. Lacing coats the glass in massive amounts of broken sheeting.  Smell - Strong citrusy aroma that hits on both grapefruit and orange notes. Faint breadiness. 4  Taste - Follows the nose. Orange upfront with a light grapefruit bitterness. Hints of toasted bread and, once it warms, emerging caramel. Light, lingering grapefruit pith notes.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Slick, easy drinker with a slightly watery finish.  Overall - An easy drinking DIPA that sacrifices full flavor in favor of drinkability. I much prefer a more complete flavor experience, but to each their own.","  rDev Copper colored with an inch of frothy and creamy beige on top. The aroma is a blend of gentle, piney hops and light crackery malt. I'm tasting plenty of orange rind and tangerine with intense bitterness. There's some light crackery malt to keep things from getting out of hand. The mouth is resinous and dry.","  rDev Poured from 22oz (650ml) bottle into glass. Bottle on date is '4-11-17'. Somewhat cloudy, orange/amber body, persistent white cap and considerable lacing. At its age, aroma is somewhat muddled, with citrus and peach noted. Taste of mango, peach, and citrus, with caramel. Still very tasty. Good amount of bitterness but tempered by sweetness. Fuller, mouth coating, slight syrup in the mouth feel.  Outstanding Imperial IPA. Will purchase this any chance I get. Hides ABV very well.","  rDev From @FFFjunkie's BIF box. Poured from 22 oz. bottle into 3 Floyd's pint glass. It pours a cloudy, medium amber color with orange hues, and an enormous, foamy, ecru-colored head and tons of lacing that persisted through the pour. It's really attractive. The nose is malt-forward with subdued tangerine, pineapple, resinous pine, and floral hops. This is delicious! The first thing I taste is fairly sweet malt followed by tart grapefruit and lemon. There follows sweeter fruit: tangerine and pineapple. As if that's not enough the finish is a battle between creamy caramel and fairly biting hops. The overall taste is complex and pleasing; the flavors all blend really nicely. The mouth feel is pleasantly creamy with moderate carbonation and with its 9.5% ABV and 100 IBU, it's not for the faint of hearted. Overall, this DIPA has it all: it's attractive bold, complex flavors, and a pleasing mouth feel. I'm enjoying it immensely!"]},{"Name":"Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR)","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/447/1331/","Brewery":"Pabst Brewing Company","Style":"Lager - Adjunct","Alcohol":4.74,"Score":68.0,"Comments":["  rDev Classic AAL.

Sweetish candy aroma, some grassy notes. Fizzy mouthfeel. The flavour? What flavour? Tastes mainly like carbonated water, just a hint of sweetness reveals that it is not. Papery and  empty  finish. Gets one point for not having any offensive  side flavours .","  rDev Drinking this at home. Poured from a can into a pint glass. Appears golden yellow with a rocky foamy head that dropped quickly.

Taste is more grain, a little honey, something vaguely herbal, surprised that it's not very sweet. Skunky flavor comes across a little, but it just seems more like a reminder that it's an AAL than a problem.  Mouthfeel is very light, dry, crisp, though there's a slight filminess to it. Overall, this is definitely a worthy AAL. It's not an IPA or anything like that...it is what it is, and if you don't like AALs you won't like this.","  rDev A clear pint glass drawn off a tap reveals a very light and practically translucent amber liquid. A faint pastry sweet smell comes with it. There's not much head and just a little glass lacing to see. Vaguely sweet and mostly devoid of any significant character, malt and hops can just barely be detected. Who's the one handing out ribbons?","  rDev If you drink this when its 100 degrees out, it'll taste as spectacular as it should. It's got nice bready biscuit malt, light floral hop bite, lighter bodied, and refreshing. Otherwise, fairly forgettable but well within reason given its typical price range.","  rDev What can I say, or even write about this...?  I had one today, my first one.

Really a top notch nose compared to the other AALs I have tried recently. T: Dry. Palate follows the nose closely. Very light bitterness, just enough for a crisp, refreshing finish without astringency. M: Light bodied with light, but steady carbonation overall. O: I hadn't had a PBR in an eternity, but being near bankruptcy and a lack of national distribution network will do that. Glad to see it's back and found it better than I remembered. I found it to be a light, very dry and very refreshing lager. I can see the resurgence in its popularity. My score reflects how it stacks up against its peers and not what it is not, i.e a  big flavor  beer. Could have been my go to AAL going forward, if I hadn't had a Coors Banquet in the meantime.","  rDev Pours a very clear golden color. 1 finger white head. Some lacing, and ok retention.  The nose has nothing. No aroma at all when poured from the tap.  Taste - sweet malts. That is the flavor. Just the slightest hint of hops.  Body is what is expected from an AAL. For an AAL, this is quite good. If you're comparing it to a high rated NEIPA, you'll be dissatisfied.","  rDev 16 oz can  Pours light clear straw gold. Sugar white head retains as a bit of lacing.  Aroma is corn sugar, light biscuit and cereal.  Tastes lightly of corn sugar and cereal malt. Very clean.   Light body, fizzy soda pop carbonation.   Weirdly I kind of like this as something like a hard soda pop. It's very sweet by a beer standard, very lightly flavored and very clean. Crisp and drinks very easy. It's barely a beer but it's shockingly inoffensive. I could drink a ton of this. I see the appeal and why this has a bit of a cult following.

The first beer I ever had was one of my Dad's PBRs from the basement fridge. I drank this beer EXCLUSIVELY for 42 years (until about when it started its resurgence, at which point I figured I'd done my part to preserve an American icon, and moved on to craft beers). So much for  living on a beer budget . I thought it was appropriate to make PBR my 1000th beer on BA. There was an appealing symmetry there, plus I feel that #1000 occupies a position of some significance. PBR deserves it.  Pabst is actually a decent beer. You can drink a lot of it without getting totally trashed, and it's pretty cheap so you'e not breaking the bank either. It was best in returnable bottles (remember them??) but it's OK in cans too. I occasionally run into PBR on tap, which is irresistible (it's not that much better, but hey - it's PBR on TAP!!) OK, so it tastes a little grainy and maybe it's over-carbonated. But it's a damn sight better than Bud, Miller, or any other macro swill. Hint: drink this stuff COLD. Optimal temperature is when it CRYSTALLIZES when you pop the can or bottle cap.

I had to get this beer shipped to me, living in a beer desert it hard to get good beer. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A beautiful two-fingered bright white foamy and creamy head was formed. The retention of the head is excellent. Lacing was created on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with loads of carbonation bubbles.   I first get spicy hops, a touch of floral, malty sweetness, wet grass, and orange peel. Nosing further, I detect coriander, wheat, and phenolic.  The flavors in the beer are orange peels, floral esters, ginger, coriander, phenolic, lightly toasted malts, and malty sweetness akin to honey. The flavors kind of remind me of Belgium pale ale with a splash of Heff. It does have a light funk factor nothing I really could detect.   The mouthfeel is crisp, effervescent, and creamy.   The body of the beer is medium, high carbonation, and a medium finish.   This beer is stellar. The flavor complements each other well and the malt profile is there but not overbearing.

Somehow I haven't reviewed it , &amp; have to admit, slightly intimidated to do it now. How to do it justice? Will the  objective #s measure up to my overall impression of it? Hmmmm??? OK, here goes :   Translucent gold-ish orange, with a huge forever head , that leaves a thick ring , substantial surface covering, and sheets of lacing . (Or it would, if I could hold off on drinking for a few more minutes - trust me - that's what happens. ;) )   Smell ? Nectar-Of -The-Gods, if you like that sort of thing. ;) . The usual banana, clove,  spicy  [ coriander+black pepper+ je ne sais quoi yeast aroma ], with a touch of  fresh  [wheat-derived, mostly] aroma, that usually accompanies saisons, goses, &amp; Berliners. Just better than the usual.   Taste is similar to aroma, sort of, with elements of [very] ripe banana, black pepper, clove, coriander, 2-day-old homemade bread crust, a vague, very faint citrus element, a kiss of sweetness, and that ~indescribable (by me) , signature Ommegang yeast flavor . Some mild, mildy-drying bitterness.  Feel is light-medium, but give the impression of substantial presence, while also floating-on-air, just above eye level. Moderate, moderately-soft , carbonation tingle that extennnnnnnnnndddddddssss for quite awhile , before disappearing, &amp; leaving the front pof the tongue a bit dry, &amp; slightly stripped.   Overall, as you might guess, I am astounded &amp; enthralled all over again. If anything, this might be a bit TOOOOO fresh , &amp; could use 3-4 more months on it.

Pours a beautiful looking slightly hazy yellow-orange color with a good amount of fluffy white head that slowly settled, and small soapy sheets of lingering lacing. Smells of fresh muddled tropical hops, yeast, wheat, banana, clove, vanilla, bread, some faint floral hops. No real musty or funky aromas. Taste follows the nose, great balance and drinkability. Some very pleasant wheat flavors, not my usual style of beer but this was just so easy to drink. Smooth, mild mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation.

Can bottom stamped Best By 07/13/19”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Appearance – 3.5. First pour – Light yellow, clear. Body – Light yellow, opaque. When held to direct light, light yellow with many tiny particles forming a haze. Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), white, medium density, average retention, slowly diminishing to a three to four mm crown and rocky partial cap. Lacing – None. At 7.7% it should have been able to cough up a bit of lacing. Aroma – 4 – Spice and yeast. Flavor – 4 - Spice predominates. Slightly bitter, but that could be more a function of the spices than hops. No hop flavor or aroma. No malt flavors. No alcohol (7.7% ABV as marked on the label) taste or aroma. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 3.25 – Medium, watery, medium carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4. This is a well-made example of the style, in terms of appearance (despite no lacing) and spicy aroma. The flavor is a bit overboard on spice with too few yeast characteristics. Despite being well past the outdate, this compares well with the bottle I had back in November of 2009. I didn’t care for it then and I still don’t, although I like the style.","  rDev From notes 2/11/12: Pours a beautiful opaque straw forming a large, white, thick, billowy head of foam that leaves behind minimal lacing. Aroma is a little wheat-like and yeasty, somewhat cider-like as well; some banana citrus and spice mixed in. Taste is lighter than expected with some bitterness and lightly sour sweetness (does that make sense?), pale malt, fruity esters of banana and lemon. Finishes dry with the only hop presence detectable in the sip.","  rDev What does it say about me that I haven't had, let alone rated, this highly-regarded brew? For shame.  Poured from a single bottle into a tulip.  The brew is hazy, but not cloudy, peach/gold, with excellent foamy head that quickly dissolves, but leaves a persistent ring of lace all of the way down the quaff.   The aromas are subtle but complex. Faint esters, clove, coriander, white pepper, citrus, white grape, yeast and funk.  The brew is spicy sweet on the tip of the tongue, with pale malts, esters, honey, pear, and citrus. The mid-palate carries this through with spicy yeast, white pepper, and coriander, with a bit of green apple, and white grape tartness. The hops are welcome but pleasingly understated, showing up as grassy, and earthy notes, not bitter ones. Perhaps the faintest hint of warming booze, but so mild that it melds into the peppery yeast. It skews perhaps a bit sweet for the style.   The brew is solidly medium, but remarkably carbonated and dry, nonetheless. It finishes with a pleasing tingle on the tongue.   American takes on European styles often exhibit reckless measures of hops or booze. Not this bad boy. Despite the slightly ramped up ABV, and the slightly sweeter than normal flavor, this brew is otherwise restrained and remains very well-balanced and smooth. One of the most crisp and refreshing brews at this ABV I've ever had.","  rDev  Best by June 2016 ; drank 11/4/15 @ the Yarchives.   Semi-opaque pale yellow appearance.

Banana &amp; faint caramel flavors up front; dry black pepper notes on the finish.   A nice take; hardly transcendent.","  rDev Hazy golden-orange with visible effervescence, a creamy white head, good retention, and streaky lacing. Smells of ripe banana, clove, hay, dried apricot, pear, apple skin, honeydew melon, and toast. The taste follows the nose. Banana and dried apricot upfront, followed by toast and cracker, apple, pear, lemon, honeydew melon, green grape, hay and clove. A hint of sweetness throughout, but finishes dry and spicy. The feel is medium-plus-ish, highly carbonated like champagne, providing a prickling and pillowy sensation that quickly rolls across the palate and disappears into dryness. A sensational American saison! One of the OG American saisons, this stands up to the test of the time. Phenomenal stuff.","  rDev 750 mL cork and cage bottle from the LCBO; best before Nov 27 2019 and served barely chilled. Long overdue for a look.  Pours hazy medium gold; slightly clouded, highly effervescent body, generating more than two fingers of puffy, pillowy white head comprised of big, soapy bubbles. It falls apart slowly, requiring more than ten minutes to fully dissipate - a patchy cap and fat collar of foam remain, with gobs of messy lace also having been deposited in its wake. Kind of smells like a hefe to me - I'm getting a lot of ripe banana on the nose, with spicy hints of clove, pepper and coriander. Wheaty, grainy, bready pale malt backdrop sweetness, with light hints of lemon/orange peel and orchard fruit providing some added depth.  Quality stuff; ostensibly Belgian in theme, though I think if you gave this to me blindfolded, I'd believe it to be a hefeweizen - its ripe banana esters are the main reason for that notion, while its wheaty, bready malt notes merely reinforce it. Citrusy hints of orange peel and lemon zest rise to the occasion by mid-sip, leading into a spicy, yeasty tail end that includes suggestions of clove, pepper and coriander; clove spice and wheat grain sweetness wrap up the sip before a dry aftertaste. Medium in body, with assertive, prickly carbonation at first, though it does settle down quite a bit throughout the course of the glass, becoming more smooth and soft. While not a factor within the flavour itself, the alcohol does warm the throat/chest just a tad as you sip your way into this one.  Final Grade: 4.16, an A-. Ommegang's Hennepin did not disappoint, but it didn't exactly knock my socks off, either. That is to say, there's nothing out of place here: it's exactly what it needs to be, without going above or beyond in any specific manner. It's a solid beer in and of itself, but it's priced at $10.45 per bottle (in this market) and that seems kinda pricey for what I'm getting. Don't get me wrong - I liked it, and I'd consider buying it again, but I dunno how often I'll be returning to this at that price. In any event, cheers to a fine pick for my 1800th review.","  rDev Really nice aroma of citrus rind,yeast,floral,citrus fruit. Taste was very similar and it was just a bit sweet. Had an interesting spice bite that lingered in the aftertaste. Was glad that I tried it and would seek this out again","  rDev A beautiful beer, nice copper color with thick, two finger head. Part of an Ommegang gift set (with the glass), it has a nice aroma and taste, but doesn’t stick to the palate (no aftertaste). Otherwise, a nice Belgian from Ommegang. Can’t wait to try the rest....","  rDev 750mL corked bottle bb June 2017 poured into a Ommegang signature glass at fridge temp 7.7% ABV. The beer pours hazy orange yellow with a few floaties and fizzy off white head. Very little head or lacing after 2 minutes. The aroma is very musty (wet basement like) with little else coming through. The taste is rather subdued with some traces of wheat and pils malts and some familiar Belgian yeast character but muted and leaning to the musty side. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, ok but not what it would be fresh. Did not know where to look for a date on this, but I've had it fresh before and it was great. Rated to the average and will review again when opportunity presents itself.","  rDev Dark straw yellow in color with a light haze. Poured with a robust, bright white, fizzy foam that quickly settled. Medium high aroma of anise and sweet bready, wheat malt with light peppery notes hiding in the distance. Fruity aromas begin to intensify as this warms. Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Lush, creamy smooth feel up front with boozy warmth emerging from the middle to the end. Sweet bready, malty flavors up front with hints of sweet bananas. Light peppery and anise esters follow on the edges and slowly overtake the sweetness. Tart fruitiness in the middle followed by sweet apple, pear and berries. Finished with a tart fruit flavor followed by a mellow sour dough yeastiness and light peppery notes. Flavors and aromas were complex while subtle. A tasty enjoyable beer.","  rDev Appearance - Pours light golden color with thick rocky white head that lasts forever.  Aroma - Yeast, banana, clove, light funky, straw with a touch of bubblegum.  Taste - Taste leans less toward the funk and more toward the yeast, banana and clove side. Just a hint of funk at the end.  Feel - Light bodied prickly carbonation touch of dryness on the finish.  Overall - A well done saison, nice flavors very easy drinking.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information. A: Pours a slightly, hazy golden color with a very robust and creamy white head showing good retention and some lacing. S: Aromas of corn/grain initially with an evolving and increasing clove and lemon scent, as it warms. T: Very dry. Clove and hot pepper flavors mostly, maybe some citrus. Strong bitterness throughout. M: Light bodied with significant carbonation despite rather high ABV for style. Crisp finish. O: A nice representative of the Saison style. A little drier and more bitter than average, but with a more complex flavor profile and more refreshing than most.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a solid amber with a modest head which reduces to a ring and a large continent. Possibly some fruit and malt in the nose. The mouth gets a bit of malt and really slight funk. Enjoyable.  2020: Found an ancient bottle in the basement: Still good!","  rDev Really nice carbonation. Nice funky saison flavors. Nice spice and peppery touch at the end. Get a touch of apples and lemons. Does a good job of not being to overly sweet.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Cloudy yellow color with a rich and foamy head and great lacing. Fragrant and fruity smell, very pleasant. The taste is classic saison, fruity, lemons and spice. Very nice beer!","  rDev Substantial yellow haze, 3/4  white head. Aroma rocked that spice cabinet chalk full of clove and whatnot.  Taste was more wheat than almost any beer I've had which is saying a lot. Alcohol was kinda pronounced. Some citrus in there. Really tastes more like a hefe than a saison. Lacks the dry finish, the levity. This comes off as an imperial hefeweizen. The clove dominates. Format is expensive.   Break out the  overrated  chant.","  rDev I bought a bottle of the Hennepin from my local Meijer and was quite pleased. It poured a slightly hazy yellow with white head that did not leave much lace. I was careful with the pour to ensure that I did not get much sediment in the glass. The scent was floral with waifs of fruit. The taste was nicely balanced with potpourri and lemon like fruit. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this was a solid saison.","  rDev poured into Tulip from bottle, 2.5 fingers white soapy head recedes to a pool around the outside of the glass. Light golden in the glass, was careful with the pour, but there is a good bit of yeast in suspension, but that doesn't bother me. Smells of biscuit, lemon, faintly of ginger.. Taste is initially sweet malt in the beginning, followed up by coriander, faint orange and a hint of ginger heat/or saison spiciness. Beer has a somewhat sharp, spicy dry finish. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation makes it almost champagne like. Great beer, keeping these on hand for when we go out for sushi.","  rDev Known as the king of Farmhouse ales, I had to try this.   Hennepin comes barreling out of the bottle before I got a chance to pour it, with toothpaste-like thick foam, bubbling over and creating a beautiful disaster. When poured, the liquid takes a second or two to get past the foam and then develpps into a perfectly hazy, light mango flesh colored body. The head continues to look like shaving cream mixed with white toothpaste, just absolutely pasty and unrelenting. 100% opacity.   Fresh fruits on the nose with green and white grape, oranges, stone fruits/drupe, cantaloupe, accented with cinnamon and pie spices.   A wheaty-hay character starts it out, followed by a wash of circus peanut, banana split, and yeast. A stale cracker/wet hay malt flavor permeates the profile though, detracting a bit from the experience overall. Some lemon-lime flavored water finishes out the profile. 4 seems too generous and 3.75 seems too low, it's a hard decision.   Feel is crisp, light, and dry like a white whine or champagne. Not bad at all and a great compliment to the style and flavor profile.   Overall, I think this is the first Saison I've had this season, though I may be mistaken. Perhaps I'm not giving it a fair chance, but I thought this was just above average. Not neccesarily bad, but not totally mind-blowing either. Will I have it again? Maybe. Great Divide's Collette and GI's Sophie still reign as king in my book for the Farmhouse Ale.","  rDev This ale is a master stroke of taste and marketing. Overall, the only  5  rating I have ever given a brew.  First I want to talk about the marketing. (Besides, Hennepin's 2177 reviews have said everything about its taste imaginable.) So, here is my take based on a few facts and what I hope is informed speculation. Duvel's success made clear the huge potential market for Belgian ales. Duvel also learned how hard it is to distribute in 50 states. Duvel's owner (Moortgat) was among Ommegang's original and, eventually, controlling investor. Seemingly, Ommegang's strategy was to lead in America's craft market for Belgians by tagging along with Duvel's distribution network here and helping build it. Both grew.   We also can look at this bookends in history. Hennepin, a Belgian missionary, discovered Niagara Falls. I view Hennepin, the beer, as Moortgat's missionary to help bring Belgians to America and to focus on making ales for fine cuisine.  It also helped that Hennepin tastes great. If you want to review BA's Bros and Top Raters as I did, I find little more I can say except to relay some other experts. However, I will note that the label pictured as the current one is not superior to the original. But, there is no need to judge this gem by its cover.  While MJ's 1999  Guide  gave Hennepin 3 of 4 stars and called it  fruity, dry counterpart to a Belgian saison , MJ gets wildly enthusiastic on page 416 of his  Great Beers of Belgium  and even compares it to the classic Saison Dupont.  Oliver Garrett's calls Hennepin  Ommegang's finest creation  (page 197  Brewmaster's Table ) and talks about how its sweet and sour center makes it an excellent accompaniment to food.   These two generations of beer's master writers agree. So 2177 reviewers and one of BA's highest rated saisons must all be correct !  Collectively, Hennepin is a master stroke on a mission.  7/18/20 Bringing a magnum to an outdoor party of wine-drinkers. I hope to get at least one convert. Hennepin is my go-to for appetizers and summer fare. I wish it were easier to find. But, I am satisfied with my review (2,160 characters!) and will keep count over at UnTappd.","  rDev Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a one and a half inch white head and decent lacing. Smells yeasty, floral, bananas, orange and spices. Tastes of yeasty bread, bananas, lemongrass, cloves and orange peel. Finishes with a bit of hops. Well carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel, crisp and refreshing."]},{"Name":"Blind Pig","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/22790/","Brewery":"Russian River Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":6.25,"Score":97.0,"Comments":["  rDev The Pig, bottled 122321, pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a thick dense head and BIG bubbles of carbonation.

My Extreme Thanks to @RaulMondesi for sharing.","  rDev 17.25 oz bottle into my new Kevin Malone rastal.  Bottled on 8/11/21.  Thanks to Donald for this surprise box!  Mostly clear gold but with a little chill haze, and a classic west coast head; bone white at 2 fingers, leaving gorgeous lace destroying the glass as it recedes gradually.   Aroma brings forward slight papery oxidation, with slight onion skin, dusty pine flooring, grapefruit rind, and dead hop leaves. I do not detect any yeast, malt, or ethanol in this beer. It is cutting and dirty and bitter smelling. It's a change from what I'm used to, but also brings me back to when IPAs were all emulating the giants like RR.   Flavor doesn't hit until about mid-palate. When that happens it brings sawdust first, then a little evergreen, then some onion skin, a tiny presence of crisp caramel malt, and then some papery oxidation. After you swallow it however, the flavor really shines. It sticks to your tongue and cheeks and roof, and sucks all moisture out. Then, seemingly suddenly, a wave of resiny bitterness and sweet honey take over and the oils take hold, pounding your palate with lupulin gland again and again. The finish is literally 10x as long as the beer itself, and takes time to dry on your palate. Then a whole new world opens up.  Feel is resiny, oily, very carbonated, with no alcohol anywhere in sight. Palate punisher, this one, as the oils destroy and scrub every taste bud from your mouth.   Overall, an impressive one to be sure, and it's easy to write paragraphs about it. This is one that should be in the books (and probably is), right along side its cousin Pliny, and has every right to be studied and emulated. This is a true west coast IPA in every sense of the word.   Exemplary.","  rDev Clear gold, with a sticky eggshell white head. Very good retention, tons of lacing.  Aroma of yellow grapefruit, honey, white bread, juice pineapple, and white pepper.  Huge flavors of pineapple, lemon zest, yellow grapefruit, grass, honey, crackers, and white pepper. Tart and juicy pineapple/lemon/grapefruit upfront, cracker/honey in the middle, and then grass/pepper on the finish. Crisp and clean, very dry for an IPA, with a slight lingering bitterness of grapefruit/lemon peel, white pepper, and faint pine.  Medium-light feel, well carbonated, snappy and dry.  A fantastic dry WCIPA. Highly recommended.","  rDev L- Pours a very slighty hazy Lemon-Orange with a fluffy, on-finger, soapy head. S- A wonderful smell of citrus hop and candied fruit. T- Wonderful blend of peppery, citrus hop with a piney finish. very good bitterness in which the resin sticks around. M- Medium body with a Piney, dry finish. O- One of the best bitter APA's around.","  rDev Review #1437  This beer was elusive every time I knew it was available beer sold out before I could get there. I have tried for years to get this beer. I was browsing this store has an extensive beer section, and found this with other goodies. The beer is 44 degrees and poured into a pint glass. Beer produced a frothy, airy, and foamy two-fingered head. The retention of the beer is excellent. As the beer dissipated, it left lacing on the glass. The color of this IPA charts around SRM 4, pale gold with a hint of straw. The is crystal clear with carbonation dancing around.   The initial aromas in the beer are pine, grapefruit, oranges, and biscuit. Next, I smell bread, floral esters, herbal, a touch of resin, earthiness, and lemons.   The flavors in the beer are pine, grapefruit, crackers, toasted bread, biscuit, earthy, floral, bay leaves, resin, and lemons.   The body of the beer is medium-light, medium-plus carbonation, and a medium finish.  This beer is just over a month old. The first sip of the beer, I want to know, where are the big hop profile. The more I drank it, the bouquet of hops began to explode on my palate. This beer needs to be around 46 degrees to enjoy what is inside. The hop combination is impeccable and dang near perfect. A great beer to enjoy during a beautiful summer night on a porch with a breeze. Glad I did try it, I will seek this out again.","  rDev L: Lighter golden yellow, filtered, and with a two inch beige head of average retention and the tiniest speckled lacing.  S: Pine Resin with more citrus as it comes to temp. Off-dry with smoothing oak anD malt qualities.  T: Follows the nose. Not complex but well executed.  F: Light-medium weight, awesomely bitter, and right-sized carbonation.  O: A really nice west-coaster. The sum greater than the parts so this is the first time I’ve put the overall higher than the other individual ratings. It is better than 4.25 for sure.","  rDev Poured from a growler filled at the Hill Farmstead brewery.  Pours a crystal clear golden Amber color with 2 fingers of dense off-white head. The head has exceptional retention, leaving some stringy cobwebs of lacing before eventually settling into a thick blanket of foam. Gorgeous beer.   The aroma is a nice and clean, but doesn't quite jump out of the glass. There's a lot of citrus; namely grapefruit, orange zest and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Some cracker malt with a ton of earthiness and pine. Slightly floral throughout.   The flavor follows the nose: Very floral and citrusy. There's some faint notes of pineapples and biscuit malt before a finishing wave of bitter, earthy pine. Pretty well-balanced overall.  The mouthfeel is just... Muah. Medium-full bodied with pretty lively carbonation. Creamy and fluffy, yet crisp and dry. Disturbingly drinkable.  Overall, this is definitely a great IPA that I am very fortunate I got to try. While this doesn't live up to the standards of Pliny, in my opinion, it's still a beautiful looking beer with a godly mouthfeel and a nice hop bite.","  rDev Bottled on 2/20/20  Pours a pure translucent honey gold body capped with multiple fingers of thick, white head; great retention yields slowly to an ample and creamy cap, fuzzy walling of webby lacing with the occasional chunky ring, and a sizable frothy collar.  Aromas open subtly and persist evenly throughout, starting with lemon balm and hints of dry incense guiding into sweeter clementine and flaky malt undertones; wisps of woody apricot and stone fruit contribute on the back end before a citrusy orange close.  Taste offers a detailed dive into a soft grassy bittering with fleeting tropical rind tones highlighting passionfruit and pineapple; eases to a floral, grassy herbaceousness paired against a delicate tropical (mango, passionfruit, peach skin) sweetness into bright grapefruit bursting for a moment alongside clean pine into the swallow.  Mouthfeel shows a flaky-crisp medium body elevated by a brilliantly balanced fluffy carbonation; clean resin along the mid-palate gives way to a building, deft bitterness leading to flaky crispness wavering into a dry, oily finish.  A practiced exercise in the traditional west-coast IPA; malt and hops jockeying in equilibrium for a soft, fruity, and crisply bitter end. Simply put, this is astutely crafted and endlessly drinkable at every juncture.","  rDev Pours a clear golden color with a two inch fluffy head that was well retained and and left massive lacing. Smells of citrus, pine, floral notes and grass. Tastes of grapefruit, grapefruit pith, pine,resin, grass, floral elements,lemon and apricot. Medium bitterness. Light side of medium bodied, medium carbonation, clean and crisp with a dry finish.","  510ml bottle from California:  A bright, clear orange to amber with a 3cm white head that’s thick &amp; foamy but has great retention.

The taste is pine, citrus &amp; the same biscuit backing with light grapefruit &amp; a hop resin on top of a lively, well-carbonated beer that was crisp &amp; very drinkable; outstanding stuff.","  rDev Ah an old friend, you can almost smell them before they come into view. Head inflated a mile high atop that clear golden smile. A joy to see again.  This fella comes along like an orchard man, citrus flowers and fresh juice spill out in his wake. Tropical surprises, passionfruit, guava, maybe a pineapple slice in the back pocket. This is more than a carnation in the lapel. Much more But ah, the tongue is not as soft as that sweet carnation. No, while the tongue of this cheeky bastard carries the unmistakable tropical lilt, there is also a bite. The rind to that citrus fruit, bitter and sharp, reminding you where the edges are.  And don't be fooled by the cane, this is no heavy slogger. This is a light and nimble fellow. Quick of wit and light on his feet. Enjoyable to be around, if a bit abrasive at times, but a real classic gentleman.","  rDev At last I get to try this classic. Could read a newspaper through it, so clear in the golden body, with a thick white collar and white surface lacing. Smell has plenty of lemon, herbal and dank hops, and grapefruit pith, with soapy flowers accenting. Taste is very hoppy, yet not that bitter, floral and grassy, with moderate pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, and cracker malts. Fruit is especially pithy in taste. Feel is dry enough to avoid the doom label of soapy, but certainly perfumey and pithy in a good way. I'm sure 14 years ago this was groundbreaking, now it is just another good springtime ipa with expressive hop character, glad I tried it","  rDev Serving: On tap Consumed: Aug-10-2019   Pours clear orange-gold with a decent head, stringy lacing. Sports a bright citrus fruit nose, really nice grapefruit et al., light pine sap spiciness and some crackery malt.

Really nice balance of classic IPA characteristics.  4.25...4.5...4.5...4.5...4.5","  rDev Pours a lightly foggy golden-copper with a finger of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is tight notes of herbal, citrus, resiny hops and bready, biscuity malts. Flavor profile continues this track, hitting notes of herbal, resiny and citrus hops along the way. Bready and biscuity malts sweep in for a bit of balance in the center, before the sticky resiny hops add their bitter finish. Mouth feel is lightly crisp with a slight fuzziness to it. It has a medium thickness. Overall, crisp and refreshing with very light and tight hop and malt qualities. It's well controlled and yet dynamic, forming a delightful experience.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 500mL bottle.","  rDev Revisited on 8/7/20:  Not much to change, but this is just a damn near perfect WCIPA.  ____________________________________________________  Pours a dark gold color. Mostly clear and somewhat effervescent. Thinnish sudsy white head dissipates quickly leaving just a thin ring of foam along the outside of the beer.   Aroma has notes of pine, orange marmalade, tangerine, sap and some dank hop notes. The aroma here is not super pungent, but does carry strong pronounced notes.   Taste follows the nose with strong notes of pine, resin, dried grass, tangerine, tangerine rind, orange all with a strong crackery malt backbone present throughout although taking a back seat to the hops. This one punches you in the mouth a bit more with those big bold piney flavors, but the bitterness is balanced and not overly done. As the beer warms and you drink through it, there is an evident sweetness to the beer although it doesn't come across as a sweet beer per se.   Feel is medium bodied, slick, and smooth. Mildl gentle carbonation. The mouthfeel is more in line with what I'd expect from a DIPA as this one clearly punches above its ABV.   Overall a really well crafted classic IPA. I wish there were more IPAs like this still being brewed at this high of a level. A delight to drink and one that, although overshadowed by its more famous cousin, really is a true gem in its own light.","  rDev Gold color. One inch white head. Some pretty lace. Citrus and pine aroma. Very good nose. Grapefruit, orange taste. Late pine that lingers. Crisp, juicy mouthfeel.

Pours old gold with clarity and 1/2-finger near-white head, which quickly dissipates to a persistent film and leaves some sketchy lace. Big piney aroma dominated all else. Huge biting, piney hops to start, then very mild (pilsner?) malt, and a drying, bitter finish.  This straight-up piney hop assault with a minimal malt backbone helped announce and define the West Coast IPA.","  rDev One of the classics, from a less than 1 month old bottle. L - Nothing but classic transparency, good head retention, and a perfect West Coast IPA appearance. S - Just dank/pine citrus notes heaven; may be one of the better smelling IPAs at 6.2%  T - Same as the smell, just west coast pine-bitter surf notes all the way. Catch the wave... F - Great carbonation, stays lively, well made. No critique for something this weight.

It pours a crystal-clear bright gold with more than two fingers of fluffy, snow white head and thick lacing. The tiny bubbles ascending the glass testify to its effervescence. The nose features lemon and grapefruit, along with heavy pine needles and floral hops. When sipped, the first thing I notice is how dry and bitter it is. Only as the glass warmed did I taste any malt and even then it was deep in the bitter, resinous background. The citrus is dry and bitter but it opened up with some subtle sweetness as the glass warmed. The rather complex hop bill adds intense bitterness. It's hard to believe it's only 62 IBU. This ale is crisp and lite with lively carbonation, and at 6.1% ABV you can easily down a second pour. Overall, this is a quintessential West Coast IPA that is superbly crafted, delicious, and fun to drink.","  rDev Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco. Purchase to contrast with Pliny the Elder. A: Pours a slightly hazy, orange-amber color with a one quarter inch, white head, but little retention or lacing. S: Almost floral aromas of tangerine and peach evident over a caramel malt spine. T: Dry. Palate deviates from the nose, as significant peppery bitterness is the focus. Like PtE, a clean, crisp finish. M: Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. O: Solid and drinkable. Liked PtE better.","  rDev Shimmering burnt gold with a thick off-white foam that leaves drooping curtains of lace all over the glass.  This one seems a bit more dank than Pliny, but also features crackery malt. A slight hint of unwanted, airy and vegetal pine pops in before tangerine thankfully takes over in this frothy, medium bodied IPA that finishes chalk dry.  ---  Late summer 2021, we had this next to IBUsive and it was a surprisingly poignant compare and contrast. While this was actually more delicate and the Fat Head's slightly more aggressive, I'd take the Fat Head's for its clarity of expression.","  rDev This is about the most traditional/classic west coast IPA as one can find. Piney and Floral and a moderate to heavy bitter finish. A little to heavy on the pine and bitterness for me but I respect this for a very well made beer.","  rDev Pours a clear dark golden straw color with thick white head dissipating into bubbly lacing.

Purchased on 27/1/21 for $ 2.00 (Including tax) for a 16 oz can ($ 0.125/oz) from Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA. In reefer at store and stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 27/2/21. (Note: I use DD/MM/YY protocol.) Stamped on bottom of can “CANNED ON 14 MAY 2020”. Served at 48.7 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 56.4 degrees.  Appearance – 3.5. First pour – Straw (SRM 3), clear.  Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), appears clear. When rear-lite, slight haze is evident. Head – Large (Maximum 6.5 cm, aggressive center pour), white smoke, high density topped with some rocks, average retention, diminishing to a one to three mm undulating crown, and a thin partial cap. As the head retracts, some torn curtain lacing remains. Second pour produces a 2.3 cm head. Lacing – Poor. Short piece (two cm) of lacing of tiny to small bubbles with nine stalactites and columns connecting to the crown. From there on, just a few isolated tiny bubbles. Aroma – 3.5 – Begins with coriander and clove, followed by some bread - no malt, no yeast phenolics. Flavor – 3.5 – Begins spicey and slightly bitter. No hops, no malt, no yeast. No alcohol (9.5% ABV, as marked on the container) flavor or aroma, although slight gastric warming occurs. Although, toward the end of the glass, some alcohol vapor makes its presence felt. No diacetyl, no disulfide. Palate – 4 – Thin, watery, soft and dry-ish carbonation.  Final impression and summation: 3.5 Any time the palate is the best feature of a brew, look out! While this is miles above the sticky mess this used to be, its primary selling points must be its ABV and price point.","  rDev Golden amber body; lively, fine carbonation; thick and sticky white head. Notes of coriander, thyme and honey on the nose. Spicy taste right off; nice phenolic edge; peppermint and licorice; moderate bitterness; mild sweetness. Medium body; crisp and sticky on the palate; moderate sweetness to the mouthfeel with a subdued alcohol warmth and bite.  This beer melds some fine qualities of spiciness, malt sugar sweetness; and a bare touch of bitterness.","  rDev This Monkey is revealed after two 12 oz. cans were poured into a clear glass liter mug. The color is a clear and bright light amber. There's a little white head, but not much glass lacing. The aroma is pleasantly complex, with Belgian yeast sharing sensations with some hops and malts. Golden Monkey has a Belgian yeast profile, but it brings a good dose of hops and malts for the tongue. It's nicely complex and goes down smoothly for 9.5% ABV. More than just an opportunity to get a good dose of alcohol into the bloodstream, even those that are not fond of the peculiar taste of Belgian yeasts should find this accessible.","  rDev Clear gold, generous white head that gives most of itself up quickly, but the last 20% lingers, nice lace Banana, apricot, and earthy/sweet spice in the nose Green banana yeast flavor, bready malt and a hint of clove underneath Full bodied and well carbonated, but very drinkable Pretty decent for an American Tripel","  rDev Canned 8/9/19. Let warm to 50F .   Slightly hazy gold, with ample, fairly coarse, off-white head. Dissipates quickly to a 1/8  ring, and a thin surface coat of bubbles, with a few spots of lacing .  Smells of banana extract, slight clove, and a slightly piney, solvent-like aroma. Guessing that last bit is alcohol + hops. Some light doughy aroma from the open can.   Taste is light banana bread, though not as sweet, coriander, clove, a touch of sweet apple &amp; pear, goldenrod honey, a little biscuity malt and light bitterness on the finish.   Feel is medium, oily, with some very fine, light carbonation tingle.  Overall, enjoyable. Not the top of the list , but good every now and then.","  rDev 12oz can. Bottom of can is stamped 'CANNED ON 24 APR 2019'. Nearly clear, pale gold colored body. Slim finger of white head upon initial pour, which settles back to a thin cap and ring. Leaves behind some scattered lacing spots on the drinking side. Aroma of toasted malts and yeast (bubble gum and rubber eraser). Some banana and cloves. Taste is toasted malts, banana, cloves, and some fruity notes from the hops.  Medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation. This is rather hoppy for a tripel, and the hops and the phenols and esters clash in a way, instead of adding complexity. Overall good, and easy to drink. Hides the higher ABV% well. I would drink this again if looking for a spicy, higher alcohol strong ale.","  rDev Decent enough tripel. Nice carbonation, as expected, but darker than I usually like. Tends toward the spicier end of tripels rather than balancing with banana /bubble gum notes. Bready, sweet, and spiced.","  rDev A pretty good Belgian Tripel  Look: clear golden with a thick white head  Aroma: wheat, yeast, banana  Taste: The flavor is wheat, yeast, banana, some alcohol, a typical good Belgian Tripel.  Body/Overall: medium body","  rDev Pours a larger fluffy pillowy white head with good retention and great lacing, clear bright golden color with some sediment flaoting  Nose sweet candi sugar and Belgian golden malts, mild perfumey alcohol, phenol spices, some fruity esters, bubblegum and hint of banana, mild coriander-like spices, but also a bit solventy  Taste brings more of the same, sweet golden Belgian malts, grainy-sweet and a touch doughy, candi sugar and some perfumey alcohol again, plenty of esters with bubblegum, little banana, as well as phenol spices, coriander, little cereal grains and some fig and apricot notes, slight drying finish but sticky and more alcohol  Mouth is med bodied, a little sweet sticky, medium to lighter carbonation, some warming alcohol  Overall not bad, nothing special, nice esters and decent phenols, alcohol is OK, malts are a bit too light overall, and sticky feeling is a little heavy for what it is, but otherwise good","  rDev Had this on tap,overall a decent body. With around medium carbonation. Aroma is malt,banana, spice,and some yeast. Taste is a little sweet but far from too sugary and the sweetness well with the banana. Malt,spice and yeast followed which created a nicely balanced mix of flavor Overall it was a better than average beer that went well with food","  rDev From notes 5/4/15: Pours somewhat clear, orange/medium gold producing 1.5 fingers of mostly tightly bubbled, glowing white head that diminishes to a thin layer with patchy islands of surface cap but leaves only a little blotchy lacing. Aroma is bread, yeasty and acidic with esters of apple, pear and slightly phenolic. Taste is pale malt, bread, yeast esters of apple, peach and pear; there is a hint of grape, honey and mineral with a citrus hoppy bite and bitterness. It is peppery throughout. Bitterness deepens in the astringent aftertaste.","  rDev 12oz bottled 4/20/17 (18 months ago) poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 9.5% ABV. The beer pours bright golden amber in color with off white head. The head recedes to a few bubbles and a thin ring leaving a few spots of lacing. The aroma is spicy and yeasty with a hint of alcohol. The taste is semisweet clovey banana with some nice pils malt in the middle before a drying medium bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated with a slightly prickly feel on the tongue. Overall, good. This doesn't seem as cohesive as some higher rated examples, but doesn't seem as far off as the numbers would indicate.","  rDev Gold color and very clear in the glass. It has a bubbly, foamy head, high carbonation. Aroma has a strong yeastiness, like bread dough. Tasted honey and ginger, very sweet. A little citrus and bitterness at the end. Medium to full body. I think it gets better with each sip.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information evident. A: Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color with robust head formation, ultimately leaving a slight more than one inch, foamy, white head with excellent retention and solid lacing down the entire side of the glass. S: Aromas of cloves, lemon, and banana predominate the nose with a peppery note. T: Sweet to semi-sweet and smooth. Flavors of cloves, honey, maybe a bit of banana and lemon blend nicely. Bitterness light relative to overall taste palate, allowing other flavors to come through. Drinks very cleanly. M: Light to medium bodied with very consistent effervescence. O: This is likely to best American produced Tripel I have had to date. Definitely in the same league as international offerings. While impressed by the number of ratings, the overall score seems a bit low. Could there be an issue with consistency/shelf life? I refrigerated mine when I purchased it. #production information","  rDev 12oz bottle, bottled on Sept 22, 2017. Served in a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Mostly clear golden yellow with just a bit of very finely dispersed sediment if you look closely when held up to the light. Big thick white head slowly died back with persistent thick sheets and strands of lacing.   Smell: Yeasty, floral, herbal, leafy, with a bit of a whiff of noble hops.   Taste: Leafy bitterness throughout with some noble hop taste. Some fruity esters from the Belgian yeast scattered throughout. There may be some other spices in this, including Grains of Paradise, which has a distinctive taste that I'm not fond of and I think I'm detecting it here. Complex taste. The malt is somewhat muted and the sweetness for me shows up at the finish. Odd.   Mouthfeel: Prickly carbonation with some lingering spiciness on the tongue. Powdery and soft mouthfeel. Some stickiness on the teeth.   Overall / Drinkability: A very different Tripel than I've had before, but hits the style well, and is a good one to sip and savor and try to pull out all the flavors. I think the only reason I didn't enjoy it more was the Grains of Paradise - if that's what I'm tasting at the finish (it may be given the cryptic  Exotic Spice from the East  comment below). One is enough for me per evening. This much flavor might be better to pair with food rather than drinking it separately.","  rDev 12 fl. oz. bottle Served in a snifter  This beer pours a brilliant golden color. It is topped with an inch of off white head that leaves no lacing.   The smell is banana and clove right away. I also get some spiced pear.  The taste is more of the spiced pear. I get hints of banana. It has a clean finish.  Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied  I don't drink a lot of tripels. This one is well done. It tastes great and is easy to drink.","  rDev L: Clear golden orange with a small white head. Medium-plus retention, and very good lacing.  S: Banana, hay/straw, red apple, biscuit, some boozy warmth, a touch of clove.  T: Green banana complimented by lots of red apple and pear. A biscuit malt backbone with slight alcohol warmth, as well as hay/straw. Finishes dangerously dry with clove/white pepper notes.  F: Medium-bodied, ample carbonation, smooth and rounded; lightly dry. Dangerously drinkable for its abv.","  rDev I am in the midst of a VT CANQuest (tm) excursion, but having sipped upon sunshine, I decided to move away from AIPAs &amp; DIPAs for the moment &amp; delve into one of the CANs taking up space in my reefer. I flash back to the early days of The CANQuest, c. 2004/2005. I was bending Bill Covaleski's ear re. putting Victory's beers in CANs for the umpteenth time. I had been heartened as Tom Kehoe of Yards assured me that he was into the idea, but numerous factors came into play (sidebar: the new Yards facility WILL have a CANning line) &amp; so I felt emboldened. Bill, who is usually one of the most even-keeled, long-tempered brewers that I know, suddenly wheeled &amp; roared,  WOODY, STOP IT WITH THE CANS! VICTORY BEERS WILL BE IN CANS WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER! NOT ANOTHER WORD, UNDERSTOOD?!?  Upon leaving, I rang up my broker &amp; secured the sole proprietorship on any and all cold-weather gear sold in Hades. Today, I am a rich man, while Bro. Bill is merely sheepish. BTW, he really likes when I recount that tale!  From the CAN:    I Crack!ed open the CAN to loud applause from beneath my chair. I guess that the residents of H-E-double-toothpick are likewise glad to see Victory beers in CANtained aluminum cylinders! I was greeted by a brimful CAN that immediately began foaming through the vent in an instance of Covaleski's Revenge. I allowed it to settle before performing a gentle Glug which was enough to satiate us all. I watched as it formed a finger of dense, foamy, bone-white head of its own accord &amp; then evinced great retention. Color was a gorgeous Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5), like liquid sunshine of which I was about to take a sip, at least I was until the arrival of The Gelt Gang - Croesus, Midas &amp; Mammon, all wanting some Golden goodness of their own. Nose had a pronounced spiciness, but not the usual Pumpkin/Hallowe'en/Holiday spices. No, instead, this was coriander, black pepper, star anise &amp; dried orange peel! Oh my. Mouthfeel was full, thick &amp; creamy as though a dollop had been ladled onto my tongue by a trollop. The taste was wonderfully spicy, very peppery, but with a light citrusiness &amp; a dry mustiness that could only have been borne of Belgian yeast.   This was evocative of our initial foray to the then-nascent brewpub in Downingtown, via train from Lancaster. It seemed like a long walk from the train station at the time, but now, il n'est pas rien. As we were leaving, a fellow guest offered to give us a ride up Lancaster Avenue to the train station &amp; thus unburdened, we purchased a growler of Golden Monkey which we passed around like a jug of hooch on the train. Upon debarking in Lancaster, we had to be poured off of the train!   The finish was spicy, yeasty &amp; very dry. I kept getting intense peppery notes, even well after the swallow.   If you like white wine &amp; CANnot find it in a CAN, I humbly offer this up as a (possibly) suitable substitute. Its presence in a CAN means that you CAN put it next to your boyfriend's CANs of TenFidy in the cooler as you head to the beach, never to be heard from again as the surf gently pulls your slumbering bodies out to sea.","  rDev Pours a deep golden color with a one inch inch white head that was well retained. Smells and tastes of bready yeast (not quite the classic Belgian yeast however), clove, orange, spices and an overall sweetness. Medium body and carbonation and the ABV was well hidden.","  rDev A very good looking and tasty beer. Nice aroma and smooth drinking. The back end leaves it a bit less desirable than some other tripels I've had but otherwise a good beer. On draft at Ron's Corner Tavern.","  rDev Beer does what it says and pours a golden, slightly hazy color. Head is a thin ring with dashes and dots, slight moss on top.   Aromas of lemon cake and mint, with a little bit of salt.   Some peppery yeast and clove, burnt popcorn, blueberry, shortbread, more burnt popcorn, and a touch of diacetyl.   Feel is clean and crisp, with a slight hotness from the alcohol.  Overall, a decent Tripel. Nothing spectacular but better than most of the reviews would suggest."]},{"Name":"Storm King","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/345/1013/","Brewery":"Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":9.10,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter.

All that talking must've done some good, because Victory decided to bring this one back for this year. My last beer to close out a wonderful Chirstmas I just had. Let's crack it open  Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  Upon first whiff of this, there's no question that this an old school Imperial Stout, just loaded with bitter roasty aromas. I'm picking up on aromas of charred toast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, acidic coffee, earthy hops, and light toffee  Oof, it's possibly even more roasty in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, bitter coffee, earthy hops, toffee, and light grapefruit rind. The swallow brings notes of char, caramel malt, toast, dark chocolate, herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and acidic coffee  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a roasty and bitter beer.

Aromas huge hops and plenty of roasted barley are overpowering at first, but some milk chocolate and faint dark roast coffee sneak in as the beer sits; very light tones of vanilla beans and toasted nuts come through intermittently.  Taste follows the aroma, bringing huge hops and bitter herbal notes leading to big roasted barley, raw coffee and dark chocolate that all smooths excellently as it warms; faint bits of toasted wood and a fleeting vanilla bean tone are invited in sparingly on the back end; hoppy edge is never abandoned, though.  Mouthfeel shows a robust body that nears hearty if it weren’t for a tinge of bitterness taking some of the heft away; balanced all-around but still burly, with minimal alcohol presence and a very dry finish that suits this stout’s profile nicely.  Burly hoppiness even for a straight-up, old-school imperial stout, and that was clearly the point. Admittedly, it’s overpowering at first, but increasingly welcoming as time passes and it warms. Well-done as an aggressive stout; I feel like I’d enjoy it even more with a few years of age on it.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb 8/21/23 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 9.1% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with milk chocolate colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is a mixture of bitter chocolate, roasty malts and earthy hops. The taste is bitter first with coffee, dark chocolate, ash and some earthy hop flavor coming out after the initial shock. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, good. Big bitterness here, but no trace of the high ABV.

The aroma has some dark chocolate mixed with some hop citrus (orange?). As time goes on, the citrus fades and there is some coffee undercurrent noted. The taste hits with a big blast of burnt roast, followed by some anise and espresso notes, with some citrus and piney hops noted in the finish and aftertaste. As it warms, the espresso qualities are more apparent, but the hop finish does not disappear. The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation medium low . An interesting concoction. A hoppy stout if you will. I wonder what it would taste like in 2023.","  rDev From notes 3/2/12: Pours ebony with a huge 3+ finger, moderately lasting, mixed coarse/fie foam, mocha head that leaves clumpy, sticky lacing across the glass.

Some sweet dark fruit and vanilla participate. The end is, as described, the espresso darkness, not really bitter, but rich and thick. Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation for style. Quite smooth throughout. A hop heavy, rich tasting stout that provides some complex layers of taste. It has been a few years since I sampled this, but previously, this was my favorite heavy hopped stout. The experience is as I remembered.","  rDev Pitch black, small head  This imperial stout is really old school and very different from what you got right now.

Price: $2.52 with 10 percent off for a variety 6-pack  Purchased: Nov. 2, 2017 Consumed: Nov. 2, 2017 Reviewed as: American Double/Imperial Stout Misc.: Enjoy by Aug. 28, 2022  Picked this up on my monthly visit to Bine &amp; Vine, along with a bunch of other stuff. Picked it up without really knowing anything about it or a canned on date. Usually two no-no’s for me. Hoping to be surprised. Thought I liked Victory a little more until I just looked at my ratings. Only one of my eight previous reviews had at least a 4 and it was exactly a 4 (Headwaters Pale Ale). Quick look and most of these reviews were in 2011, my first year starting. Would certainly like to try a few of those again. Anyway, bottle read, “A thundering hop presence collides with massive espresso and dark chocolate notes in this full-bodied imperia stout.”   Poured a pitch black color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Could see a few bubbles sneaking up along the sides of the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)  Smelled dark chocolate syrup, mocha, malt chocolate, caramel, hazelnut, espresso, char wood, burnt coffee, roasty malts and crayon. Had me wanting to try it. (Smell - 4.00)   Taste followed the nose for the most part, but no hiding that 9.1 pct. ABV. Got dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, char wood, toasty hazelnut, burnt coffee, dark cacao powder, roasted barley, anise and burnt popcorn. (Taste - 4.00)  Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt bitter finish. (Feel - 3.75)  Just a solid double stout. Outstanding. (Overall - 4.00)  4.01 | 90 | A-","  rDev The appearance is pitch black. A semi-aggressive pour yields a huge two-finger creamy tan head. The retention is moderate--after a few minutes, the head dies down to a thin half-finger tan film, but plenty of lacing is left behind. The nose is big, roasted, and bitter. It smells of unsweetened baking cocoa, beef broth/soy sauce, wet dirt, black licorice, pine, star anise, coffee grounds. The palate opens up with dark chocolate, a bit of toffee, blackberry, and molasses--just slightly sweet--before a massive wall of roasted malt and hop bitterness overtakes the palate. The dark chocolate transitions into baking cocoa, black licorice, star anise, and black coffee. Super hoppy as well, there's a ton of earth and pine. Slightly metallic as well, like copper. There's a bit of soy sauce and umami, but the massive bitterness steals the show, with the bitterness of black coffee, dark chocolate and pine leading long into the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium-full, nice and well-rounded, mostly full, but the lively carbonation makes it quite drinkable. Overall, a really good stout. Dangerously drinkable. If you prefer your stouts burnt and bitter, this one's for you!","  rDev (I've had this one so many times in the past but for some reason never took the time to review it.)  A - Pitch black pour with thick and frothy toffee colored head. Sticks to the sides of the glass like glue.  S - Dark roasted chocolate with some cream and light charcoal.  T - Dark roasted malt, alcohol, very roasty throughout and ends with a sharp piney lingering bitterness that scrubs some of the malt off the palate.  M - Big and robust with a creamy texture.  O - Just an outstanding stout, hands down. So glad this is available year around!","  rDev Pour is black-ish, looks almost like a big porter, plenty of light leaking around the edges, with a tan head.  Aromas are HEAVY hops, some sharp coffee, and chocolate. The taste is very hop forward - more so than I’ve experienced in any big stout, ever - with a lot of bitterness from the coffe flavors, and subtle chocolate notes.  And it works. It’s a bit thin for a 9.1% ABV beer, and it’s sorta like a black DIPA, but it works. Glad I finally got to try it.","  rDev Black with a creamy and lasting tan head that leaves sheets of lacing.   Coffee and bakers chocolate up front in the nose, with molasses, plum and umami coming on strong as it warms.  Super rich, dark and bitter tasting. Roasted, almost smokey, chocolatey malts stand out at first once again. There's a strong wallop of fruit and umami, as well, maybe a flash of licorice, and then a hint of coffee, chicory and wood mid-palate. Chocolate/ coffee bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.  Nice, full-bodied, creamy feel.  The umami could be dialed down half a notch, but overall, this is delicious.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours black with a medium tan head. Aroma of rich malt, licorice, dark chocolate, coffee, and roast. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter. Full bodied with soft carbonation.","  rDev I haven't had many Victory brews, but this one might be my favorite...  I've seen plenty of stouts pour out a black liquid, but that was until today. This quite possibly might have be the blackest of them all, truly black, as in it poured black and it stayed black even when held up to the light - impressive in my book. The smell was a sweet booziness that honestly made my mouth water. Though it was more carbonated that I would have liked, it was certainly smooth and the carbonation wasn't as strong as it got warm. This could have been an opulent brew, if it were not for the hops they used that gave it a slightly metallic tang (and an even stronger one as an aftertaste.) Nonetheless, overlooking this one flaw, it really is a darn good beer. Too bad I only had one of these to partake.","  rDev Pours almost black with a half inch tan head that left a little lacing. Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, slightly burnt malts and a distinct hop presence. Taste follows the nose with additional notes of spices and brown sugar. Light bodied for the style, lightly carbonated, smooth and creamy mouth feel.","  12oz bottle to my Barrelhouse Brewing snifter glass From notes – 11/15/15  A highly hopped RIS that barely clinches a balance to the burnt and roasted malt character.  Fairly viscous on the pour revealing a dark black-bean colored body with just a smidge of dark brown to the edges. Pulls out any light none the less. Thin blanket of creamy beige whip cream over top that subsides out to ring the glass. Presents a few small dots and streaks of lace. Bittersweet chocolate and equal parts coffee roast on the nose with some dark bread, berry fruit, and nutty caramels. There is a distinct fruity pine and herbal spice hop note along with some modest alcohol presence. One of the hoppiest stouts encountered yet and I rather enjoy it. Has a nice fruity element that compliments the coffee berries and cocoa powder. Further balanced with some toasted grain and brown sugar sweetness. The body is thinner than expected and this has a moderate amount of roast bitterness that creeps in by the finish lifting and drying into a lasting aftertaste of coffee, spice hops, and dark roasted grans. Alcohol is lightly rapping on the door. This one really tests the limits of balance with its near acrid qualities yet highly drinkable experience.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Very dar brown color, with a thin beige head but good lacing. Interesting and pleasant smell, almost lemony. Taste is of coffee, chocolate and raisins, with ginger and molasses. Very nice.","  rDev I can only rate this in the here and now, but the bottle has a best by date of February, 2017. Dont know what that translates to in terms of bottle date.  Poured into a tulip an inky black with a bit of beige stout type head that fell to nothing.  Aroma is certainly absent any hop character. It is fig/date brown dried fruit, molasses, coffee, roast malt, and a note I cant pick out from the smell alone.  The taste is quite smooth, coffee, dried sweet fruit, brown sugar, molasses. There is an aftertaste that becomes easy to pick out as the beer warms, and it is licorice. Generally not a flavor I like in a stout, but this is in the aftertatse and it is clear but not overwhelming candy. More like licorice root or fennel.  The feel is oily, minimal carbonation, slick and smooth with the spicy note of the licorice livening things up.  Overall,this is a very good stout as consumed. I cant comment on a fresh bottle. Very good and would not hesitate to age this one even further.","  rDev It is almost perfectly opaque black, with just a small hint of brown. The head is light tan and holds on at about half a finger. It leaves rings and sheets of sticky lacing. The aroma is a big blast of deep roasted malts and some alcohol sweetness. The taste is similar with a bit of earthy hops. The body is lighter with a silky feel and a little warmth on the finish.","  rDev Well here it is, review #2500, a review of a beer that used to sit at #1 on the all time beer list, before rarity and price became the prerequisites for 98% of the beer list. BeerAdvocate shark jump, 2010 I think. . .   Anyways, this gem pours black as night. Without a moon. Hits that awesome over 1  of head, looking crimson deep burnt red on it. Aroma hit chocolate, roast, coffee notes.  This one floats seamlessly through the genres of stout, some irish dry aspect, the lactose in a small way of a milk stout, the heft of an imperial stout, the dark fruit of a russian imperial stout. Chewy, mild cherry tobacco notes. I have a barrel aged version I've been meaning to check out.   Anyways, classic stuff, no adjunct stout from back in the day."]},{"Name":"Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/38470/","Brewery":"Stone Brewing","Style":"IPA - Black / Cascadian Dark Ale","Alcohol":8.70,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev ** 01/22/22  can to snifter.

Smells of quite roasted, slightly caramelly malt and resinous, citrus hops, with notes of chocolate, coffee, grapefruit and pine. Taste is a perfect balance of quite roasted, slightly caramelly malt and fruity, bitter and resinous hops, with citrus and lighter tropical notes of grapefruit, lime peel and pineapple, as well as some chocolate, coffee and pine, with hints of licorice and tobacco as well. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and some roasted malt, coffee, grapefruit and resinous pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  I've been really looking forward to this and it certainly didn't disappoint, probably the best Black IPA I've ever had, which is one of my favorite styles. It just gets that balance of roasted, chocolately malt and bitter, resinous hops just right, with those citrus and spice notes adding layers of depth and complexity to this. Even at 4 months old, those aggressive, bitter and resinous hops still stand out and I especially love those strong, distinct resinous pine notes here. If this is still this bitter and resinous at 4 months old, it must be an absolute revelation when fresh, which is why I have adjusted my score slightly upwards, although I can still very much enjoy the balance of roasted, bitter and sweet notes at this age. An oustanding example of the style that is both aggressive and well-balanced at the same time.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, RVA12/29/20, EJBY04/28/21; purchased single off shelf at Total Wine... poured into a fat tulip)  L: deep, dark ruby liquid with decent clarity; tall, slow-receding, dense-creamy, tan foam... keeps a messy, broken cap; some flares of lace to and fro  S: piney weed, spicy (blood) orange peel, berry taffy, pine cleaner... later, it settles into a potpourri-ed polyester weathered classic car upholstery   T: caramelized cereal grain, floral light-roast coffee bean, hint of cacao extract; xmas tree finish, highlighted by the ghosts of citrus (bitter white grapefruit)... aftertaste is predominantly herbal, grassy, citrus-pithy bitterness and a fair bit of roasted, toasty malt, but little (rounded) sweetness; so, relatively cleaved dry with begging moreishness... the alcohol gradually adds a sharp edge to the bracing bitter  F: taut, dextrinous texture with layers of electric resins finely buzzing... not the least bit of syrupy viscosity, let alone sticky oils... the bitterness and alcohol provide an almost capsicum heat... about as chill and smooth as it gets at this IBU/ABV; how is this improved?

Glad this is back. There's no commonly available classic version of this style. Black with a huge khaki head. Smells of grapefruit, toasted malt, and light coffee malts. Tastes of sweet caramel and roasted malt for a brief moment before an aggressive grapefruit hop kicks in. Dominates the profile for a bit, becoming bitter and pithy. Back end exhibits some chocolate sweetness and lingering bitterness. Medium body. Aggressive and flavorful. A nice blast from the past and not a beer I've had in years. I probably didn't notice it was gone, but its hiatus reminded me of its quality.","  rDev Rerate, 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.7%. Very dark brown colour, nearly black. Large beige head. Dryish roasty aroma blends in with some fruity hoppy notes, hints of liquorice and sea water. Medium sweet flavour with distinct roasty notes, strong coffee, hints of liquorice and chocolate, followed by a very hoppy finish with resinous and grapefruity notes.

Aromas of citrus, coffee, char, and caramel malt.   The brew is fleetingly sweet and roasty on the tip of the tongue before citrus and char provide a counterpoint. Just a bit of booze at the finish.  Quite heavy bodied, but the carbonation keeps this off the deck.  About as tasty a Cascadian as I've had.","  rDev Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a dark cola color with a large, creamy, light khaki head and a thick coating of lacing. The smell is malty with notes of citrus, coffee, chocolate, and tobacco. The taste opens with sweetness on the tip of the tongue: roasted malt, dark chocolate, and freshly-brewed coffee. On the back end it's earthy, strongly bitter and slightly acidic. There is lots of resinous pine. The Chinook, Simcoe, and Amarillo hops are on full display. The flavors are big and bold but well balanced. Its mouth feel is moderate in thickness and carbonation and the 8.7% ABV gives it good substance. It doesn't drink like a big beer but you have to pace yourself. Overall, this is one of the best Black IPAs I've had the pleasure to drink. It's only slightly below Carton's Epitome, which is not just my favorite beer of the style but one of my favorite beers period.","  rDev So happy this beer is back! Hope it stays a while and brings friends!   Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Clear dark brown color with nice fluffy beige head and good curtain lacing. Citrus smell and taste. Pleasant earthy bitterness. Very nice roasted malt flavors. Great beer with food. Like I said, I hope to have it available for a while!","  rDev Pretty harsh and bitter but I expected that for the style and for Stone.","  rDev Bottled 12/29/20  This beer seems to be having quite a moment right now. It hasn't been brewed in a few years, and many demanded that Stone bring it back. They finally have, and I'm excited to try it for the first time  Pours a very dark brown with mild ruby highlights and 2 fingers of creamy light brown head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  The nose shows a subtle but enticing juxtaposition between the oily hops and the dark malts. I'm picking up on aromas of dark toast, lightly acidic coffee, dank oily hops, pithy grapefruit, rich chocolate malt, and a hint of smoke  The taste loses a bit of the balance, but it is still tasty. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting oily hops, dark bread, and smooth roasty coffee. The swallow brings notes of intense herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and a touch of sweet malt for balance  A medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a beer that's both dry and silky on the way down, ultra drinkable for the abv. Finishes dry and bitter  This was good, but nothing mind blowing. It just seems like a typical Stone IPA but just with dark malts. That being said, it's good for what it is and I could see myself getting it again","  rDev 12oz bottle, EJBY04/28/21 It’s been way to long since I had this one! I was super excited to see it back for a limited time!!

Bitter &amp; roasty - one of the best in one of my favorite beer styles.","  rDev My word... This one pops like when Vana White takes an extra dose of Adderall and spins a letter around. I mean, we are talking wabam! Whoa... I almost need sometime to settle myself here. First sip is like getting rear ended in a pinto - ayyyyyyyy! Ok, I’m ok (I think). The thang is just beautiful and striking like a midnight walk seaside with Elsa Hosk.  I’m done.","  rDev Excellent head production, retention, and lacing. Body is superbly clear but equally black. Whether or not this beer is sublime remains to be seen, but the appearance is nearly flawless.  Citrus notes and dank herbs from the hops, atop a chocolate and licorice expression from the malt body. Fairly restrained on the nose overall. Lemon zest, toast, lime juice, molasses, toast, pine, caramel, and brown sugar round out the profile. I'd prefer an even more expressive hop presence for a Black IPA, but that's quibbling.  A touch thick on the palate, but still lively and very drinkable. Dark malts up front, before the hops weigh in; this starts a dance that would continue through the rest of the sip, with rich malt tones trading off with citrus and pine hop notes for dominance at any given time. Licorice, toast, espresso, cola, and bitter chocolate from the malt; lemon zest, orange, pine, and bark from the hops. Just a hint of leather and grass. Semi-dry and effervescent finish.  This is almost exactly what I want from an IPA in terms of balance: bold, bitter, with the hops as the showcase and the malts adding a unique depth and complexity. If the execution is imperfect, you can certainly hearken back the long years to when this recipe was first formulated, and recognize the majority of the most popular hop varietals today didn't then exist. Really well balanced and well executed overall.","  rDev 12oz bottle stamped RVA 12/29/20 EJB 04/28/21 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 8.7% ABV.

Taste is floral, grassy, and piney hops, along with the dark char of the malts. A little bit sweet but the dark malts, along with the pine, comes in at the end to cover this up. The aftertaste continues the dark hoppiness. Has a lingering flavor akin to a chocolate grapefruit. Chewy, with a medium mouth feel. Causes some numbness to the tongue. Dry finish. Very good carbonation. Because of the rareness of black IPAs in today's market it is good to see this re-release. This beer is so different from all the sweet and juicy IPAs and the pastry stouts.

Taste- Dark roast and pine forward followed by solid floral notes and a hint of char in the finish.   Feel- Oily and quite thick like an oatmeal stout with a semi dry finish.

Stone released this in their Mixed 12 Pack, paired with their classic Stone IPA, Ruination Double 2.0, and their new seasonal Citruy Wit. It pours nearly jet black with about a 1/2 inch head and heavy lacing. You get a mild hoppy, resinous aroma initially, but the first sip is a sweet and hoppy burst of flavor, complimented by bready, malty notes that finishes with a subtle pine flavor that does an incredible job of balancing out the full flavor of this beer.

I'm picking up on aromas of toasted oak, pecan, creamy vanilla, espresso beans, brown bread, and subtle milk chocolate (4.25-&gt;4.5)  Honestly this tastes pretty similar to what I have noted from the fresh bottle, just a little less roasty and charred. Maybe it could actually use some more time in this regard (4-&gt;4)  The body remains identical here, but I do think it deserves a slight bump up from before (4-&gt;4.25)  Overall this has to go (4-&gt;4.25).

Pours dark brown to black, with a one finger tan head. Nose is caramel, taste is caramel, quite sweet, almost no bitterness, but boozy. Decent mouthfeel, overall excellent. Boozier and tastier than most brown ales.","  rDev Poured from a single-serve into a tulip...  Pours a porter-stout-like opaque dark brown to black. A vigorous pour yielded a substantial tan foamy head. The head and lacing persist fairly well.   The nose is fairly malty and toasty, with expected wood notes. The booze is noticeable here.  The flavor is all over the map. Big chewy malts in the form of caramel and molasses immediately hit the palate, followed by a strong raw booze note. Earthy hop notes balance the malts fairly well, though this skews pretty sweet. Very barleywine-like or even old ale, with a barrel note that arrives in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is solid and well-matched. Definitely chewy and full-bodied, it nevertheless delivers just enough hop and booze to balance things out. And the carbonation is unexpected given the ABV.  This isn't a  brown  in the conventional sense at all. Very barleywine in many ways, although less hoppy than most iterations of that style. If the booze was a bit more hidden it would be a top-notcher. Still, a good brew.","  rDev L: I've never seen a brown that looked so much like a porter or possibly even a stout. It's very dark brown and just a bit of light adds some color to the body. The head is a smallish, thin one but tightly bubbled, leaving spotting on the glass behind a thin leg. S: You can smell a bit of alcohol, but the barrel adds a lot of character. Good wood with some caramel and vanilla sweetness over a bit of light roast. T:This one is balanced, not too sweet, and very tasty. The only thing that detracts is the strength of the raw sort of alcohol, and this might be the perfect brown ale without it. As such, it's excellent, with lots of complexity, bread and just enough of a leafy / earthy / almost nutty hops presence to counter the sweetness. Wood adds a nice dryness that doesn't take it overboard or go astringent. F: This is one that could be very dry, and overly so, between the alcohol and wood but doesn't. It has a bit more body than the typical brown without being heavy and balances crispness and smoothness very nicely.","  rDev Pours black with a finger and half of khaki foam with marvelous head retention. Aroma is toasted, nutted, breaded, and caramel malts with soothing oak. Flavor profile is toasted, roasted, nutted, breaded, and caramel malts. It has a wonderfully diverse quality to it, all the while, remaining balanced. Touches of caramel, oak, and molasses help smooth things out even further burying any sign of the 12% ABV. Mouth feel is velvety, smooth, and creamy with a medium thickness. Overall, a splendid beer that retains a world class balance. It drinks quite a bit like a stout, but a balanced stout at that. Lovely brew.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Well, it looks pitch black in the glass, topped by a creamy tan head. Looks more like an imperial stout than a brown ale. The head retention and lacing are incredible for an abv of 12%, so it looks magnificent.  It smells like an imperial stout, too. It smells like dark chocolate, baking cocoa, espresso, licorice, molasses, black pepper. Slightly butter, too, with hints of soy sauce. Smells delectable.  Huge dark and milk chocolate upfront with some caramel and toffee. Big creaminess with vanilla and almond notes. Spicy mid-palate notes of black pepper, licorice, star anise. Slightly smoky. Hints of prune and raisin. A little bit of soy sauce. Finishes slightly sweet but not cloying, alcohol extremely well-hidden, just a warmth going down.  The mouthfeel on this beer is world-class. So silky-smooth, soft, and velvety. Super creamy, but not thick, chewy, or heavy. Moderately carbonated. Flows quickly on the palate but doesn't want to leave your mouth, either. Finishes slightly sticky with some residual sweetness.  Wow! This beer blew my mind. I'm not sure what to expect from the Palo Santo wood, and it tastes more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, but wow, what a magnificent beer. This is absolutely stellar.","  rDev This might be the best DFH I've ever had...Damn is it tasty...  I knew there was something special about this beer when I read it was a brown ale but it poured out more like a liquid, black stout. It had thin foam, light lacing, but the impenetrable blackness of the beer was impressive. The scent was a pleasant blend of caramel, roasted notes, and the distinct booziness that comes with 12% ABV. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, somewhat creamy, and more carbonated than I prefer but not to the point of distraction. The taste was anything like a brown ale - this was more a flavorful stout if anything. Though the booziness was the strong note, there were background flavors of vanilla and caramel, with a touch of roasted malts to round it all up.   What an incredible and unexpected surprise from a brewer I thought I had already pegged. Nice job DFH...","  rDev Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is slightly sweet caramel with a little vanilla. Taste is a caramel vanilla with a strong alcohol taste. This beer definitely needs to be aged for 6-12 months","  rDev As others wrote:  Finally good use of brown ale . Brown ale rocks when imperial.  My only fault with it is it's too sweet be a degree.  a) Lasting two finger mocha head on a black body which pours thick and laces in deep sheets. s) faint compared with its massive flavor wave. Malts of caramel, toffee, earthy hops and charred and oiled wood. t) Starts with a candy bar of vanilla, mocha and caramel. Then complex with wood, oiled wood, church incense, earthy hops, fall forest floor and finishing bitter in a nice clean up. Not too boozy. f) It's thick, oily, a meditation beer with moderate carbonation and wine like tautness.  o) Up there with Foxtrot.","  rDev Forms a dark coffee-walnut brown body with a thin ring of 1/2 finger.   Aroma is not very strong, but has hints of wet wood and coffee. Some very light carafe.   Flavor is mostly blackberry coffee, then antiseptic, followed with wet wood, plum, and then a finish of vanilla and pepper. Flavor is pretty washed out over what I expected.   Feel is burning, carbonated, crisp, with a semi-dry finish.   Overall, a bit underwhelming, but I'm sure it will grow bigger with age. (It's good, just...the hype and price point...ya know)","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a snifter  A- pours a deep brown color with a creamy khaki head that has great retention.   S- smells of dark bread crust, caramel, toffee, chocolate, exotic wood, toasted nuts, leather and tobacco   T- rich caramel and toffee up front, followed by notes of chocolate, fig, raisin, prime, tobacco and dark bread crust. The finish brings out some wood notes that continue into the linger, along with more caramel   M- medium thick body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel and a chewy, warming finish   O- for a style that's typically bland, this is bold and flavorful throughout, very good","  rDev 12oz bottled 12/6/16 poured into a DFH wood aged glass at fridge temp 12% ABV. The beer is dark brown bordering on black. The head is short lived and light brown in color. Head recedes to a few islands of bubbles and a faint ring around the glass. Aroma is chocolate and roast malt with a hint of wood. Taste follows the nose with chocolate and roast up front yielding to woody, spicy boozy notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied, barely carbonated, soft yet sharp with boozy bitterness on the finish. It all works together quite well. Overall, very good. This is a rather extraordinary beer to just be able to look up a local store on the DFH website and purchase without trouble.","  rDev This beer pours a deep black with a smallish head. The aroma features notes of vanilla, toasted oak, milk chocolate, mild smoke, salami, and licorice. The flavor starts with a strong note of chocolate, and then vanilla, licorice, toast, salami, pepperoni, and rye bread. The mouthfeel is quite thick with fairly minimal carbonation. Overall this is lovely and deep beer with innate complexity,","  rDev Color is dark brown bordering on black. There's a smattering tan bubbles across the top. Has a sweet and roasty aroma consisting of cacao, cinnamon, brown sugar, plum and roasted malts. Tastes of deep rich caramel, roasted malt, currant, cacao, gum, herbal hops and wood, all taking their perfect positions on the stage. Smooth and goes down more like a 6 per-center. Complex and concerted.   Just when you think it's safe to forget the big guys, you find a beer like this and realize why they will always have their place at the table.","  rDev It pours jet black and without much in terms of a head. The smell is intense and full of oaky and vinous notes. The taste is more of a barrel-aged stout than any kind of brown ale, but I guess this beer is something in between. Fairly boozy. A great dessert!","  rDev First off this is an incredible beer but I'm reviewing it nitro style at the brewery Look - incredibly dark with a big lasting tan head Smell - I feel like the nitro changed the smell, smells like modified Guinness Taste - sweet brown mixed with a stout Feel - smooth creamy Overall - I'll review again not nitro because it's better not nitro","  rDev ** 04/13/17  Bottle to snifter.  I had this 6-7 years ago before I started recording most of my ratings, but I remember thinking it had an odd taste and I did not like it. Trying it this time, I think it's not as off-putting as before, but I still don't love it. I appreciate the strength and also the experimentation with the Brown Ale style which I like. Glad I tried it again  LOOK: very dark brown (almost black). Medium head fades quickly into some minor lacing. AROMA: the wood dominates, maybe some vinegar or strange oils. Some roasted malt. TASTE: a touch of raisin comes through, but otherwise it is the wood and strong oily taste which I can only imagine comes from the Palo Santo wood. FEEL: Medium to Full bodied. Light carbonation due to thickness. Smooth mouthfeel, but some astringency from the wood characteristics.   ** 12/13/18  Bottle to sniffer.  Giving this another shot. Mostly because I want to see what some age will do. This bottle is the 1st of a 4pack, bottled 10/24/18.  I agree with my notes from above, but maybe I was a bit harsh on the numbers.  this is a pretty good beer that is , at this point in its life, a little rough around the edges and unrefined. Hoping age will mellow it. The 12% should allow quality aging. **","  rDev Pours like a imp stout...near black with short but thick and creamy brown head with good retention and lace. Nose is sweet roasted malt, a bit like brown bread and some woody notes. Taste is on the sweet side like a barleywine. Not overly boozy for 12%, although I've had this mellowing in the cellar for a year. Vanilla, chewy raisin, and again a light woody note. Overall, a good beer, but I was hoping for a bit more complexity rather than just going big on the malt and ABV. I'd certainly call this a barleywine and not a brown ale.","  rDev 1/25/17....pours deep dark brown, fast tan foam that settles out. Woodsy red wine nose, backed by a roasted stout aroma. Rich thick stout taste, with a whisky like complexity. Vanilla cinnamon throughout, and with a chewy oaked flavor. Quite potent and unique. And technically a Brown Ale at that!","  rDev On tap in Greenville, SC.  Opaque dark brown body with a decent beige head. A generous amount of dark roasted grains helps this achieve partially hidden alcohol. Alcohol is obvious, but not quite harsh, in the feel, and the flavor is more than a touch boozy: just enough to hur my ratings on both dimensions.","  rDev I like the pour, brown from the wood, decent lighter brown lace around the glass. Forms a delightful smoky woody and vanilla vibe. At this point, I thought all my DFH jokes were blowing up in my face, this is a nice beer to start out thus far.   The taste though hits like a shot of cheap whiskey. Hot. Like that water sealant you use on your wooden deck. Just really the alcohol cuts through this one hot and heavy, the viscosity of the beer doesn't seem to be enough to hold up. I like the aroma and what it shows you can do with barrel aging, but beyond that its a rough one."]},{"Name":"Sip Of Sunshine","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17980/117177/","Brewery":"Lawson's Finest Liquids","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":8.00,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev Rich, golden amber body; nice carbonation; thick head, dense, white, semi-creamy.

The pour created a frothy and airy two-fingered head with fair retention. The somewhat quick dissipation left some lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, pale gold with amber yellow hues. The beer has clarity, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing around.  The aromas are passion fruit, pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, toasted bread crust, resin, pine needles, floral esters, and earthiness.   The flavors are mango, pineapple, orange peel, a hint of grapefruit, toasted crackers, bready, floral ester, phenols, pine needles, malty sweetness, and earthiness.

The beer is bright and crisp with the right amount of astringency. Awesome beer!","  rDev On tap at the Tavern Downtown in Hartford, CT.  This beer did not blow me away and so I thought about why folks might be giving it the ratings that they do. In part, it is because this beer has a reputation as being one of the early great Imperial IPAs. For me what makes this a great beer is that it has retained its original profile, which is certainly more west coast IPA than anything found in Vermont. The bitterness is not over the top, but its just enough to balance the 8% ABV to make you think you're drinking a beer with much less alcohol. Pliny and Ruination are better, but this is a great beer.","  rDev Pours a slightly hazy golden honey color with a big fluffy white head that left some sticky lacing on the glass.  The aroma is big on floral hops, fresh. Pineapple notes, perhaps some mango.  The taste is of the tropical hop flavors, pineapple and mango. I get a bit of a grassy bitterness. The malt is bready and provides some honey sweetness.  The feel is of a solid malt body. Great balance between sweet and bitter. 8% ABV well hidden. Drinks easy for a bigger beer.  Very nice double IPA that drinks too easy.","  rDev Served in a teku glass from the can.   Appearance: semi clear amber color with a lighter carbonation. White head initially did rise a notch over one finger's length.   Smell: slight pine feel which dissipates quickly.   Taste: Touch sweet citrus with grapefruit skin.   Mouth: Medium to full carbonation with an extra sticky body.   Overall: Good brew, west coat style ipa which sticks to your palates and is a huge thirst quencher.","  rDev First time seeing Lawson in my local six pack shop! Great tasting hop profile smooth herbal dank yet balanced. Kind of worth the hype but to me I could probably find smoother local IPA's. Still was glad to pick one up for around 5 bucks to try!","  rDev Canned 9/17/20, just over 2 weeks old  It's always an honor to try a beer sitting in the top 250, and this is currently #59. For as highly rated as this, it is very widely available in my area, and I'm not really sure why I haven't gotten around to trying it yet tbh. Regardless, here we are now  Pours a mostly clear orange gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that reduces to a cap slowly and leaves patchy lacing  The aroma is sticky and tropical, loaded with notes of juicy tangerine, cantaloupe, crystal malt, oily resiny hops, and an earthy peppery spice that ties it all together. The nose here is reminiscent of some of the best NEIPAs, just a touch more earthy  This is really gentle and balanced in taste, way more so than I was expecting. It starts off with soft malts and subtle tropical fruitiness, maybe just a hint of tart orange. On the swallow this turns brighter with both fruit and hops being dialed up. Instead of just being piney, the hops are very floral in a way I can't accurately describe. This combines with notes of sweet melon and papaya for an excellent balance  A medium body with very mild carbonation leads to a very smooth drink at 8%. Finishes mostly dry but still coats the mouth, letting you know that it has serious strength in flavor  This was a really good and well balanced beer. World class? Nahh, but very very good. I'll definitely be on the lookout for. double and triple sunshine now!","  rDev Pours a huge head, fills half the pint glass, a kind of orange tinted tan, mottled surface, credible retention, wispy lacing. Softly gauzy liquid, coppery orange, curiously few visible bubbles, what’s there more clear beads. Taut nose of grapefruit pith, peppercorns, cracker and coal tar, the damp herbal matter stays fresh and doesn’t weight things down in the nostrils, the papaya, mango, apricot fruit strikes me as more dry than juicy. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied, good firmness, and a steady carbonated churn keeps it moving. “Juicier” here but not juicy per se, still plenty of fruit flavor of the tropical stripe. Not discerning much florality nor pine. Tangerine citrus leads the way for a mix of white and pink grapefruit. Dankness equally clean here. Pine notes through the finish. Its relative dryness almost makes it drink like a “throwback” IPA. (Canned 8/8/20)","  rDev 16oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a good-sized, white head of foam. It left beautiful sticky rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of grapefruit, orange peel, mango and toasted caramel.

S: Fruitiness then comes forth with aromas of white grapefruit, lemon, and caramel as well as a subtle pine note. T: More semisweet than semidry. Palate follows nose closely but with a predominance of lemon and caramel. Bitterness evident throughout and balancing sweetness elements nicely. M: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very, very easy drinking. O: Sip of Sunshine characterizes it well: and oddly light, refreshing, fun and flavorful DIPA. Could have another right now.","  rDev 32oz crowler into a pint glass. Picked up at sabatinis in Exeter pa this past Thursday.  Looks excellent in the glass. Clear but slightly dull golden colored body. Small white head shrinks to a ring and covering, yet still manages to leave some attractive lacing. Barely detectable tiny streams of carbonation.  Dull tropical fruit aroma with the occasional spike of citrus.  Upon tasting, it's initially fiercely bitter. But some complexity comes through during the mouth. Some lemon, faintly catty, a sweet malt base, some non citrus tropical fruit. Over all of this is a lasting bitterness.  Mouth closer to full than medium, finish lastingly bitter with the occasional swirl of sweetness.  Overall, it's a fiercely aggressive drink with some balanced tones. Wouldn't want a session of these, but once in a while, this would be a drink to muse over.","  rDev 16 oz can at Pennsport. Medium golden, light haze, spotty head. Aroma features light hoppy notes, caramel. Taste did not wow me at first, given this beer's rep. It did creep up on me as I made my way through, tropical fruit notes, toffee, light floral and herbal accents. Slick, full mouthfeel Lingering bitterness.","  rDev Appearance - The poured a golden yellow color with a white head that left modest lacing.   Smell - The nose was represented with several citrus fruits. Lemon comes to mind.   Taste - The beer really had a full citrus taste. I noted notes of lemon, guava, and papaya. A sweet multi back bone accompanied the citrus notes. There was definitely a sense of balance as it was not overly sweetened by gimmicky candy and lactose. The finish was dry, though it carried a strong lemon presence.   Mouthfeel - Though there wasn’t a ton of carbonation, there was enough to break up a full body beer. It allowed the taste to linger.   Overall - I feel like this is just a step behind Heady.","  rDev Sip of Sunshine pours a slightly hazy, not quite amber color with a fair head and some decent carbonation. Nice lacing too. Smells like heaven. Slightly citrus and floral like. Taste is slightly citrus, more grapefruit taste but has less malt and more hop bitterness. Another outstanding blend. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and the lupulin is strong on the tongue. Overall a great beer that hop heads will enjoy. SoS brings out the hop bitterness to an acceptable level and it reminds me more of a West Coast style. Poured from a 16 ounce can PKG 04Mar20. A special Thanks for @jzeilinger for sharing.","  Can courtesy of yllib.  Appears a hazy copper color. Not completely Cloudy.  Nose and taste really balance the tropical and citrus fruit tastes.

Straw colored with enough lacing to remind you of the fairly thick off white head.

Slightly hazy light amber, short off-white head with decent retention and lacing  Fruit salad type of aroma with peach, apricot, lemongrass, guava, passionfruit, orange, and lime with dank, herbal note.

Beer poured a deep golden with a very nice white head that is leaving lacing behind.  Nose is fragrant with mango, pineapple, and orange.  Taste is a very nice combination of a larger pale malt base with those tropical influences of mango and pineapple. Definitely influence from orange tinged hops with a classic rind bitterness to remind you this is a double ipa! 8/10 on my bitterness scale.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and very refreshing despite the abv.  Overall definitely an excellent ipa that is worth the price of admission!","  rDev Pours a mostly clear albeit cloudy orange color. Bright and bronzed. Thin velvety white foamy head dissipates somewhat but never completely.   Bright aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, and a strong malty backbone on the aroma.   Taste follows the nose with immediate notes of orange, orange rind, pine, sap, and grapefruit giving way to a strong malty backbone with caramel notes. Strong piney bitterness starts on the back end and lingers into the finish.   Feel is medium bodied, but not too heavy. Somewhat oily, smooth and slick. Moderate yet bright carbonation. This feel is really perfect for a DIPA.   Overall, a lovely DIPA that does live up to its reputation as an outstanding example of the style.","  rDev $ 18.78 (Including tax and deposit) for four-pack of 16 oz cans ($ 0.293/oz) at Alkies, Massena, NY.

Sweet up front but enough hops to balance. Transcends styles..kind of like Arrogant Bastard did when it was new....interesting beer.","  rDev 12oz bottled 9/2/17 poured into a Duvel glass at fridge temp 10% ABV 51 IBU. The beer pours bright red hued amber with sticky light khaki head. The head never really goes away and spotty lacing is present all over the glass. The aroma is pine first with some citrus. The taste is semisweet caramel first before a rush of piney, citrusy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated, sticky but somehow dryish in the finish. Overall, great. I love this beer. A very fine example of big malt and big hop bitterness interacting in the best possible way. (Original review 10-13-17)   Subsequent review of an aged bottle that I've had in my possession for four years now. 12oz bottle coded 285 5 2 (October 12th 2015 Chicago) poured into a Lagunitas jar glass at fridge temp. Still looks great. Aroma is big with malt and pine. The taste is semisweet caramel first now with some piney, resinous hop coming through in the finish. More like an English barleywine with burnt sugar predominant. Still enjoyable, but very different from fresh. Reviewed 10-17-19","  rDev 6/21/17...pours rich sharp amber with light layer of white foam sitting on top. Some lacing. Malty brown sugar nose. Sharp medicinal taste, puckers but not in a sour way. Edgy bitter at the end. Unique no easy drinker More WTF than anything else.","  rDev Amazing orange mohgany color. Immediately the aroma let's you know this won't be a common beer drinking experience. Malt,sugar,followed by perhaps fruit and mild hops. The alcohol effected the taste a bit as it was a bit overwheming. Malt and brown sugar was forefront but there was some mild hop finish . It was a well made beer and very unique but not something I could drink a lot of. People who appreciate craft beer should definitely give this a try just to experience something different","  rDev It pours dark amber or brown with a tan head. Fairly clear. Aroma is sweet malty with some hops coming through too. With regard to the taste it is sweet with some prolonged bitterness at the end and with a surprisingly floral aftertaste. One can definitely taste the brown sugar too! Medium body. A very enjoyable beer.","  rDev This beer pours a deep clear ruby-hazel, with a large head. The aroma offers lots of sticky, piney hops, resin, cannabis, and caramel. The flavor i sweet and sticky with resinous pine, cedar, and caramel. The mouthfeel is rich and sticky with lots of carbonation. Overall this is a straightforward beer, but completely delicious. It is malt driven, but the hos also play a huge role, with all their cannabis and resin suggesting tones.","  rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into a speiglau IPA glass.  Look is a dark amber bordering on cola with a big white head.  Aroma is malty alcohol lotta biscuit to it.   Taste is a very strong hoppy barleywine. Similar to fresh Bigfoot.   Good, but I'd kinda like to see the hops integrated more thoroughly.","  rDev Pours a clear reddish brown color. Couple finger tan head dissipates laving tons of sticky lacing and a thin residual head.   Smell has aromas of brown sugar, oily floral/grassy hops, sweet malts, and touch of fruit - notes of citrus.  Taste follows the nose with a strong sweetness up front giving way to a surprisingly bitter hoppy finish. Lots of orange peel, brown sugar, caramel and pine. Pretty sweet overall. Pleasant malty base comes through   Feel has mild carbonation. Thick sticky mouthfeel thats likely from the sweetness. Dry finish.   Overall its a pretty good beer- solid old ale.","  rDev Lagunitas makes some intense brews, and this is a good example. 9.7% abv. 1.100 o.g. 51 ibu.   Dark honey/amber color. Mid sized foam cap, solid white. Decent lacing left over.  Thickly sweet malt bomb aroma. Caramel scented malt with some red fruits and tangy citrus from the hops. Smells like fruity whisky.  Freshly poured from the bottle and into a mini snifter glass, the flavor has a very intense fruity hop kick, high alcohol heat buzz and a long, caramel-sweet malt that turns, woody or cask-like. I'm imagining this stuff out of the barrel!   A massive full body, nice crisp punch that mellows to long, slick malty finish. I'm thinking of pairing this with smoked cheddar cheese at some point, if I have any of this beastie liquid left by the time I'm hungry.   With Big, strong ale's I find it important to comment on how well the flavor changes as the liquid warms. After all, you really should sip on this or you may become too drunk, too early in the night. Go slow, and let it warm up some. Usually the malt gets more complex and sweeter.   I believe this style of ale is what Kings and Vikings would drink if they came back to rule the world, or if this type of brew was around then.....although, maybe they would demand a Gold colored brew......anyway.......  As it warms, the aroma strengthens, more fruity hops, bigger , sweet, cask barrel malty tones come out.   I'm thinking of this brew to be the Mike Tyson of beer. Just F'in rugged, street smart, slightly ignorant, but demanding respect....always. It's giving me major attitude as I type this. Pretty sure it wants to take a swing.  Big in all ways, complex and honestly, the balance is just right for this style. Que to Stones song.....","  rDev Poured from bottle into tulip, monster 2 finger light tan head, recedes rather slowly, great lacing. Darkish amber in the glass, crystal clear to look at. Smells of malt, crystal, caramel some pine on the nose. This is an in your face caramel sweetness on the front end, followed up by piny citrus hops in the middle with a mild bitterness and finishes up with malt sweetness. Very thick almost syrupy mouthfeel, great mouthfeel. I like this, and don't mind having it every now and then, but this one is just a little too sweet for me to drink quite frequently. I grabbed a six pack of this last winter and never got around to rating it. I told myself I just didn't like it and didn't know if I would finish the six pack but that puppy disappeared rather quickly, so maybe subconsciously I like this more than I think.","  rDev 12oz draft pour into a short goblet boasts a red tinged amber body floating start of near white bubbles. Citrus hop aromas dominate with a grass background. Malt joins evenly in flavor for a nice balance. Mouth feel is bubbly and almost wet on the finish.  Restrained and tasty.","  rDev How on earth have I never reviewed this before?  First off, kudos to Lagunitas for releasing such a strong, wonderful seasonal so widely, and doing so while keeping the cost solidly below east coast local offerings. As much as I appreciate the efforts of the fancy-beard crew at Cumwater brewing, or whatever the local place is called, I can't justify spending 15 bucks for a four-pack of their so-so beer when I can buy this for 11 a sixer.  This pours a dark amber that's not really brown but kind of like sunstruck brown sugar. Nice heard and fierce effervescence, for a beer of its strength.  Smells like a US old ale or strong ale: lots of stuff going on, stylistically intense and messy but never getting out of hand. Aggressive, old school west coast hops against super duper intense amber malt.  Tastes like it smells: a wonderful goddamn mess. It's not bitter and then fruity, like most very hoppy American beers, nor is it at all fruity heavy. It's just bitter and then sweet. Aggressive, bright, piney hops and then aggressive, sugary, bready malt.","  rDev Hard to believe this was considered a mistake. Dark amber with Thin beige creamy head. Aroma is subdued malt and molasses. Taste comes on a bit stronger, palate aftertaste stronger still. Slight hint at alcohol warmth. Very good on a cold winter’s day.","  rDev Based on the name, I had expected a sugar bomb which I tend to prefer over a bitter hop bomb. The nose is excellent, it looks great, but the hop bitterness overpowers the brown sugar taste. Not impressed due to the bitterness, but I plan to revisit this one."]},{"Name":"Lunch","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/20681/68916/","Brewery":"Maine Beer Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.00,"Score":97.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled Dec 14, 2021 so about 10 weeks old.

Chalky, clean bitterness and silky body seals the deal. Nails the East Coast-West Coast hybrid better than anything I’ve tasted.  I get the fuss. Divine.","  rDev Appearance: Hazy gold, big head.  Smell: Nice sweetness, grapefruit.  Taste: Nice balance between sweetness and grapefruit, honeyed malt note, moderate bitterness, very tasty!  Overall: Some Maine product made it to WI/MN in 2019 or 2020 but I was always too late to pick it up. Now it appears to be all over the place in MN. This IPA lived up to my hopes, very nicely balanced IPA with classic sweetened grapefruit flavor along with a nice honey malt undertone. Yum.","  rDev Pours a semi murky golden color. There's a ton of slightly off white head - 3 finger. The head dissipates somewhat quickly, and there's a bit of lacing on the glass as it does.  The nose is somewhat tropical smelling. I get noses of mango, guava, and pineapple. Faint hint of sweetness to it.  The taste - Right away, and it lingers, I get more of a pine hop. This is replaced by the tropical. Pineapple, seems to hit first, with the mango and guava hitting later. I man not getting the faint sweetness I was smelling, but i do get a nice bitter after taste. The body is so sticky. Even a minute after a sip, I'm still feeling the hops in my throat.  This beer is well worth the hype, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to buy it.","  rDev So surprised to see this on MN store shelves. Beer is hazy but not like the hazy of the trendy IPAs today. Aroma of citrus but it is softer than WC IPAs of yesteryear. I also get subtle stone fruit and pine. Has a nice malty background. Flavor has a balanced sweetness that assists with the hop flavor. I can see where the makers of the sugary juice bombs got their inspiration but went way too far. This is just enough sweetness and anymore would be excessive. The hop flavors have a softer edge to them but all the flavor is still there. Notes of orange, tangerine, and pine. Good body with a very nice carbonation. Again here we see inspiration for beers to follow.","  rDev A beer I’ve had on my wants list since the pilgrims hit Plymouth Rock suddenly appears on shelves 20 miles from my house. 500ML worth. The humanity!  The pour is sunset over Nea Kameni: clear, gold, beautiful. The nose is much better than sulfur: bright citrus for miles. The combo almost requires shades.   Lunch is like a fossil dig: one can almost taste the inkling of the transition from old school bitter IPAs to the current sugar-filled orange juice trend. Mirroring the nose the primary explosion is bright, warm citrus with grapefruit, floral notes, with a touch of spicing &amp; a lingering finish of moderate, tongue-tingling bitterness. The rare 500ML bottle that’s in the appropriate size container.   I could swill this for hours. Lovely beer.","  rDev Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a lightly hazy, medium golden amber with a fine, two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing; looks nice. Aroma of pale malt and citrus and lightly piney hops, lemon and pine needles; lightly floral. Flavor is pale malt, citrus and piney hops, lemon, grapefruit, suggestions of mixed tropical fruit, pine needles. Finishes with a solid citrus and piney bitterness with fleeting stone and tropical fruit notes. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I've been lucky enough to try some other Maine Beer brews in the past (impressed with all), but never Lunch, which seems to be one of their best loved ales. I can see why. Advertised as a East Coast take on the West Coast style, I'm getting the nods at the western IPA in the citrus and pine, but this seems more to me to be a pale ale profile amped up to IPA levels. Like the label, it appears somewhat understated at first, but is clean and full flavored with an excellent hop bill emphasizing the West Coast citrus and pine flavors. Light mixed fruit and floral notes develop into a solid citrus and pine finish. I'm an evening drinker, but this would be an excellent IPA for lunch or any other meal. It's named for a whale, but the name is equally evocative of dining. Nicely presented and a great IPA. I'd love to try it super fresh.","  rDev Pouts a clear orange color with a medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass a bit on the way down. Smells of sweet malts and floral/earthy hops. Tastes of strong sweetly roasted malt backbone with a nice mix of earthy and then floral hops to finish it off. It hits slightly heavy, perfect carbonation, awesome old school IPA. Excellent execution.","  rDev Single bottle from Red Bank Fine Wine &amp; Spirits Hazy deep golden color with a massive foamy head, great retention. Aroma has notes of pineapple and orange. Taste is not as fruity as the nose suggests, good balance to the hops. Medium body with good carbonation. I like this one!","  rDev On tap, a 16 oz. pour. Has a golden/orange color with a 1/2inch head. Smell is of citrus, some pine. Taste is the same as the aroma, a touch of tropical fruits, significant bitterness.

Imperial Pint Glass  *4th of July Weekend 2021*  I was fortunate enough to have this beer gifted to me as a surprise. As this is my first time trying a beer from Maine Beer Company, I was eager to pour it into a glass and give it a taste  Pours a hazy orange color with a big fluffy white head that forms on top. Quintessential trails of sticky lacings cling all over the glassware  Whiffs of a fresh bouquet of flowers and chopped oranges &amp; limes  First sip is really enjoyable with obvious citrus fruit and pineapple sweetness. There's a caramel malt backbone with hints of black pepper and a touch of Juice Fruit gum. I quickly realize this is super drinkable and cherish each sip  Awesome IPA, Cheers!","  rDev Poured from a 0.5-litre bottle into a Spiegelau Adina beer goblet. Bottled on 04/27/21. Hazy, dull orange colored pour, with a fluffy two-finger long-lasting white head that left scads of pretty lacing as it receded. Well balanced on the nose and palate. Lots of bright citrus (grapefruit, orange, zest), tropical fruit, and resiny pine up front, with undertones of light malt and cracker. Sweetness is understated. The glass I used had an etched bottom, allowing a constant stream of bubbles to rise. Good carbonation, lots of orange-zest bitterness. The finish is crisp, with a little astringence and some lingering citrusy tartness on the palate. You know it's good when each sip begs for another. This is such a beer. Well done!","  rDev Review 1532 A beer dedicated to a whale, I feel honored to drink it. First beer from this brewery. A simple and understated label, yet it is refined and elegant. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a monstrous three-fingered bright white head. The airy and foamy head left a ridiculous amount of lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The color is SRM 8, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The liquid is clear with a few carbonation bubbles popping up towards the surfaces. The beer has a polished appearance.   Pine, oranges, and pineapple dominate the first detection. Nosing further, I detect crackers, toasted bread crust, mangos, guavas, and grapefruit rind. The hop profile in this beer is fragrant and juicy.   The flavors are pine resin, mangos, guavas, oranges, toasted bread crust, floral esters, a hint of herbal a touch of phenols, and subtle earthiness.   The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic and astringent,   The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a fuller finish.   This beer is a work of art. I do not care for hybrid beers where they mix both styles into the IPA. Generally, the beer is either too much pine and grapefruit and little fruitiness or vise versa. The pine and grapefruit with floral mingle well with the fruitiness of the hops notes. The malt has a firm backbone but it is not overbearing. Wow, just a stunning beer.","  rDev 16.9 oz bottled 20April21 (11 days ago!) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright honey colored amber with sticky light khaki head. The head recedes to a thin ring and puffy island. There is a complete lacing on the glass as the liquid level falls. The aroma is mild with candied citrus, peach, very mild pine and caramel malt. The taste is semisweet caramel and biscuit malt with an immediate moderate bitterness and hop flavors of tangerine, pine, grapefruit, peach, and a pinch of an earthy, pithy note. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly soft with average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. There's some definite hop oil and shellac, but it's not remotely oversweet. Overall, excellent. The sum is greater than the parts here. Masterful brewing.","  rDev Pungent hops...  Delicious balanced flavor...  I adore this offering from Maine...  This...this is what IPAs need to get back to....clean, slightly bitter, hoppy... no haze needed here..   Just a good clean solid old school IPA that has you ready for the next sip with its bitterness and refreshing flavors...  This has been around for a while so I won't do it any favors with eloquent words...  I will and do buy this every time I see it fresh...  Incredible beer.","  rDev The right thing was done and a brown bottle, slightly larger than a pint, was poured into a clear glass liter mug. There's plenty of foamy white head atop a dark amber colored brew. A whale of IPA goodness is now in the air. It's hoppy and malty. Modest glass lacing appears. The taste is fine, as hops move from there, at the beginning, to dominant at the finish. They're not just bitter, they're resinous, whilst clean and not at all sticky. Although there is maltiness by witness of the taste, this drinks too thinly to be considered among the best. The sufficient ABV is nicely intertwined into its overall taste. The taste is there, but the body isn't.","  rDev Procured a bottle of this from Crafty Draught in Mt Pleasant, SC. Bottling date was Jan 5, 2021. Today is Jan 25, 2021. Id say that's pretty fresh! Pours form the 16.9oz bottle into a tapered imperial pint glass. Emerges a perfect golden color with a little bit of haze. Not really a juicy IPA haze, just an unfiltered beer haze. Topped with a magnificent cream colored, foamy, dense head. The retention is unbelievable. Easily two fingers in size and remains a solid one finger in size for nearly ten minutes.   Lovely aroma on this one. Piney for sure. Grassy, somewhat floral. Maybe some grapefruit but not a whole lot of citrus. Earthy.   The flavor is wonderful as well. I do get some grapefruit zest in the flavor along with tons of pine needles, a bit of a floral character too.   This is a bitter one, and I love it. Clean finish with a strong hop bite that borders on astringent. I was never a fan of the juicy IPAs so Im glad to get this  old school  west coast style with an east coast attitude. An easy drinker for sure. This one goes down smooth and easy and is oh so drinkable. Lovely!","  rDev Got a 64 ounce growler from  What's On Tap  locally. Immediately poured a glass at home. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a fair head and a delicious aroma. Taste is smooth and has absolutely no bitterness. Lightly malty, a hint of citrus and orange on the tongue, an outstanding balance in this IPA. The feel again is smooth. Total enjoyment. Overall I am thrilled to find this beer in Texas and get this opportunity to sample Maine Beer Company's Lunch. 22Jan2021 Update. Got a bottle dated 16Feb21. Special Thanks to @tasterschoice62 LarryB for sharing. Outstanding in the bottle too.","  rDev Thanks to Roguer for this one, from a recent LIF box. 16.9oz bottle (dated 8/11/20) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a hazy, almost cloudy, dark orange color with 1-1/2 inches of white that had good retention and light-moderate lacing.  The aroma was hop-forward as expected, with some gentle grains as a foundation. The hops were mostly citrus, with some floral touches.  Similar on the tongue, but much brighter. The hops popped across the tongue nicely, and a lingering bitterness on the finish lets one know that this is no child's IPA.  The body was solidly medium, crisp, carried great carbonation throughout the glass, and had a dry finish.  Drinkability was excellent, these would certainly be a regular for me if local.

Smells very fragrant, fresh ripe fruity hops - tangerine, grapefruit, guava, lemon, passion fruit. Also malt, creamy vanilla, bread, weaker floral and herbal hops. Taste follows the nose, nice bitter hit of hops at the finish which was well balanced with the sweeter malt backbone. Excellent balance and depth, good complexity and flavors. Couldn’t taste the slightly higher ABV. Smooth sticky mouthfeel that was actually a little soft, good retention of carbonation. Really an excellent IPA and one others should aspire to emulate.","  rDev Bottle from Lúpulo. About 1.5 months old.  Golden deep copper to amber. Fluffy head for days. Slight haze. Yeast at bottom.  Floral and honey hop smell.  Floral and herbal dominate taste. Malty sweetness. A little citrus and pine notes.  Fairly thick mouthfeel for an ipa.  Overall a very different ipa experience than I’ve had for a while. A time warp to before west coast ipas and far before neipas.  Reminds me a lot of zombie dust by 3Floyds. The caramel sweetness and hip balance well balanced.","  rDev This pours with just the slightest bit of haze. I get a nice nose of pineapple juice and some citrus on the back end.

The malt here reminds me of an amber in the way that it feels toasted  The taste starts with bittersweet dark chocolate, but there's not much else going on. It treads the line between sweet and roasty on the swallow, but the chocolate feels very authentic. A touch of grassy hops in the aftertaste  A medium body pairs with very light carbonation to lead to a fluffy and refreshing stout. Drying in the finish which clears the palate for the next sip  This is an extremely drinkable beer, almost dangerous. I would not frequently get this, but I could absolutely pound a few of these if I'm in the right move. Simple, but very good","  rDev Nitro can. Thick creamy beige tan head. Dark brown color.   Cocoa powder and chocolate. Creamy, silky chocolate. Lightly roasted malts. Hershey’s syrup and chocolate milk.   Smooth and creamy. Light to medium bodied. Solid.","  rDev Nitro can. Deep black opaque appearance topped with a tan, thick, creamy head as expected with a nitro gizmo. Great looking nitro cascade with the pour. The head lasts nearly until the end, leaving strings, spots, and sheets of tan lacing as you drink.  Aroma is chocolate with earthy hops. Semi-sweet malt aroma. Roasted coffee.  Feel is the silky smooth nitro presentation with a thin body.  Taste is dry with chocolate. Some roasted malts. I'd describe it as an Irish Dry Stout with chocolate flavor added. Quite nice, desert rather than dessert. The finish has a slight bitterness, and as at the beginning, dry.  Listed as a sweet/milk stout, but it is not sweet at all. It is a good, but not great, chocolate-flavored dry nitro stout.","  rDev From notes 10/1/12: This review is based on the bottled version, not the nitro can. Pours a deep brown (looks black) and produces 1.5 fingers of mocha, short-lived, tightly bubbled head that leaves thin strings of lacing. Nose is dark roasted/burnt malts, semisweet chocolate, a hint of coffee and weak dark fruit. Taste is semisweet chocolate, creamed coffee, light smoke and char. Slightly bitter quality following mid-sip, subdued it increases in the almost watery finish and lingers into the bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied than expected (almost thin) with low carbonation it is smooth, creamy and goes down easy. I think the thin finish and mouthfeel is typical of English style milk stouts.","  rDev 14.9oz widget can stamped BBD 13Jan20 PD 13/01/2019 (10 months old) poured into a nonic pint glass at fridge temp 5.2% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with creamy khaki head. The head settles to a solid half inch cap. The aroma is faint with chocolate and roast malt. The taste is muted bittersweet chocolate first with some coffee, dark roasted malt and slight tang. The finish is mostly dry and mildly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with typical nitro feel. Overall, good. Nitro beers are not my favorite, but this one is pleasant enough. I would like to try it fresher or on draught, if given the opportunity.","  rDev A- Pours a very dark color with a slight head and lacing A- Aroma has coffee and cocoa hints M-The taste follows the nose with a coffee and cocoa flavor M-A light bodied moderately carbonated beer O-A nice Stout","  rDev Had this beer a *very* long time ago and bought it again recently so I could review it on here. While not up to par with other Stouts that I've had as of late, this is a classic that almost felt like a Porter because of how easygoing it was and how dry and roasted the mouthfeel felt. If that's your kind of beer, then you have a big-time winner with this one!  Poured this out of an 330 ml / 11.2 oz bottle as the head filled up the remaining space in my pint glass. That was quite tan, full and bubbly as the liquid below it was like root beer while being just a bit thinner. Lots of lacing left behind, especially near the bottom of my pint glass. Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and bittersweet chocolate in the nose as all of these came through in the taste. Once this warmed up, it was quite nice and smooth on the palate while being drier than I recall, as this needed a bit of water to get everything down. A bit more lactose and sweetness would have been nice but this beer was just fine as it was since there was enough carbonation to keep this light and me on my toes...  Not a lot of booze here and the mouthfeel was somewhat cloying as the roasted undertone and slight stickiness lingered long after this went down. No date after the  best before  on the back of the label but this tasted fine as there wasn't any sediment in the liquid whatsoever. British in feel, this Stout's a must-have for anyone looking to indulge in the classics and see what a Breakfast Stout with chocolate and extra coffee would come across as!","  rDev On tap at McGillicuddy's","  rDev L- To the eye it's black, poured carefully into a pint glass and it still yields a 3Cm mid-tan fine head (holds very well). S- Toasty, plus hints of cocoa. T- Wow, unmistakable strong fragrant cocoa on the front, evolving into a smokey bitter chocolate finish. Well supported by balancing malty richness. F- Rich and bitter vying but in balance.  O- Dark and broody, quite full-on considering it's 5.2%. To me this would go well in winter sitting by an open fire, but fans of black beers (stout/porter etc) might enjoy this one year-round. Intriguing beer, you get pinged around from cocoa to rich &gt; bitter &gt; smokey, and meanwhile nothing I note out of place. Dull it ain't! 500ml bottle, BB: 31/1/2020","  rDev Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty malts. It carries a light bitterness to the aroma, but it fades away as the beer warms a touch. Flavor profile is milk chocolate, cocoa nibs and caramel layered over roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty, caramely malts. It carries a distinct and notable bitterness, with the chocolate working to sooth that a touch. It becomes more balanced as the beer warms. Mouth feel is lightly creamy, with a medium-thin consistency. At warmer temperatures, the consistency thins out a touch with a more still texture as opposed to creamy. Overall, chocolate notes are pleasant with a light-bodied dark beer underneath.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16.9oz bottle.","  rDev Had this Double Chocolate Stout at The Tap, Bloomington, Indiana, on draft into tulip pint.  A classically slow-starting English stout, until the perfectly weighted “double chocolate” arrives, creating a beautifully sessionable stout experience.","  rDev Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very, very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a one finger, ultra fine, light brown head with great retention and nice lacing. This was a can with a widget inside and the head is an excellent simulation of a nitro pour. Aroma of dark toasted and biscuit malt, milk chocolate; a hint of vanilla and coffee. Flavor follows, with slightly sweet, dark toasted malt, milk chocolate, a little vanilla and more roast and a slight coffee component in the finish. Luxuriously creamy medium body with great mouth feel. One of the classic chocolate stouts and deservedly so. A little lighter in flavor than I expected, but everything is mellow and well integrated. The chocolate is authentic tasting, but somewhat understated and the finish is a little drier than the initial taste. The creamy body enhances the balanced flavors and I would buy this widget can over any other format for that reason. Very pleasant and satisfying. Another beer that I've had many, many times, but never reviewed for some reason.","  rDev L - Black as night, as it should be, but with some translucent porter qualities on the fringe in a glass...proper. S - This is where the bulk of the chocolate hides, on the nose, especially when still chilled. Heavenly T - As it warms, those aromas of chocolate turn more oyster stout-like, and it does occasionally... F - lose a little CO2 carbonation as it warms, and seems watery by the end of the near-pint serving but still delicate. O - One of the classics, even if it is often overshadowed by other  showy  higher alcohol stouts these days.","  rDev Widget can pour pour yields a 1/2 inch creamy, creamy, creamy, tan head over a dark brown body with gorgeous, sticky lacing. Nose of chocolate and some coffee. Taste mirrors nose with flavors of a light and sweet coffee. Nice feel and overall, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet as I've been enjoying it for years. Cheers!","  rDev Poured from a 330ml bottle into glass. Stamped on bottle neck is best by date of '20/02/18'. Dark brown body with brown highlights when presented to light. Bubbly two finger light tan colored head settles to bubbly cap. Good area coverage of spotty lacing. There is a dark fruit component to both the aroma and the taste, which is quite comparable in expression to the different senses. Aroma also has dark malts and chocolate. Taste expresses a solid dark malt base, and lighter additions of chocolate and coffee. Sweetness on the light side. Thin to medium mouth feel. Very easy drinking. Not exactly dry but quick to clear the palate. Solid stout with chocolate that can be paired with many foods. Clean, and induces repeated sips.","  rDev Decided to revisit this one after several years, and it's much better than I remember. A rather aggressive pour into a nonic pint glass yielded a ton of thick, soapy tan foam atop an almost ebony-colored body. Scads of sticky lacing as the head settled into a thick cap. This has a very nice roasty malt character, with lots of chocolate flavor as expected. There are also notes of tart fruit and dark roast coffee coming through as the beer warms toward room temperature. Medium light in body, not too sweet. Surprisingly dry finish, with a little lingering roasted coffee-bean bitterness. This is light enough, dry enough, and low enough in ABV to make it a great pairing with all kinds of food. Not overpowering, very drinkable. Although a little on the spendy side, it's worth an occasional splurge. Widely available in the U.S.","  rDev First things first...how did I get almost 1300 beers into BA without having tried this classic? Shame on me.   Pours a pitch black color with a nice thumb and a half of root beer head. Retention is excellent and there is some fantastic lacing. The smell is sweet fudgy chocolate, malty goodness and some vanilla. The taste follows the nose fairly closely with the chocolate being dominant. Feel is much thinner than expected, not a bad thing just not expected, and the carbonation is fine.  A good sweet stout. Would pair nice with some cookies or a plain donut at dessert. A classic, and now I understand why.","  rDev Black in color with a malt chocolate aroma. Welll balanced and flavorabke beer that delivers chocolate without making it overpowering or artificial tasting. Only complaint was that it appears thick and creamy it felt and tasted a bit thin","  rDev Decanted from 440 ml/14.9 fl oz nitro can into a conical pint glass. Pours a dark brown to black with typical pattern of clearing with a solid and lasting 1/2 inch head. Nose: bitter chocolate, toffee, banana; palate: remarkably dry with nice balance of dark roasted malts and dark chocolate, with anise notes. Medium bodied with full, creamy mouthfeel. Really a impressive drinking experience.","  rDev Poured from a nitro can into a glass.  Brown/black liquid.   Dark khaki nitro head; a curtain of lace.   Roasted coffee &amp; milk chocolate nose; a wonder!   Silky medium mouthfeel.   Smooth milk chocolate delight. Hint of roasted coffee. A true anytime beer; good for breakfast or the end of the night.","  rDev Very dark brown look to it, has that oily edge. This might say  double  in the title, but I believe that is in regard to the amount of chocolate or chocolate malt going on here, not the abv or overall strength of the beer itself. Now that is out of the way, lets talk about the aroma, no the head, good 3/4  tan small bubbled head. An aroma evocative of chocolate malt for sure. A little bit of barley behind that.  Taste, wow, the lactose in this and chocolate malt make for a very chocolate forward beer without the use of any actual chocolate. Right? This doesn't actually have the adjunct chocolate? Its chocolate malt and lactose, and they work well. You never have the roasty edge in this one, that's why I said oily and stuff. Pretty sessionable. I think this is a good stout to give people who don't like the overly bitter and heavily roasty or syrupy ones.","  rDev On tap.  Pours a beautiful dark brown almost black color with a thick frothy off-white head.   Tons of chocolate aromas up front. Undertones of roasted malt and lactose. The aromas are not as robust as I'd like to see.   Taste followed the nose with a ton of chocolate flavor up front, both milk chocolate and powered cocoa. A balanced backbone of roasted malts, mild hoppy bitterness and sweet lactose are also present.   Feel was thick and velvety with some mild carbonation.   Overall a really fine example of a chocolate milk stout. One of the better ones out there.","  rDev Young’s Double Chocolate Stout Brewed by Wells &amp; Young's Ltd with an ABV of 5.20% This Stout pours out a deep brown color with a nice off white head. The head on this stout is nice and thick. This brew puts you in the mind set of cola , not saying that is a bad thing. The smell of Young’s Double Chocolate Stout is rich with roasted grains , malts and hops. There is also a nice amount of sweetness in the smell of this brew. More than likely from the chocolate. Now for the taste it is bold with flavors. You first pick up the smoothness of roasted grains ,malts. Then there is a nice sweetness smoothness at the end of this brew. There is alot going on in Young's Double Chocolate Stout. This brew has a real super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. The mouthfeel of Young's Double Chocolate Stout, is rich, bold, clean, and smooth. This is one of the better Milk /Sweet Stout on the market. I really like this brew. Overall I'm giving Young's Double Chocolate Stout a 4.75 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Wells &amp; Young's Ltd, did an great job with this one.

It's been a loooong time since I've had one of these, but I'm surprised to find that this is actually a little skunky, making it somewhat reminiscent of a Heine. There's also a lightly bready, corny quality within the medium body's firm froth, which finishes semi-dry.   I'm not sure how or why beer like this ever gained such wide appeal, aside from being the only option for humans for entire generations, but that must have created a lingering nostalgia for skatolic qualities within us. Poor suckers, we are.","  rDev It was the skunk in the aroma and taste which was by far the most dominant factor that made this unenjoyable. The malt,grain, and earthy hops were okay in the aroma as well as the taste and the body was fine. But the skunkiness was a total buzz kill for me.","  rDev Revisited October 25th, 2021 (from a can)  Very nice pale gold colored body, crystal clear; excellent carbonationl thick, white head, dense and frothy, sticky rings and patches of foam cling to the glass. Warm, cereal grain aroma; toasted malt. The taste accentuates the smell; toasted grains with a delicate sweetness, almost honey-like; very mild hop bitterness presence. Medium to heavy mouthfeel; soft and velvety on the palate; semi-dry throughout.  I'm guessing, based on the can dating on the bottom, that this is a freshly canned edition of the beer. It is fabulous. Well-rounded smell and flavors, beautiful look and stupendous mouthfeel. There is certainly no 'skunkiness' this time.

I didn't get much hop presence. It is close to what I would consider a  skunked  beer.  I drank this one straight from the bottle, so I'll have to scare up either a draft pour or another bottle poured into a drinking glass to revisit this one.","  rDev Rating from 2002:  Among commercial pilseners from giant breweries, this is one of the best. Very drinkable.  Well, my beer preferences have developed considerably since then, but I am still able to down a Stella as a thirstquencher now and then.","  rDev 19.2oz can stamped 12/10/21 poured into a signature Stella Artois chalice at fridge temp 5% ABV. The beer brilliantly bright golden yellow with nearly white head. The head builds quickly then recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. Slight lacing. The aroma is faint with barley malt and yeast. The taste is also subdued with pils type malt sweetness up front and a slightly metallic, slightly watery, skunk and floral hop finish. That all probably sounds bad, but it's not. It all mostly works. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, good. I have to say this is better cold, so if you go for the 19.2, you need to be quick about it. This can was brewed in Belgium BTW, not sure how much longer that will be the case.","  rDev So, from this a Beer Empire that conquered the world. Poured into a clear glass pint mug, it shows itself as a translucent, bright and light amber. It has that European smell that's close to skunkiness, but it's not. Although there's not much head, it's well carbonated and leaves a little lacing. Breadlike sweet, lightly smooth, a bit yeasty and a nice pilsner hop finish runs the taste from front to back. Not outstanding in any way, but better than mass produced commercial beers.","  rDev Poured from fridge temp. Pours a nice clear yellow with quickly dissipating white head. Nose is grass, wheat, orange peel, and maybe a bit of hops. The taste is mild. Light fruitiness with wheat and grass. Some bread. A slight sweetness on the aftertaste. Overall, a really nice light drinkable beer.","  rDev Pours a clear golden straw with a finger of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is biscuity, bready, nutty malts with a little bready yeast. Flavor profile is nutty, biscuity and bready malts with a little wafery, crackery malt and herbal hops.

Nice beer","  rDev (1 pint, 6.4 oz green glass bottle; best by 01.2020... split-poured between a fluted goblet and a teku)  L: brilliantly-polished, crystal-clear pale gold liquid; nice voluminous stand of white foam on pour, collapses to a thin cap, but laces like a champ  S: brief puff of skunk gives way to toasty pils malt, flowery-grassy hop, and an apple-y sweetish lightly phenolic ester; hint of cardboard too?  T: dry apple pie? - esters and underlying lightly-baked doughy malt give that initial impression... mild herbal bitterness and vaguely bubblegum phenol linger long through the finish... a bit more balanced than its competitors, not as 'bottom-heavy' in the malt; relatively dry at any rate  F: very much pillow-soft in its flow; light-bodied but frayed static on the edges... faint sense of spicy warmth pervades  O: I always thought Stella was decent for its kind, with a touch more spicy-herbal bite to it compared to its contemporaries... this bottle wasn't it at its best (artifacts of skunk), but was still refreshing and tasty enough after I was out in the heat earlier (1401)","  rDev Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) green bottle into a Stange glass; best by 11/02/20. A: Pours a crystal clear, yellow color with a robust, foamy, white head formation, moderately good retention, and solid Belgian lacing. S: Aromas of grasses and grains, especially sweet corn.

O: A very well made, eminently drinkable European Pale Lager. Subtle sweetness really helps.","  rDev I’ve had this beer quite a few times when I was younger, years ago, and now sampling it again I was pleasantly surprised by its flavor and crispness. Tried it again on tap at a local restaurant. Pours a nice golden color with some fluffy white head and fades within a minute, leaving some surprisingly nice spotty lingering lacing. Barely a hint of any aroma - maybe a trace of grain and floral hops. Tastes much better than it smells - crisp malt, grain, corn, a little apple sweetness along with the faintest hint of floral hops. Sweetness definitely dominates any bitterness here. Smooth crisp thin mouthfeel, good carbonation. Would drink again if necessary, and if other craft beers weren’t available.","  rDev Have I really never rated this beer before, wow!, I must have drunk it 1,000s of times over 3 decades. L- Darker straw, pours with thin white head that swiftly clears to lacing. S- Indistinct, good or bad, I honesly get zero from this. Unusual! T- That of industrial mediocrity I suspect. Little distinguishable into a dry hoppy finish. M- Dry, watery, that's it. Perhaps the alcohol makes some presence known on the tongue right at the end.  O- This beer is just so blah. Not actively bad nor offensive, just nothingy especially compared to fashionable modern brews that seem to be packed with hops/fruits/etc flavours. This would be an easy inoffensive inexpensive session beer, maybe that's the intention. - Bought in a 568ml/UK-pint can from Tesco, London. From past experience I know that you can find Belgian brewed Stella in London, often in smaller off-licenses where [cough cough] the stock has come over from the continent as duty free or similar. The point being, the Belgian brew is FAR better and more interesting that this UK brewed version.","  rDev Stella is not a bad beer. I have enjoyed it many times. Tonight, it was the only beer worth having at a bar in country club where a dance party was held.  It was poured from tap into a tall pilsner glass. The beer does look good and it has a good head and leave nice lacing. The smell is crisp and a bit grassy. The taste is also crisp and nicely dry. Overall, this is a beer I plan to enjoy again in the future.","  rDev Yeah, so I had to get this with dinner due to the lack of any other conceivable craft option. They didn't even have Firestone 805 and this is California! Essentially, light straw yellow body, quarter finger white head, fair retention and no lacing. Smell is honestly not much compared to any other beer. Light toasted grain, a bit of mineral and that's it. Very bland lager on the palate, with a light body and a watery finish. I really wanted to enjoy this, but I decided I'd rather drink a cold glass of water over this.","  rDev Well, a friend brought a case to a cookout, so why not. I haven't had Stella since I lived in England over a decade ago. It looks passing fair, translucent and bubbly , the color of dehydration. Smells acceptable but heavily corn- or rice-influenced, and a bit light-touched despite coming straight from a cardboard case. But the taste. Not the worst beer I've had, but it's enough to make me question this friend. I hope it makes a better drain cleaner than beer.","  rDev I've had much worse, but this beer doesn't really stand out even for the style. It pours a pale straw color with a fluffy head that sticks around for a while. Honestly the appearance is perfect. The aroma is faint skunkiness and light crackers malts without a whole lot of any kind of happiness. The flavor is crisp and clean. It starts out with a light sweetness and a slight bitterness. The only thing that ruins it is the skunkiness. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, exactly what you'd expect. Overall, I like American adjunct lagers better than this. It just isn't worth trying to me.","  rDev On tap.  A - Pale yellow to straw yellow colored pour with thin dense white lacing.

I've had many of these over the years and it's not a bad beer for an occasional revisit.","  rDev Thin like William Powelll in a leading role, this one is not off to a promising start. Feel is like Myrna Loy in a corset; again, thin like. But the taste, you know what, like a Fatty Arbuckle feature, it’s not all that bad. Light grains, light malts...  Ok!","  rDev Consumed 1/20/18  A: Golden yellow - crystal clear - pours with a medium sized white head, fades to a wispy cap, retains a small collar and leaves some lacing  S: Overwhelming skunk after pouring, but gradually the stank fades - some light malts - some light malty sweetness, like breakfast cereal or corn - light hints of grassy hops - some more lightly sweet malt lingers  T: Light malty sweetness - as the aroma suggests, it has some pale malt flavor, but it also has an odd sweetness to it that is tastes too light to be residual sugar, and seems oddly reminiscent of corn - slight hint of grass presumably from the hops, and a mild, lightly earthy bitterness - an undercurrent of sour as well, which I do not think was intentional  M: Light body, crisp, medium carbonation, finishes mostly clean  O: Can't you hear me yell-a? You're puttin' me through Hell-a? Stella, STELLA!!!!   I probably tried Stella about 9-10 years ago, and I haven't revisited it since. And now I remember. This is a fresh bottle that I am pretty sure has been in constant refrigeration and has not seen sunlight. Yet this was skunk city after pouring it. Ignoring the skunk, it's just a very light, nearly tasteless pale lager.","  rDev Poured from bottle to Pilsner glass. Pale yellow color, crystal clear, with nice carbonation and a few fingers of soapy white head. As expected of a green-bottle beer, there's a cooked veggie aroma with cracker and grassy notes. Flavor is corn, sweet, crackery, and herbal/grassy. I was surprised at the amount of flavor Stella has. You can do a helluva lot worse than a Stella.","  rDev 330 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 6/4/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Bit of skunky notes in the aromas that dissipated as it sat in the glass. Okay aromas of pale malt and minimal hop notes; with poor strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread, lightly toasted biscuit, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread, lightly toasted biscuit, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Lightly increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery feeling. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a solid pale lager. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Nicely flavorful and clean pils malt/grain presence with decent hop balance. An enjoyable offering."]},{"Name":"#9","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/96/299/","Brewery":"Magic Hat Brewing Company","Style":"Fruit and Field Beer","Alcohol":5.10,"Score":78.0,"Comments":["  rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass.

If Harpoon is a Camel, this is vaping.","  rDev With pulled pork sandwich for lunch, on tap at the New American Cafe in Boston... medium amber with a finger of tan foam... had a moderately fruity and earthy character... smooth and easy-drinking... cafe called it a pale ale but it was darker, maltier, and less hoppy than most I've had; not sure why the site categorizes it as a fruit/vegetable ale, but then again, I'm not sure if it is brewed with any additives... Decent enough, but not to my usual tastes...","  rDev I drank this one right out of the bottle at a picnic. The color was a golden amber. I couldn't tell about the head and lacing. The nose was intriguing: malty, with apricot and interesting spices. The first thing I tasted was apricot and bready malt with some sweet vanilla or caramel. It's medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. You don't even notice the 5.1% ABV. Honestly, I expected a little more from Magic Hat. It was okay to drink with burgers and hot dogs but I wouldn't seek it out.","  rDev Ordered at The Quarry in Tuchakoe, NY. Poured golden to light copper color with a 3/4 inch head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving significant lacing. Nose: just a hint of apricot/pear; palate: like a lager, but again with fruity notes, especially on the back end of swallowing. Light body and mouthfeel. Refreshing, if not very complex. Probably good for the beach.","  rDev From the bottle at Firebird Tavern, Detroit, Michigan on 02/17/17.","  rDev Pours a light amber color with a white head that goes away quickly. Has a somewhat fruity smell going for it. Taste has a sugary sweet potato to it, very odd","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a one finger white head. Aroma of citrus, slightly floral, and a bit of Belgian funk. Taste is sweet, citrus, honey. Light to medium body.","  rDev Poured into a pint glass at 41 degrees. Appearance is a medium amber color with orange and reddish hues. The clarity of the is clear with some carbonation bubbles. The head is white frothy, and one finger thick.   N: A fruity nose with stone fruit, toasted malt, lemon, floral, and perfume and yeast.   T: fruity with stone fruit, toasted malt, lemons, floral, perfume, yeast, and a pharmaceutical note.   M: A creamy note, carbonated, and finish a little short.   O: This is an average fruit beer, I would have like to tasted more fruitiness.","  rDev Billed as an unusual, mysterious beer in 1995, it might have been worthy of a time capsule as representative of how the second generation of craft brewers were pushing the envelope by adding fruit to enhance refreshment.  To its credit, #9 does pose a mystery: it is apricot fruity throughout, yet gets dry at the end... albeit not a pleasant one.  Rather than never have #9 again, I tried again with a pineapple salsa. It gives the ale more purpose, but not redemption.  #9 was on the  1001  list printed in 2010. Brewing has progressed greatly in six years. If #9 deserved to be on the list then, it is improbable to be on the list today.","  rDev Pours a clear yellow with a white head. Good amount of lacing. Peach and citrus in the aroma. The taste is a mix of sweet malts and peach, with a little bit of a bitter sting at the end. Mouth feel is good. Not exceptional, but good. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer. It's certainly easily available to try.   Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev L: Copper gold color with a very creamy head and nice lacing on glass.  S: A lot of peach and apricot, some citrus  T: Malty, peach with a slight ending bitterness.  F: Light body, pretty Crisp and clean.","  rDev I don't know, tastes unlike a fruit added lager or pale ale, maybe more like a blonde, but some kind of nondescript fruit sweetness that doesn't make me want more.","  rDev Golden with active carbonation. 1/2 inch white head that fades quickly to a thin ring with light lacing that quickly slides down the glass. Nice hoppy/fruity/citrus aroma with a hint of sweetness. Reasonable mouth feel for the pale ale style. Odd malt or fruit initial taste that transitions to a sweet aricot with a very slight bitterness with the fruit sweetness lingering on the tongue. This beer is interesting, at least, and hardly ordinary. It is enjoyable enough to finish the 6-pack over a few days, but not enjoyable enough that I will buy it again. Even though it is easy drinking at first, it begins to wear out its welcome; I couldn't have more than 2 at a sitting.","  rDev Starts out with a not appalling copper color and half inch of head. Then you get a weird aroma like the bargain bin fruit at the grocery store that has already started bruising and rotting.   I don't even know how to say that this didn't taste like beer, tasted like ax body spray for women. I can't take anything away taste or mouthfeel wise that resembles a beer. This is not a beer I want to revisit at any price. How in the hell do these guys have the distro they do?","  rDev ** 01/02/2012 On Tap at Dub Linh Square.  ar: Citrus.  lk:Gold pour  ta: A bit fruity, but mostly smooth barley Pilsner flavor . fe:Smooth drinking beer, great with Pizza.

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of apricot, peach, plum, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of apricot, bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of apricot, peach, plum, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, peach, plum, honey, toasted biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness, complexity, and balance of apricot, bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavor; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5.1%. Overall this is a very good fruited English pale ale style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of apricot, bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth, clean, and easy to drink. The aromas were stronger on the apricot notes, but still had a good amount in the flavor; and the base English pale ale is very well done for the style. A very enjoyable offering.","  rDev This beer gets hated on wayyy more than it should.  Look : A dark apple cider color, with 60% opacity. The head is 3 fingers tall, popcorn yellow, and leaves giant fluffy lace as it recedes to a finger.   Smell : Apples, pears, a slight sour berry note, and some grains behind that. No hop presence. Nice, fruity, floral.  Taste : A little washed out with pale malts and hints of pear, banana, and sliced apple. A nice oaty cereal grain finish as well. Lingering notes of marshmallow, peaches w/ cottage cheese. I think it's delicious.  Feel : Super easy to drink, light bodied and refreshing. Crisp all the way to the bank.   Overall : I'd buy more of this. I liked it, others hate it...the only way to know is to try it for yourself.","  rDev Pours a clear amber with a small head. Lightly fruity smell followed by a pleasant taste. Creamy mouthfeel with very little bitterness. Intriguing and enjoyable."]},{"Name":"Furious","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13014/28203/","Brewery":"Surly Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":6.70,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Canned in October. No doubt the hops have shifted in their representation. Still an impressive hop forward IPA that pays homage to the left coast but establishes its on identity.   Huge head, tons of lace. Lots of pine and citrus What's really lovely is the Scottish malt base.   Nice amount of pine and citrus hits the nose with significant force. Good amount of biscuity malt.  Solid malt front is quickly subsumed by the huge hop component. Pine starts with a big and firm citrus follow through. Super clean and dry finish with a surprising amount of malt. Light hop oil.  Feel is solid and easy drinking. Solid carbonation and quenching swallow.   This reminds me a bit of the early West Coast IPAs like Pizza Port et al. Bigger and heavier malt backbone give it a distinctive personality. Hops are huge and all over this beer. A nice bookend to the other great midwest/heartland American IPA, Bells Two Hearted. Great overall brew. British malt, American hopping. Wonderful beer.","  rDev From a can dated 07/14/2020 and sampled much later on March 26, 2021.  Handsome looking amber-bronze pour with a notable, puffy off-white head.   The hops may be a bit stale at this point but I am still getting pine and fruit elements on the nose as well as a decent caramel malt backbone.  The mouthfeel is medium.  The taste is at first sweet and then the pine bitterness presents itself as it moves along. Moderate bitterness at the end. Despite the age of this can, it is clearly a balanced traditional IPA...the kind of IPA that you do not see as much as the juice bombs that are out there.","  rDev Pours a dark nutty amber with a hint of fog to it. Head is two fingers of khaki foam that forms a luxurious pillow across the top of the beer. Aroma is biting hops, hitting notes of resiny, dank, pine, herbal hops. Storyline is really all hops, with an aggressive bite up front. Flavor profile is resiny, dank, herbal, medicinal, and pine hops with a bready malt backbone. Malts do a little to quell the initial swell of hops, but the hops drive this beer from the start. It has less hop bite in the flavor profile than the nose, striking a better balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a constant and consistent bubbly effervescence throughout. It straddles the line between crisp and refreshing and bold and sippable, encouraging the drinker to consume in either fashion. Overall, hop bite reminiscent of old school IPAs, this is one of those IPAs that gave them the reputation of being  overly hoppy . Despite that reputation, this beer retains a good balance within the style, offering up abundant hops in a punchy, aggressive beer.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can.","  rDev a: dark copper color with some nice amber and cherry wood notes. large, 3 finger fizzy light tan head  s: orange, orange zest, grapefruit, and a substantial hit of malt sweetness. pineapple, tangerine, and candied apricot. a little strawberry and mango. a nice crackery touch at the end as well  t: sweet grapefruit, followed by a nice grapefruit bitterness. orange zest, orange juice, and sweet mango. nice sweet caramel sweetness to balance the bitter. sweet strawberries, and a touch of resin. at the end there is a nice mild floral hop note that is really nice, and a crackery finish  m: medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation  o: simply put, this is just an awesome old school IPA. hoppy, bitter, and a nice malt punch. i can't find anything to fault in this","  rDev Amber with chill haze, clears as it warms, generous light khaki head, awesome retention and lace Grapefruit, orange, mango, passionfruit, and pine aromas Tastes like it smells with caramel malt backbone, nice bitter finish Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation This is the best IPA I've had in a long time. Sorta like NE aromas on a WC framework","  rDev A: Dark glassy and dirty orange pour has a light tan foamy head that is dense and frumpy atop at two plus fingers. Tons of quick paced effervesce makes its way throughout. An intrigue showing of web lacing adores the vessel walls from the slowly eroding head structure. Great looks per style and lasts long.   S: Dark crystal malts are sweet and toasty on the nose, overlaying sticky pine hop resins. Some dank grapefruit-grassiness hops of moderate strength give this an earthy citrus and old west coast feel.   T: Dark crystal malts add sweetness to the flavor along with the raisiny character and buttery toast. Tons of sticky pine-grassy hops shows its strength with a dry and bitter flavor, old west coast style. Dry grapefruit peel and citrus provide a high rate of dry hopping and bitterness. Citronella adds some lemony touches along with a warming of flowery alcohol fueled leave of pine-cypress and toasted malt.  M: Nice fullness, warming toasted malt character, raisiny warmth of grains and alcohol with sticky pine hop resins. Good texture of carbonation.   O: The dry hopped flavor is furious and unrelenting, old west coast hopping, dank and sticky hop resins, toasted specialty malt backing with an old school delivery. Huge dry bittering flavor.","  rDev 16oz. canned on 08/26/20  Pours lightly hazy amber red orange with a dense creamy lasting off-white foam head.

Tastes like grapefruit pith, citrus melange, subtle melon, rich mildly smoky amber toasty bready caramel malts, slight graham cracker, a hint of dark berry fruit, herbal tea leaf, and fresh bitter earthy floral pine. Feels medium bodied, creamy slick with smooth moderate carbonation. Overall a really nice IPA.","  rDev Feels like it's been a while sin E I've had a red IPA like this one. Amber liquid capped with finger of foam. Nice warm malt aromas along with sharp citrus and pine. Aggressively bitter pine and grapefruit flavors roll along a wave of sweet slightly toasty malt. My can was a slight bit past where I usually would purchase, but still packed a nice punch.","  rDev my first review of brewer, glad I finally found it at WFM which has greatly improved its beer selection in 07701.  a) Perfect masuculine hazed dark amber body, supporting eggshell thick, lasting and lacing head.  s) Big, plentiful, hop over scottish malt.  t) Lots of balance with the scots malt, that smoky, woody, peaty, earthy bread feel against the pine, floral, citrus rind, and pepper hop overcast.  f) Plenty of mouth weight and tickle. o) Deserves its high ranking on BA. Sum greater than parts esp in densely flavored masculine beer akin to Arrogant Bastard in a 6.8% package.","  rDev Pours a hazy copperish amber color with a pretty decent sized khaki head. Leaves some gross  lovestains  around the glass as it settles into a ring.  The aroma is surprisingly malt-forward; like caramel bread. Does that exist? It does now. There's some faint grapefruit and orange but the caramel notes dominate. I wish caramel would dominate me. Anyway.  The citrus notes come out of the closet in the flavor: Grapefruit and fresh tangerines with a hint of orange zest. The caramel is very much present and adds a solidly sweet note between the citrusy beginning and earthy, dank, piney finish.  Feel is medium in body with crisp carbonation. Lingering bitterness, like an old war veteran. Nicely crushable.  Overall, I like it. It's a well made West Coast (or Midwest) style IPA. A 4-pack was $12.75 so yeah I'd buy this again.","  rDev This is one of those  constantly loved by everyone on BA but I just assumed it would always be impossible for me to get  beers, an illustrious subset of brews including those by Bell's, Old Nation, Weldwerks, Aslin, etc. Somehow, the stars aligned, though, which led to a local Craft Beer Cellar location getting in a fairly-sizable drop of both Furious and Todd the Axe Man. Though I'm not a big fan of the latter (have reviewed it before and was, honestly, quite let down), this is just awesome and I'm extremely excited to finally have it in my glass!  Alright, so, I've obviously heard a lot about this beer. And right away I will say I prefer the old can art with the amusing Surly logo on it, but what're you gonna do? This is a beautiful beer, though, anyway. It's actually more of a  red IPA  by modern standards, anyway, with a medium-dark amber color topped off with a fluffy, voluminous head that leaves behind some soapy, indeterminate lacing. The retention here is excellent and the surface coverage is nearly-unparalleled in its density. The body of the beer is clear as can be, which gives the deep color an even more satisfying look to it.  The nose here is an old-school assault of floral, pine-y, sweet caramel, toffee, and intense citrus aspects, all vying for space and, unsurprisingly, being treated with a good amount of respect. I get a touch of earthy onion upfront, which is appreciable and works well with the dankness that runs as an undercurrent. Already reminding me of a smaller version of the original Oskar Blues G'Knight, which is one of my all-time favorite  sticky  darker-red IPAs. It's more caramel-like than Nugget Nectar as well, in my opinion, but there's even more tangerine and orange rind with a touch of grapefruit here to balance the malt.  First sips are clean and crisp, with a somewhat-sweet-leaning malty overtone melding with bitter citrus peel and earthy, floral notes coming out in the mid-palate. More bitterness in the finish, working well with the sweet Scottish malt to really coat the palate. Speaking of that, the feel here is just awesome! It's drinkable and complex at once, and, even though it's less than 7%, it has the flavor of a bigger beer. This is absolutely worth the hype, and the price was even fantastic ($12.75 a four pack of 16 oz cans, canned ten days ago... what the hell!?). This is definitely a new go-to if it finds its way around my area with greater frequency. Can't believe it's taken me this long to drink but it was worth the wait, indubitably!","  rDev Wow, old school. More bitter citrus rind than pine in the nose, more pine than citrus on the tongue unfortunately. While I appreciate this for what it is, it has also given me renewed appreciation for what IPAs have become in this country.","  rDev Had Furious poured from 12-oz. can, bottom stamped “CANNED ON 07/02/19,” into tulip pint.  Surly doesn’t know what to call it, so I will call it a Red American IPA. A little light on the malt for the color and all the hops, but an excellent beer that should be shelved between SN Celebration and Flipside.","  rDev I had wanted to try this for years and was psyched to see it the other day at State Line in Elkton. Poured it this evening for my brother and sister in from California. I was shocked at how drinkable this was. Small bubbled and tight throughout, this is understated, and delicious. The hop flavor is herbal and pine, but not withering. I can't wait to ry this again.","  rDev 12 oz can pours a slightly dark amber color, nice head and lacing, citrus flower aroma. Medium bodied and very drinkable! Great everyday IPA! Glad this is available in Missouri.","  rDev Pours a reddish copper color with a finger of head.

Smell: Pine and citrus. A bit of caramel sweetness with a swirl.   Taste: Definite aspect of grapefruit at the start and finish. Some malt sweetness in the middle to counter the hops, but it's mild and just barely there. A bit of pine at the finish. Nicely hoppy but not overpowering.   Mouthfeel: Smooth, light carbonation, very sticky on the teeth.   Overall / Drinkability: A good hoppy AIPA. Easily drinkable by itself but 1 16oz can is enough per evening - the strong hops do start to dominate my palate after awhile.","  rDev 16 ounce can in a stemmed tulip glass. Canned exactly one month ago from today.   Pours a pretty caramel amber color. A 3F tall mass of dirty white powder drifts above the liquid and settles nicely in to a dollop and leaves a fair amount of lacing.  Uber fresh hop aromas: citrus, pine, fresh grass on a summer morn in the Jersey Pines.  Dense pine hop flavor. caramel malt, light brown sugar. Underlying stone fruit and a touch of citrus.  Medium body, creamy smooth and resinous. Active lingering hops - bitterness, flavor, snap. A touch of malt sweets. Delightful.  Upon popping the top, the aroma filled the arena.

An old-school American IPA/imperial amber ale; grapefruity and pithy upfront, loads of sweet caramelly and toasty malt, with a bit of pine and a pop of bitterness on the back end that lingers, balancing pretty evenly with the lingering sweetness of the malt.

There's a nice amount of pine coming through. More caramel and toffee really coming through. Sharp moderate bitterness. Malts are there but surprisingly don't dominate. Finishes dry. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's sharp, fluffy, slightly creamy, smooth and easy to drink.   This is my first time having Furious or any Surly beer for that matter. I have to say I was personally expecting more from this one based on the hype and praise I've seen and heard for this beer over the years. The craftsmanship is definitely on point though. It's clean, crisp, sharp and refreshing. This one definitely comes off as a  Red IPA . It's not bad at all.","  rDev 16oz tallboy can purchased at Community Pint in Spokane, WA, for $3.99. Surly is apparently doing a limited test drop of sorts in Washington, as both this and Todd have popped up in the region. Canned on July 22, 2019 per the stamp on the bottom of the can.  Poured into a nonic pint glass, this was an  autumnal  looking shade of amber, with a thick, creamy off-white head. Said head left lots of lace.  Somewhat muted aromas of piney  C  hops and caramelly, biscuity malts on the nose.  Drinks like an old school hoppy amber ale. Piney hops up front, with a big, bready malt backbone that then assumes center stage. A resiny hop zap vies with the malts to be the star of the finish.  Medium-full body, with a somewhat oily, resiny mouthfeel.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was a little surprised at just how Old School this turned out to be. I'd always assumed this was closer to a straight-up IPA, so it's amber/red maltiness was a shock. I'm not the greatest fan of such beers unless they carry a hoppy bite, and this delivers on that score. I'd drink this again.","  rDev Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium deep coppery amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus, piney and mildly dank hops, tangerine and lemon. Flavor is pale malt with a hint of caramel, citrus and lightly piney hops, grapefruit, lemon, mild mixed stone fruit. Finishes with semi-dry, citrus rind hop bitterness. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A citrus forward IPA with suggestions of pine and a long, lingering finish. The malt flavor was not as intense nor caramel as the aroma, but supported the hops well.

Pours a brilliantly clear light gold, nice head of foam, lacing.   Smells of mild pine, orange, toasted malt, some fruity sweet notes.   Tastes kinda sweet, mild hoppy bitterness from pine and grapefruit, fruity, mellow.   Medium body with medium carbonation.   Good but not something I would put on my regular rotation.","  rDev L- Dark amber, slow rising CO2. Pours with 5-7mm off-white heard. S- A touch of citrus and fruits, quite mild T- Not simply a yet another mega OTT hop-bomb, hoorah! Yes there is citrus, but there are softer fruits in there too F- The 5.90% gives it enough [rich] body to counter the hoppy dryness. I'm concluding that this has done an unsually good job of balancing prominent hops, against an appropriately meaty body. O- So many of the new beers I buy to taste/trial in London these days are tests of palette versus hops. This could be another but unusually it brings enough body to just about balance it. Unusually for this past week or two (and perhaps 20 different beers) I'm enjoying this one and would buy it again. Actually, note to self, maybe I should remember that if a beer markets itself as hops-forward, then I'll likely enjoy it increasingly more if it'sover 5%+ and higher and pref towards 6%. And ditto increasingly less below say 4.5%. and lower","  rDev Clear amber/ orange color. Around a medium body as well as average carbonation. Aroma is weak, malt, grain/ cereal, citrus and a bit floral. Taste is better than aroma hints at but still not overwhelming. Malt and grain are forward but there is a mild bitter hop, citrus taste.

Nice golden color with some head and just a little lingering lacing. Smells faintly of citrus hops and malt. Tastes of citrus hops with only just a little bitterness, balanced nicely by caramel, biscuit and a sweeter malt backbone. Thin mouthfeel with some nice mild carbonation. Definitely a sessionable beer and will have to try others from this brewery.","  rDev From notes 4/15/12: Pours a nice deep gold producing a super, 3 fingers+ of soap bubble, lasting, off-white head which leaves thick clumpy lacing. Aroma is light caramel, grass, pine and citurs and raw sugar cane. Taste is grass and citrus up front with a resinous pine finish and only a little caramel sweetness. The aftertaste is nicely bitter.","  rDev The best beer offered at Yankee Stadium. Therfore, the best beer ever. Poured from a 16 once can into a plastic cup while watching homerun derby against the sox makes the malts and the hops mingle to form the perfect balance.","  rDev Clear golden orange with three fingers of white five minute head. Plentiful lace. Smell floral resin malt. Taste is floral bitter hops with a strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium. The finish is dry and bitter but not too much so.

Light scent of hops in the nose. Light taste of hops with the malt! Easy drinking beer!","  rDev From Saveur Biere. In Teku glass. Playing Extreme Forklifting 2. Plenty caramelly sweetness with some mineral notes and adequate hops to compensate.Refreshing,clean and light,with lingering industrial feel","  rDev Pours a clear, deep golden color with a well retained half inch head that left lots of lacing. Smell is rather muted with citrus, honey and malt elements. Tastes of orange, honey, caramel, bready malts and a hint of mango. Very dry mouth feel, moderate carbonation, quite bitter.","  rDev REVIEW FROM SUMMER OF 2017  Tried multiple tallboy cans of this beer at Fenway and once at home, glad it was iced cold as when it warmed up it was not drinkable at all. This used to be one of those classic IPAs that you could depend on at all times, now it is a hollow shell of its former self. Malt backbone is pretty weak and the forced hop oil flavor doesn't impress. This is what happens when you take a well brewed brand and run it through the ringer, more marketing with sacrificing what the beer truly intended to be. Sad to see this beer in the state it is in.  REVIEW FROM JUNE 1st 2002  4.42/5 rDev +16.6% look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5  Presentation: 12 oz brown twist off long neck bottle with a “Best When Consumed By” date on the back label.  Appearance: Great lacing effect down the glass with a faintly hazed amber colour, the haze is most likely from the large amount of hops this brew has in it.  Smell: Big sweet hop oil aroma, very flowery with a mildly pungent rind. A touch of malt and alcohol in the nose also.  Taste: Medium body with a moderate carbonation that adds some crispness. Flat out there is a lot of hop flavour going on, lots of fresh hop to narrow it down a bit. Bitterness from the hops in not overwhelming but it makes its mark. Again lots of fresh hop flavours, flavours that would come from dryhopping or the use of a hop back. Maltiness is solid enough and leaves a modest dry malt character that gives a quick flash of lightly toasted malt in the mild. Alcohol is present with a clean estery flavour. The finish is long, dry and certainly hoppy.  Notes: Damn good IPA to be had here, clean on the tongue with lots of hop flavour rather than going overboard with bitterness which rests at a substantial 65 IBUs.","  rDev Really nice IPA. English style ? I'm not quite sure, it's really west coast style. Really pine and grapefruit forward. Nice balance and bitterness. Quite enjoyable","  rDev Goose IPA brewed by Goose Island Beer Co., with an ABV of 5.90% This English IPA pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a decent amount of lacing to this IPA, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich​ with hop bitterness mixed with earthly grains and malts. There is also a slight sweetness in the smell of this IPA. Goose IPA , has the look and smell of most IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness and a nice sweetness. Then you pick up on the earthy grains and malts at the end. There is a lot going on in this English IPA. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down, really hard to pick up on the 5.90% ABV in this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a real super nice balance to it. The body of Goose IPA is a soild medium. This brew would nice with lunch or dinner. The mouth feel of this IPA is Bold, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. I would look this brew up again givin the chance to. Goose Island Beer Co., did a real nice job with this brew. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up, one of the more smoother IPA's I have had."]},{"Name":"Samuel Adams Summer Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35/103/","Brewery":"Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams)","Style":"Wheat Beer - American Pale","Alcohol":5.30,"Score":76.0,"Comments":["  rDev Poured from a bottle into a wheat glass  Pours medium-gold and only slightly chill-hazed.

Smell is starts quite pleasant with wheat, biscuit, light spice, it seems to soften and sweeten with warmth.   Taste does play well as a pale wheat ale - flavor is light wheat and biscuit, with some light spiciness (not from yeast). Flavor does sweeten some as it warms; hops are neutral and just in the background.   Mouthfeel is full on the tongue but moderately carbonated - wheat presence is notable; finish is crisp and lightly drying.  Overall a good full bodied american wheat ale, a little sweet in aroma and flavor as it warms.","  rDev This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is 1, finger, white and frothy. Minimal lacing, and the retention is good.  The nose is minimal. There's a slight orange aroma, and a slight sweetness to it. Taste is fairly light like the nose. Slight orange flavor from the hops. Slight sweetness from the malt. Body is light, and somewhat watery.  Easy drinking summer beer.","  rDev Cloudy dark yellow color.

Enjoyable,could probably serve it to non craft beer drinkers and they would enjoy it","  rDev I don’t usually drink wheat beers - this one was very light and crisp but probably much more subtle than other beers in this style. Nice golden hazy color with some foamy white head. Very mild lingering lacing. Smells faintly of sweet citrus and malt. Tastes faintly of citrus fruit - mainly orange and lemon - as well as malt, biscuit and bread. The wheat flavor is very muted. Clean crisp finish with nice carbonation but a little thin on the mouthfeel. I will have to try other wheat beers and see how they compare.","  rDev Enjoyed this one from the bottle, but I'm guessing it's a very hazy yellow-brown color?  Aroma include wheat, stale citrus, stale hops and some wet white bread.  Very light taste: a little lemon, a very, very light touch of smoked pepper, and some wheat. More citrus and bread than any sweetness or bitterness here.  Between light and medium bodied feel, with strong carbonation.  It is summery and perfectly drinkable, but I'd prefer a Boston Lager.","  rDev The left side of the label says  FOR BREWERY-FRESH TASTE, ENJOY BEFORE MONTH NOTCHED  with a mark over  AUG   Appearance: The beer is hazy with a nice gold color. It has a thick, large, white head that has a smooth creamy surface.  Aroma: There is a lemon zest scent that is pretty soft but noticeable.  Taste: It opens with a slightly tart character which has a bit of an orange peel in tea flavor. There is a very light touch of wheat and lemon in the aftertaste. There isn't a lot of flavor to this beer. I found that I would drink more of the beer just to see if I was missing something. It doesn't taste bad but it just feels very average.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a nice light body with a smooth drinkable texture. Smoothness is the key point here.  Overall: While the beer does sport a pretty good aroma and flavor, it feels very  ho-hum  in that nothing tastes or smells especially fresh or well made. It is a wheat beer but it barely has any wheat flavor. There's just enough of this citrus lemon and orange peel character to let you know that something in the beer exists, but the beer is very much a wallflower.","  rDev Haven't had this beer in well over 10 years but it was included in this year's American Summer Pack so of course, I had to finally review this. It was interesting to give this a go after having so many better beers in recent years but thankfully, the  lemon pledge  taste and mouthfeel was conspicuously absent from this beer.  This was poured out into a Sam Adams glass that had the bulb shape that they designed - with the intent that it would hold the head and aroma in longer while bringing out the carbonation better. Indeed, the foam was tall in this and the golden hue was pleasing for a summer beer without seeming watered-down or weak. Lots of lemon, grains of paradise, and wheat in the understated nose but thankfully, they were more present in the taste. Full bodied and not terribly tart, this was an easygoing beer with hints of lemon pepper, white bread, and pumpkin-like spice and aftertaste. It kept things light but relatively dull, even after the last sip went down.  Like any good summer beer, this was light in alcohol and nearly was a session brew when all was said and done. Not close to being the best seasonal from Boston Beer Company, this offering with a November notch on the label was not as bad as I remembered it. It just needed a bit more kick and flavor to it to stand above the proverbial seasonal pack. Worth a go once for a taste above the typical lawnmower beer.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; best by Oct 2017.  A: Pours a hazy, dark golden color with a half inch head with low retention and lacing.  S: Aromas of cloves, toast and pepper initially with a more sour citrus smell later.  T: Dry with cracker taste; acidity leads to a crisp refreshing finish. Light bitterness in balance.  M: Surprisingly full bodied with solid effervescence well into the pour.  O: I have had many  summer ales  too many of which are truly subpar. Some adulterate with too much lemon or fruit or try too hard to be  fun.  Perhaps something like a Belgian wit with characteristics of a sour ale, this is a refreshing, subtly citrusy and drinkable. Would do well on a hot beach day.","  rDev Pours a hazy medium yellow color with a one and a half inch fluffy white head that left blotches of lacing. Smells of wheat and lemon. Taste follows the nose with a pepper finish. Well carbonated, light bodied, clean and crisp. Refreshing on a hot day.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb Nov 2017 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 5.3% ABV 7 IBU. The beer pours a hazy honey color that turns straw colored in the light. The head is off white and fairly thick settling to a 1/4  cap. It leaves some lacing behind and finally recedes to a skim coat. Aroma is lemon and wheat malt, distinct but not heavy. Taste is wheat malt followed by a lemon taste and then the grains of paradise. No perceived bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied and prickly on the tongue. It's not heavily carbonated but the adjuncts must give the beer it's bite. Overall, ok. I wouldn't classify this as an American Pale Wheat Ale but that's just me. Very inoffensive to non craft folks which is why it was in my fridge in the first place.","  rDev 12 oz bottle  clear yellow in color, foamy white head. aroma is a bit grassy, lemon, herbal. taste is mild and thin, sort of sweet. thin bodied, intended for easy drinking.","  rDev Pours a gold color with a minimal head that disappears quickly.

Far too thick and syrupy.","  rDev 16oz draft pour into a mug. Hazy dirty orange colored body floating minimal, and disappearing, white head. Aroma has some lemon peel and wheat. Flavor matches with a little something extra. Grains of paradise, huh? Ok, sure. Now I know. Light feel with moderate carbonation and a lemon dry finish without astringency. This is not going to assault anyone's pallate. Very refreshing.","  rDev Poured from a 355ml bottle. Hazy, orange/yellow with visible carbonation but only a thin smear of head. Light, lemon washing-up liquid smell. Light, lemony taste with just a hint of wheat. Almost medium bodied with a reasonable level of carbonation. Otherwise, very little mouthfeel to speak of. Resolutely bland. With just a hint of something not quite right.","  rDev Pours a turbid hazy golden. Citrus aroma. I've seen dramatic difference in batches year to year. 2016's seems to have less of that band aid character and is heavy on the lemon peel. The wheat shines a little more and it more tastes like a beer with citrus peel than it does a citrus beer, if that makes sense. The base shines more. Overall, it's a refreshing summer beer, but with questionable consistency bottle to bottle."]},{"Name":"RuinTen Triple IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/82250/","Brewery":"Stone Brewing","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":10.80,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled in a big brown glass bomber a delivered right to my door by cat in the glass Pours a carob coloured body with nice thick white head  Aroma is big big pine Citrus caramel flavour","  rDev Had this one on tap, after the Stone Enjoy By 31-10-15, at Ernie´s Tin Bar, Petaluma - and I was about ready for anything.

A sizable bubbly soapy lather of a head caps the top, its white color accentuated by a tan hue. It retains well and leaves plenty of sudsy lacing. The aroma, modest at first, is not necessarily a harbinger of things to come. Lots of caramel at first. There is the slightest bit of pine and cooking herbs and spices. Fruity yet not as citrusy as other IPAs; light grapefruit, however, there is a stronger emphasis on dried apricot, fig, and peach. The aroma opens up more well into the drink and on the malty side. For example, a biscuity malt makes its presence felt. Finally, wonderful sweet aroma of warm and freshly baked blueberry muffins caps things off.  In the mouth it is a complex combination of plump and juicy fruitiness, smooth and velvety malts that coat the mouth like a soft pillow, and a moderate to high pine hops prickle. Medium to full bodied, even chewy, yet dangerously drinkable. Feels like a hoppy barley wine at times. The carbonation is gentle. The fruity tones consist of apricot and moderate grapefruit and citrus twang on the backend. Sweet finish with a strong herbal, resiny and bitter linger.

Drank on a tasting that had so far Founders Backwoods Bastard, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard and Brooklyn American Ale. Note, this beer was bottled on November 2015, totally NOT FRESH.  A: The appearance is bit hazy with a yellow-y and orange body with a white head that vanishes quickly but leaves nice lacing.  S: The aroma is a perfect round shape of malt, pine and citrus together, all in the same strength. Very good tone to it. T: This taste is one of the most wonderful things I've ever had even though the beer is to be TOTALLY NOT FRESH. On the start of the sip, you can taste the sweetness of the malt that when you start bringing the beer back to the throat starts to be a bit more bitter to each half of inch it crawls on mouth. In the end, it ends a bit bitter with a touch of citrus and hops, while the citrus profile is present in the sweetness, in the transformation, and in the end. It's totally great, amazing, incredible. M: The mouthfeel is great, the bitterness is high but nothing harsh, nothing like a kick, more like a friendly touch. The density is great as well. O: Best. Stone. Beer. Ever.","  rDev On tap at the Office in Summit. I was rather disappointed by this brew. The alcohol was not well-masked at all, in fact, it was cloying and overwhelming, and distracted from the overall flavor of the brew. Pours an amber hue with minimal frothing. Strong pine flavors evident. Not recommended.","  rDev Bottled on 6/8/2016. Poured into IPA glass. It pours a pretty, hazy orange-amber color with one finger of milk-white head and lacing. The tiny bubbles ascend the glass throughout the pour. It smells of sweet malt, pine needles, grapefruit, orange, peach and other sweet, tropical fruit,and resinous hops. What a taste! It has a solid malt base with a touch of caramel, followed by a combination of sweet fruit and citrus, and a nice hoppy finish. I'm actually surprised it isn't more bitter and biting. All of the flavors blend seamlessly to produce a great taste experience. You can also really notice the alcohol. If there were ever a  chewy  IPA, then this would be it. It's rich and creamy and the 10.8% ABV packs a punch. Overall, this is an outstanding Triple IPA, definitely meriting its lofty rating. It drinks like a Barleywine. It could easily be savored with a good meal or for after dinner. Just great!","  rDev 22oz. bottled on 06/16/16  Pours clear rusty dark orange with a creamy off white foam head.

The bitterness lingers on in this copper colored, crystal clear beer. This is a big, in your face Imperial IPA that works.","  rDev From the neck of the bottle:  Bottled on 06/16/16   Appearance: The body is not hazy but it has this opalescence that makes it hard to see through. It is a dark shade of bronze and I can only see shadows through it. The head Is very thick with a creamy texture and white in appearance. The head stays up for a very long time and it has very good lacing.  Aroma: There is a big pine aroma that is very welcoming to the nose. There is also a bit of a tangerine quality to the aroma which is nice. It has this resinous aroma as well.  Taste: Up front I get this sweet malty character with caramel and a bit of sweet honey that is quickly washed with a bitter pine resin flavor. There is a touch of alcohol flavor which is understandable for a 10.8%ABV beer but it doesn't hurt the flavor at all. It just lingers in the background a bit.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation with a good raw bitterness and a medium body. The beer drinks thick and it has a lot of texture to it. The finish lingers for quite a while.  Overall: I enjoyed the beer. I don't think it would be a beer that I would regularly purchase but it is one that i would revisit every once and a while. The overall character is a classic pine flavored bitter West Coast style (triple) IPA but it hearkens back to the older styles that had a lot more malt presence. I am really enjoying this bottle so I would recommend it. Pairing it with food would require something big and flavorful so the flavor of the food is not lost under the wingspan of this beer.","  rDev Bomber.

Medium-bodied.","  rDev I finally decided to try this behemoth of a beer. A Triple IPA was just insane. Got the beer on tap in a tulip style glass. The beer poured dark mahogany color with reddish tints. The head is off white with good retention. The head left a sizable amount of lacing on the glass. The beer is near opaque and has some carbonation bubbles.   The nose is strong grapefruit, pine, floral, grass, perfume, caramel, toasted malt, bread yeast and booze.   The taste is pine, floral, lemons, grapefruit, oranges, floral, grass perfume caramel, bready, biscuits, booze, and yeast.   The mouthfeel of the beer is bitter, carbonated, crisp, slightly chewy, and the finish lingers.   The onslaught of hops is mind boggling. The hops is strong but not overwhelming. The malt backbone is very firm and hold up to the hops assault. This is one monster of a beer, very good, very well made, and very tasty. I really enjoyed it.","  rDev Been following the evolution of RuinTen for a few years now, so, when I popped into my local Craft Beer Cellar (Westford, MA) and encountered two of my favorite store associates engaging in discussion about the beer (whether it should change ABV each year to reflect the year, whether it should follow current IPA trends and become hazier/use different hops/etc.), I had to grab a bottle to see how I felt. I know that this was originally made to be a  bigger version of Ruination  and I am also aware that Ruination itself underwent a renaissance to a slightly-newer-school version last year, but I wanted to weigh in personally about this beer.  Pours a gorgeous deep amber color with an everlasting ring of off-white head that sits consistently and succinctly in my glass. Lace is ephemeral, seeming to return to the beer from which it came each time the glass is swirled, but I don't really mind when the base beer is this beautiful. Perfectly clear, and with such nice retention and head buildup... can't fault it too much here at all.  Nose is floral and pine resin with some light candied citrus, pineapple and caramel malt backing those elements up. Slight sniff of perfume-y ethanol in there underneath the other notes, though less than expected for a  triple IPA  (I hate this terminology, for the record). Slight baking spice and grapefruit peel. Honestly, this is a weirdly underwhelming beer in the nose. It presents some semi-unique but anonymous scents that seem to have very little relevance to each other.  On the tongue I get a much better coagulation of the disparate elements from the nose, with deep caramel malt leading before being almost instantly subsumed by hop acrobatics. Pine, grapefruit, orange marmalade, peppery spice, rose florals and bready malts combine to deliver a very impressive flavor profile.  Full-bodied with a generous carbonation and slight sweetness in the finish to balance the intense bitterness, RuinTen definitely delivers on multiple fronts. It isn't my favorite beer by Stone, but it doesn't mess around and delivers pretty much precisely what it sets out to: a frontal hop-assault with very little distraction on the way. My CBC friends may disagree, but I believe Stone should keep things the way they are with this beer. The ABV is a bit much for my taste, but it is sensible if taken in the context of being a celebratory, once-a-year brew and the combination of Magnum for bittering with Centennial and Citra hops in the dry-hop is a winning combo that delivers citric, floral and piney elements in spades. Good stuff, at a solid price.","  rDev Bottle dated 6/25/15 into pint glass. Pours a murky amber with a solid eggshell-white head. Initial impression is, of course, hops. Grapefruit, resinous, big citrus hops. But there is a nice maltiness that almost balances things. Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Slightly bitter finish. Really good DIPA.","  rDev Huge dehydrated orange appearance, off white head, over 1/2 . Big pungent hops, brings it hard. Amalgamation of those hop aromas you all know about, interplay is well to where not one of them takes the front seat, they all share.  Taste was massively bitter, but substantial malt bill on it provides adequate support. Its not just simply massive, it actually imparts flavor and is enjoyable to drink.   Sometimes you just gotta go super hard, this beer is for those times.","  rDev Pours an opaque deep gold/pale amber producing 1.5 inches of creamy, frothy, somewhat lasting, off-white head that leaves motes, strings &amp; streaks of clumpy lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, packed with tropical fruit, melon, earthy spice &amp; a hint of citrus. Taste is sweet caramel malt, loosely balanced with high octane hoppiness: tropical fruit flavors predominate with a little citrus, earth &amp; spice with a very wet finish &amp; alcohol spice. Aftertaste is an oily hop/malt bitter-sweetness that rapidly gravitates to an imperial bitter. High ABV is detectable but subdued. If dank can be substituted for earthy then this beer certainly qualifies as a dank brew. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, oily, wet &amp; slick finish with a bitter &amp; astringent aftertaste.","  rDev 200ml at Brewdog DogHouse, Glasgow (£4.40): Another excellent Stone IPA with tonnes of bitterness balanced against sweet malts &amp; sticky caramel flavours. A complex beer with a nice array of hop flavours &amp; bitterness coming through on top of a full body that was easy to drink despite the strong alcohol content.","  rDev Appearance – A bottom glass pour produces an incredibly cloudy body of dark orange copper with reurgitated hop flakes floating about unseen. The head is crazy on an aggressive pour. It’s full, pure white, lacing, and lasts forever.  Smell – The deep pine hop profile finds some strong biscuity bread at the nose and an explosive aroma of darkish fruits such as dates and raisins. Once the beer opens up the fruits are increibly powerful but not overly sugary and the yeast develops.  Taste – This is incredible. It’s my first use of the term “bready hops” but man the biscuit and yeast are in full effect and the huge comlex hop profile is incredibly diverse. It’s not a heavy PNC hammer but more like a sophisticated CA profile of citrusy rind, light peach, grapefruit peel, and pear.  Mouthfeel – This is full-bodied wth a lot of drying from stem to stern.  Drinkability – 10% plus? Are you sure? Drank this like water.","  rDev Pours a very cloudy amber color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is great. Has a nice fresh citrus aroma with some piney resin. Not as much of a boozy aroma as I would think. Has a nice smooth caramel taste with slight citrus and piney resin at the end. Nice and hoppy. Malts and hops blend very well. Moderate to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. It hides the alcohol content very well until the very end, when you get a slight alcohol burn in your gut.","  rDev Extraordinary IPA for those who love big time SoCal hops with a adequately matching big time malt backbone. Everything is so full and well balanced. Smooth in flavor and beautifully smooth on delivery. It's like a great session sipper on Atlas rocket fuel.  To the moon Alice!!! So rare to have such a big beer so pleasant to sip and enjoy. Wow! Great job Stone.","  rDev I really liked this big hop  mosh pit  as the bottle describes. Dark golden color with a little bit of head and lacing after pouring from a bomber. Smell is a big hop slap to the nose that we all love of course. Taste is as you would expect: sweet, citrus, even a nice almost rye spice to it. But it doesn't overwhelm which is what I like most about this. Not too big even as a TIPA. Finishes sweet and mouthwatering, doesn't linger on the tongue too long and from beginning to end is a pleasant experience. Worth getting and taking a couple down if you can find them.","  rDev 650 ml bomber served cold-ish into a pint glass. Purchased while in the US a little while back. Bottled on June 12, 2015.  Appearance - hazy, rich dark golden and honey brown colored. A finger of fluffy white head with impressive retention. Plenty of visible carbonation in the beer. Impressive and imposing DIPA, that pours thick and gives the impression of a massive beer.  Smell - citrus dominated with mango, pineapple and kiwi upon repeated whiffs. Some caramel in a subdued malt backbone.  Taste- big bold sweet citrus flavours, some pineapple and kiwi with a roasty malt undertone. Reminds me of an amped up even stronger Ruination. Huge dose of bitter hops lies right beneath the surface but only makes it's presence felt briefly mid-sip, before caramel and butterscotch round the beer out. Alcohol is there but doesn't taste like a beer nearing 11% ABV. Alcohol content starts to rear its head once the beer warms.  Mouthfeel - massive body! thick and syrupy on the palate with a heavier dose of carbonation that is subtly very good.  Overall - very delicious DIPA, with a huge hidden hops bill and a nice combination of tropical fruits and sweet malts. Very yummy yet I was expecting something with even more hops intensity, especially on the palate. Still a great sipper."]},{"Name":"White","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/4/59/","Brewery":"Allagash Brewing Company","Style":"Wheat Beer - Witbier","Alcohol":5.20,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev 16oz can.

The beer pours a bright clear golden color, almost champagne like, and sits in the glass with a slight haziness to it. A bleached white head of 2.5 cm foams up and fades slowly to a sturdy surface layer. This foam sticks around through the sampling and gives off some scattered lattice when I take a sip or swirl the glass. Aroma is light with some bready yeast, light lemon notes, a bit of sweeter orange and some mild coriander. Not really any hop notes nor ABV. Another mild but interesting nose. First sip reveals a light body with crisp texture and fine tingly carbonation that rolls across my palate. Everything about this beer points to high drinkability. Flavor is similar to the nose with some bready notes and a bit of wheat twanginess. This moves to lemon and orange citrus and finishes with some spiciness. Beer dries out on the finish and leaves me wanting to take another sip. Pretty crushable brew, mild but good balance. Some citrusy or coriander burps as I finish off the beer. good wit beer.","  rDev Damn near perfect witbier. Light, wheaty citrus, mild spice, blessedly light on the clove. Some many are heavy handed with the clove. THE best lawnmower beer in the land.","  rDev Drinking this at my Local Harris Teeter Grocery Store Pub. Poured from a tap into a pint glass. Looks hazy golden yellow with a very nice foamy head that dropped to a thick cap and a lot of lacing. Smells lightly bready, citrusy, grapefruit, yeasty, floral. Taste follows the nose nicely with citrus on the front of the palate. Mouth feel is light and refreshing with plenty of carbonation. Overall one of the best Witbiers I've had I think because of the Belgian yeast and citrus notes. I would definitely order again. Cheers!","  rDev Pours the slightly hazy and the color of ginger ale with a finger of head. The nose has a mild dose of funky Belgian yeast. The flavor has a wheat backbone with a little lemon and a little orange. The body is more hefty than I expected.","  rDev I had this beer for the first time at a hotel bar in Boston some years ago and thought it was one of the best beers I had had. I was surprised I had not reviewed it earlier but managed to get a 12 pack of cans over Christmas.  The canned stuff not as good as the draft I recall from years ago but it is an excellent beer. Pours a bright yellow color with excellent head and curtain lacing. Nice fruity smell and taste. Lemon, orange and coriander. Glad I got a 12 pack. 4.5 overall for old times sake!","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  PACKAGED 10-07-20 09:31:6771   Appearance: The beer is a very pale dry straw color, almost to the point of being grey. It is very hazy. The head is very large, fluffy, and white. The surface texture of the head consists of pillows of clouds. Excellent head retention.   Aroma: There is a light lemon peel aroma.  Taste: Up front there is a tangerine flavor mixed with pepper. Towards the middle of the mouth there is a bit of papaya flavor. The aftertaste has a bit of bubblegum character and a slightly bitter herb note that is nondescript.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is good and it is easy to drink. It feels light-bodied and wet.  Overall: The can states that this is a  Beer with Coriander &amp; Curaçao Orange Peel.  The Coriander character is missing from the beer, as is any wheat flavor. The yeast character is minimal. The orange peel flavor is outstanding. The beer as a whole is decent and I could drink it from time to time, but there are better ones on the market with more flavor and aroma.","  rDev Poured from a can - opaque lemon yellow with short white head leaving minimal lacing. Nose is soft citrus ,clove and yeast. Taste follows with a touch more citrus , clean and crisp on the finish. Excellent witbier.","  rDev Can from lupulo.  ~ 4 months old.  Look: light yellow, slight haze. Fluffy wheaty head that stays forever. +lace.  Smell: Classic banana, clove, bready. Faint pine.  Taste: Pretty much the same. Faintly grassy finish.  Mouthfeel: pretty slick, medium.  Overall: very solid for the witbier Belgian style. Definitely Belgian-esque.","  rDev This beer is very pale straw in color, almost beige! Very hazy but not quite opaque. Translucent. Capped with a creamy white head. Excellent retention.  The aroma is very bright, spicy and herbal coriander--with a lemony tartness and a boatload of sharp, twangy raw wheat.  The aroma is bright and tangy raw wheat and cracker malt, cracker/white bread and lemony tartness, with a prominent zingy coriander spice. Some underripe banana, vanilla, orange zest, and clove follow. Clean, crisp, and dry.   Medium-light mouthfeel. Light but not watery. Well carbonated, slightly pillowy.  An excellent witbier--maybe the best American witbier. So refreshing.","  rDev Very tasty Belgian wheat beer - have always been meaning to try this brewery’s offerings and finally found this one online. 1/13/20 date printed on can. Pours a slightly cloudy orange-yellow color with lots of fluffy white head after a vigorous pour, some small soapy rings of lingering lacing. Smells of nice Belgian yeast, grain, malt, vanilla, caramel, bread, much weaker banana and clove. Tastes similarly, great balance and flavor, very enjoyable. Smooth mild mouthfeel, slightly sticky, good carbonation. Not my usual style but I can see why this one is so highly lauded. Well done!","  rDev 12oz bottled 1-6-20.

Early spotty lacing and more throughout the drink. Yeast, soft spice and floral nose. Orange / orange blossom. Faint banana yeast character. Wheat. Flavor follows the nose, great balance of spice (coriander and the bright lemon notes that come from it), fruit, yeast with a slightly chalky feel and wheat malt.

Clove, banana &amp; faint orange citrus flavors up front; mild burnt caramel &amp; a nice carbonation bite on the finish.   A real nice brew!","  rDev Pours a lovely hazy pale yellow with only finger of quickly dissipating white head  Smells strongly of wheat, maybe a little citrusy and even a bit spicy  The taste is better than the aroma, which is good because I've been wanting to try this classic for a long time. The full wheat flavor is balanced by a not so subtle spiciness, really interesting and not the citrus flavor I was expecting, though that comes in play at the end  Full bodied and a little  sticky  for lack of a better word, but still goes down smooth  Overall this was not what I was expecting, but quite pleasant nonetheless","  rDev 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip   A- A hazy golden straw with a small white head.

O- A great example of a witbier, easy to drink and very well balanced.","  rDev Poured from a tab into a wit glass.  Pours exceptionally light, pale-gold, with some milky haze, but not cloudy. A fine pillowy head. An excellent looking wit.  Aromas rather citrus-forward, with hallmark esters present but somewhat masked. Lemon, orange zest, and faint banana/clove.  The flavor is somewhat subdued and simple, but that is no criticism. Initial estery sweetness and wheat are followed by creamy lemony sourness and a nice dry conclusion.  The brew is very light and well-carbonated. Excellent representation of the style in that regard.  Overall, one of my favorite wits, and certainly my favorite American one.","  rDev Pours a glowing and cloudy deep straw with 2 fingers of white, moderately lived, tightly foamed head that leaves some thin, wispy rings of lace. Aroma is yeast, coriander, grassy hops, hints of lemon and a little phenolic mustiness similar to that of a rubber band. Taste is wheat bready malt, yeast, coriander, lemon, some orange with pepper and dried grass hops in the finish. A slight  Band-Aide  phenolic taste is also presnet. Grassy hop bitterness and lemon, orange in the aftertaste. Refreshing but a bit heavy on the carbonation.","  rDev Pours a foggy straw with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is good.

I have been steadily pulling beers out of the backlog to try &amp; finally bring some closure to this CANsense. I like when I CAN assemble even a small brewery horizontal &amp; I really dig that Avery is CANning!  From the CAN:  Welcome to His Kingdom ;  The Maharaja Imperial IPA ;  The Maharaja flaunts his authority with a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant and pungent, along with an insane quantity of malted barley, fashioning a royal scarlet hue and exquisite malt essence. ;  Brewed with Rocky Mountain water, malted barley, hops and yeast.   I Crack!ed open the vent on my aged CAN &amp; beCAN a very slow, gentle C-Line Glug into the awaiting glass. I was heartened by the formation of two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with moderate retention. OTOH, its color was a slightly-cloudy Amber to Deep-Amber/Light-Copper (SRM = &gt; 9, &lt; 13). Let's chalk that up to being my fault &amp; give them the benefit of the doubt. Nose had a flowery dankness, like a fading bouquet with some green matter thrown in for fun. 8=O Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but on the approach. The taste was like a Sugar Daddy rolled in dank &amp; served in the middle of a flower garden. 8=O Caramel &amp; sticky dank were totally commingled while the floweriness provided a backdrop. 8=O Man, this in CANbination with The Reverend was beCANming too much for me. Worse, this was entirely TOO mellow &amp; easy-drinking for its ABV. Phew. Finish was cool, minty, hoppy &amp; very dry. Yum! YMMV.","  rDev Pours a lightly foggy copper-orange with two fingers of off-white, khaki foam. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is piney, resiny, dank, herbal and floral hops with hearty biscuity, bready malt underneath. Hops have quite a bit of bite and are 'old school' in their format, but still molded and melded together well. Flavor profile is herbal, dank, floral, piney, resiny and very light citrusy hops with biscuity, bready and lightly nutty malts. It forms a rindy, sticky IPA, and when paired with the light touch of alcohol heat, packs quite a punch. Mouth feel is medium-thick and quite heavy and full with a lightly grainy, moderate effervescence. Overall, hearty and heavy and yet refined and palatable.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can.","  rDev Poured from a can into a tulip.  Pours a hazy and almost cloudy amber/apricot gold with excellent head. It dissipates quickly, but he lacing is very persistent.   The aromas come from a variety of  hop  quarters. Citrus, resin, and weedy aromas all arrive, with grapefruit winning out. along with an  after  note of a vegetal variety.  The malt backbone in this brew is strong, but restrained, with the hops taking top billing in a tingly way. Not hop burn but definitely heavy-hitting in that regard. Malts hit the tongue followed by the immediate hop tingle. Crackery/buttery flavors in midstream give way to a multifaceted hop assault consistent with the aromas. Citrus, floral, earthy, grassy, resiny and weedy flavors are all there swirling around in a very complex stew. Yet the bitterness, like the malt, remains balanced and restrained. Just a hint of booze. The ABV is well-hidden.  The brew is definitely beyond medium, but doesn't  feel  that way in the moment. Still, this is definitely not a brew that easily begs for another glass. It is strong, and the variety of flavors are interesting and tasty, but busy enough to keep this from being an easy repeater. Of course, that isn't unique in this style. Regardless, the brew is easy to drink.  Overall, this DIPA features a wide variety of intense hop flavors, yet manages to remain well-balanced with an understated but solid malt foundation.","  rDev L: Filtered dark orange, somewhere between orange and dark brown cider.  S: Orange, Grapefruit, and pine meld to the point of being one unrecognizable smell.

Pours clear, gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is big pine, orange peel, toasted malt, and alcohol. Heavy bodied, bitter with moderate carbonation. Makes for an above average, bitter treat.

Stored and served at 42 degrees into a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Aroma – Citrus and flowers, some pine. Head – large (Maximum 7.3 cm, aggressive pour), off white, creamy and dense, good retention, diminishing to a thick seven mm ring and heaped rocky partial layer. At this point, the receding head has left thick rings of excellent lacing. Lacing – excellent. Thick complete rings of tiny to small bubbles: rings are connected by thin tiny columns. Body – dark orange, hazy but it could be chill haze. It isn’t going to last long enough to warm up in the glass. Flavor – Begins with a dank hoppiness which contrasts with the original aroma. Warming in my mouth accentuates the dankness as well as bringing out some malt. No alcohol, no diacetyl. Palate – medium, slightly oily, lively carbonation.   An excellent DIPA and lawnmower beer. If I had another four-pack, I’d mow the lawn again just so I could drink this after.  Appearance 4.5, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 4.25.","  rDev A deep reddish copper color with some carbonation. The off-white head is creamy and billowy is two finger head had good retention. The head did leave some lacing on the glass as the head dissipated.

Tons of pine flavor, citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemons), floral, touch of herbal, caramel, toasted bready malt flavor, and subtle sweetness.  A big full body beer, slightly chewy, medium carbonation, medium plus carbonation, and a full finish.  Maybe I am used to the ripping effect of brash hops profile, but to me this beer had a heavy malt backbone and the hops was just laced in between. A touch bigger hop profile would make this an awesome DIPA","  rDev Poured from a 12oz can into a Speiglau IPA glass.   Look is a deep rich clear amber with an off white head.

Delicious imperial IPA.","  rDev 12oz. canned on 01/03/2017  Pours clear dark orange near red with a creamy white foam head.

Color is cloudy dark orange with a nice off white 2 finger white head that leaves lacing all over my glass. Aroma is a bouquet of hops loaded with strong citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. Crystallized honey and caramel malts help to balance. Flavor rips your pallet with dank and citrusy hops that are also very bitter and piney. The sweeter malts help ease all the bitterness with caramel and honey notes. Feel is medium with nice carbonation. Sticky feel that finishes nice and dry. Great example of the IIPA.","  rDev 22oz bottle with my FW brewing snifter Had this many a times - noted on 10/17/15   The “High King”  Bright golden orange body with some partial clearing around the edges. A healthy tan khaki pillow head comes to rest over top. Nicely retaining with some persistent stick of lace. Pungent pine forest with citrus fruit zest, mild dank herbs and honey sweet malts. Alcohol spice is stingingly present in the nose. Candied grapefruit meets sappy boughs of pine and some mild herbal spice. Smacks of caramelized malts that give off a honeyed cracker flavor with some rather high levels of bittering units and lasting oily hop resins. Moderately full bodied with some syrupy moments. Just enough drying lift to save face in the finish. Some alcohol warmth that can get quite boozy at times while still maintaining its drinkability. Big in every way possible. The OG TIPA.

It's a sticky combo that resembles old school cough syrup. Incredibly sticky. Some hop burn at the back adds to the abrasiveness. Mild bready malts add a tiny touch of balance to the hop profile.

Classic West Coast hop aroma which I love and prefer over these new fruity hops. For an old-school West Coast DIPA, this is remarkably balanced. Not overly bitter and has some nice malt sweetness that is not allowed to get out of hand. It is a big beer that I think could use a tad more carbonation.","  rDev Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. ABV was 7.5%. Amber to orange colour, decent head. Nice hoppy aroma, not as strong as expected. Distinctly hoppy flavour throughout, but not really that extreme. Good beer.","  rDev A clear, amber colored beer. Modest off-white head that leaves a good deal of lace. Sweet malt and pine aroma. Lots of caramel, some pine. Malt-forward, late kiss of hops.","  rDev This is one of those beers that I remember hearing about super early on in my beer journey, but have never actually gotten around to trying it because I don't ever see it around. When I finally saw it, I knew I had to grab it. I know it isn't one of the highest rated beers out there, but I think I've hyped it up in my head for a while so I need to know what it's all about. Also the abv just increased to 9% with this latest batch  Pours a clear orange gold with 3 fingers of white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing, a decent amount of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass  Even for an imperial IPA, this is aggressively hopped and does not have much of a malt presence in the aroma despite a slight sweetness. I'm picking up on aromas of pine sap, resiny hops, orange zest, white pepper, doughy malt, and pithy grapefruit  This taste lines up almost identically with the nose, being quite hoppy without much malty sweetness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon zest, doughy malt, white pepper, and piney hops. The swallow brings notes of resiny hops, bready malt, a touch of menthol, pineapple, and white pepper  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a beer that's quite smooth and drinkable for the abv.

Brief one finger white head dissipates to very thin cap. Non-drinking side has some figures of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt base with floral, slightly piney hops.

Brief aftertaste continues the meld of the malts and the hops. Medium mouth feel, with some added presence from the higher ABV%. Good carbonation. Well balanced IPA, with its influences from the imperial West Coast IPA style.","  rDev Poured from a bottle - clear burnished copper with white head leaving substantial frosty lacing.

The accompanying aroma is of malt, hops and alcohol. That pretty much sums up the taste. It's boldy hoppy, sufficiently malty and delivers a significant alcohol hit to the tongue. There is almost no head nor glass lacing. It's not the best tasting beer, for sure. What it does well is remain true to its premise.

The smell is rich with hop bitterness mixed with spices. You also pick up a nice amount of earthy grains and malts in the smell as well. So far this is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with hop bitterness. The earthy grains and malts claim this American Imperial IPA down. The body of Maximus is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy is not enjoyable. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.20% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. This brew would go nice with dinner or a cool day, due to the higher ABV. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Maximus a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to.

Crystal clear.  The aromas are excellent, with hops very forward in multiple ways--floral/citrus/resiny, in that order. However, lacking the solid background mango/pineapple malt typical of the style.  The flavor follows the nose. Excellent hop bitterness. Skewed bitter, however, and not as balanced as a true DIPA. A bit of alcohol bite in the background, but not a burn.  The finish is the best part of the beer. Medium bodied with a nice crisp finish.  A good brew on its own merits. It straddles the line between IPA and DIPA very well. Just a tad out of balance and a bit heavy on the booze note.","  rDev From notes 12/11/11: Pours a nice coppery amber with a full, chunky, eggshell tan head that leaves nice lacing.

There is a hop bite in the finish that produces a lingering bitterness.","  rDev Nice, refreshing, well-balanced double IPA. Golden color with a little fluffy head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of grapefruit and piney hops with a little dankness. Tastes similarly, along with some caramel, vanilla and malt. The malt-hops balance is outstanding. Smooth thin mouthfeel with just a touch of creaminess. Good carbonation and the higher ABV is well-hidden.

It is a little hazy but you can still see thru it. The head stubbornly falls to a dollop, but is leaving huge residue on the glass.  The aroma is fruity banana esters, slightly sweet, a bit of bubble gum. White grape, some extremely mild funk, some earthy brett. A bready note supports all of the aromatics. Maybe a little lemony citrus to cut through the rest and liven it up some.  The taste is intriguing. Not at all what I expected from the nose. It is really soft. I get the esters and bubblegum notes first with a lovely malty sweetness, but with further sips the aromatic notes recede a bit and it lays even more more malty and spicy. It strikes me more like a wild ale, quite yeasty but with more than enough malt to tie everything together. If it is funky at all, it is very laid back. There is spiciness that seems like a bit of coriander and a hint of anise. It's fairly phenolic giving it a nice peppery sensation. Noticeable amount of bitterness on the finish, and there is a lemon note that lingers and helps reset the taste buds.  I'd call the body medium, lively carbonation, pretty dry. The bitterness, while evident, is pleasantly mellow.  It's unique - and somehow everything that is going on plays nicely in the sandbox to deliver a highly enjoyable drinking experience that I really can't put into words.

The taste brings in more of the same, a touch of mild clove and black pepper swirling around in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a Death Valley level of dryness in the finish.

Quite happy I opened this one up.","  rDev 330mL bottle into a tulip bottled on 4/3/20  Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color with a huge dense slightly off white head with great retention. Aroma is fruity and floral. Lots of sweet fruity esters including some banana and a big bubble gum presence. A champagne like grape character. Perhaps a touch of mustiness but I wouldn’t say that it is at all funky. Very nice nose. Taste is completely different than the nose. Almost none of the nice fruity esters from the aroma, much more earthy, dry floral, a bit funky with musty cellar, plastic, subtle underripe citrus. Mouthfeel has a medium body, carbonation is high, drinkability is average. Overall, it’s a very unique beer. Of course I’ve had this before but have just never rated it. I have not had it in years, the reason being I don’t love it. I appreciate that it’s a legacy beer, and it is quite complex and very unique, but it just doesn’t do it for my personal palate preferences.   4.25/4.5/3.75/4/4","  rDev Appearance: Poured with two fingers of fluffy head that retained exceptionally well and produced a solid amount of lacing. The body is an opaque cloudy brown that leans a bit more towards amber when put up to the light, and is just translucent enough to see the ample carbonation rising from the bottle of the goblet I poured it into. The only thing stopping it from a perfect here is more lacing, and maybe a bit less brown, which I don't really expect in a Pale ale.  Smell: The smell here is everything I would expect from a hike in the country after the rain. I catch wet earth, with mild flowers of the forest, apricots, pear, figs and a hint of plum from the orchard, and grain and barnwood from the farm with maybe a flight bit of grapefruit and while it's probably not the best way to describe it, all with a slight after rain funk. Really that funk, not being able to place it, is my biggest complaint and that it's a bit off putting, but it's kept mild.  Taste: There is a dry leather funk that permeates the beer, and it's a bit more potent then I would like it to be, but it stays to the background, as it starts with grapefruit, multi-grain bread and a hint of clove that gives way to pear and fig before floral and earthy hops take over and round things out with a slight black pepper touch. The beer constantly evolves as apricot, wood and orange make appearances. The only constant though is that dry leather funk, which I really wish would go.  Mouthfeel: While the funk departs in the aftertaste, the dry part doesn't which is a bit of a downer. That transitioning is great, save that ever present funk. The carbonation is great as it helps out the entire beer and the aftertaste is a nice cinnamon and allspice raisin bread with a floral element to it.   Drinkability: Medium bodied, although that seems a bit deceptive given the ample carbonation, and that is made known after it is consumed. There are two major things that I am finding undesirable, the leather funk and the dry aftertaste. They are conspiring to make me partake of one to temporarily stop the other, which while is making me drink it fast, is doing so for the wrong reasons. Thankfully, the other flavorful notes in the beer, and mild aftertaste in brings to the table outweigh these concerns.  Final Thoughts: I was warned ahead of time, that Orval is by far the weirdest of the Trappist brews, and I can see why. It's got a strange funk to it (which seems to be identified in other reviews as Brettanomyces) which I don't seem to care for, but I know it is playing some kind of major role in the aspects of the beer I like, as there is a lot going on with this one. This is a pale ale, so I'm willing to excuse a bit of dryness, and by all accounts the strengths here, overpower the weaknesses. I'm honestly curious how this one will fare if given some time to mellow out or age. Thankfully I bought two bottles, which pretty much sums up this beer. This beer is a curiosity that doesn't seem satiated, before, during and after it has been consumed.","  rDev Bottle dated April 3, 2020. Reviewed October 3, 2020  Hazy amber-orange with heavy carbonation. Off-white, thick, sticky, whipped cream, mountainous head with long retention, leaving sticky lacing behind.  Spicy, bready, with a little funk characterize the aroma.  The taste continues with the spicy bread, slightly bitter. The finish has a bit of funk.  Mouth feel is moderate with heavy carbonation tingling.

F - Great carbonation and fermentation explosion on the palate; still tastes like trappist even if some debate its purity. O - One of the great Belgian beers.

The beer pours a nice medium amber color, cloudy with orange marmalade hues and a foamy, tall off white head, that rises quite high even without an aggressive pour and has impeccable retention and lacing. The aroma is lovely, soft earthy funk, light spice, hearty cereal grains, sweet fruitiness, pear and banana with some leather and a touch of hop bitterness. The flavors are great, leathery funk jumps out of the glass, earthy and with a nice grassiness, light hop spice, assertive cereal grains and a really pleasant fruit character, pear skin with a bit of apple that lingers nicely. The mouthfeel is great, coating and very lively with a nicely carbonated medium body that finishes with a dry bite.  Verdict: A stellar pale ale and one of my all time favorite beers.

F: Light bodied, super smooth.  O: Good ale. Would happily drink again.","  rDev Bottle is about 11 months old. Bottled 4/25/2019, bought out of the store fridge. The elegant bottle unleashes a deep amber liquid with a slight haze to it that probably used to stand out but now looks like most American ipas. Crowned with a majestic coif of solid soapy foam fed by lots of active carbonation. The massive cloud sits comfortably atop the beer as long as you'll let it, leaving thick lacing when it does, begrudgingly let go of the edge of the glass. The nose is wild and tangy with hoppy lemon notes over a funky acidity. Grapefruit and tulsi tea and that distinct dusty barn dry brettanomyces smell. Taste is pleasantly musty with a little dry acidity. White grapes and underripe persimmon are there for me too. After dumping in the last few ounces with the dregs a distinct breadiness shows up that rounds out the flavor nicely. Mouthfeel is very prickly with carbonation and pretty thin. Overall this is a nice change of pace beer that was/is a pleasure to drink. No question its earned its status as a classic and with so many new money breweries trying their hand and kettle sour/mixed ferm pale ales this one really shows up","  rDev From notes 6/9/12: Pours a hazy orange amber with a very tall, dense, persistent, white head that leaves only hints of patchy lacing. Aroma is bready pale malt with fruity esters of banana, pear and white grape. Taste is a little odd in that it exhibits a saison like sourness, bitter finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste unlike other Belgian pale ales I've experienced. These are wrapped around a much thinner version of the nose with the addition of Belgian candy sugar. Good enough to get a 4 rating but a little odd since this beer receives too many high ratings and has long been recognized for its quality. My example was almost a year old (June 2011) to the day with a  best by date of 2016 so unless the bottle was mishandled the flavor should be true. I had this a year or two ago and remember it being better than this. I'll need to give it another try and update my review depending on the experience.","  rDev A huge, off-white head. Pours a reddish-orange with good carbonation.  Smell of banana, clove, spice, sweet caramel and hop. Wonderful funk. Taste follows nose. Lots of different tastes coming together. Spice and hop make unique combination of sweet, sour and bitter hop. Apricot, dates. Carmel malt detectable. Dry fine sh.","  rDev It's bottle-conditioned, and I suggest pouring with great care. The 330ml bottle had been in the fridge resting for a couple of days, and despite carefully pouring down the side of a pint glass, by the time I had 1Cm in the bottom, the glass full on top with foam. It took 3+ minutes of very slow pouring and not putting the bottle down to fully decant it! L- Dark amber, slightly cloudy (some final sediment lifted very easily at the end) with a vast pillowy cream coloured head that's gradually receding. S- There is a little spiciness to this, coriander for one thing. T- It's flavour-packed, and dryer in the finish than I'm used to from a Trappist ale. M- I've rechecked the lable twice now, 'Yep, just 6.2%!' It's quite surprising that it manages to pack such a hefty punch from 'just 6.2%'. That it manages it without faking body via rich/sweetness is doubly so. O- Could this be one of the few (?) Trappist ales that you could almost session? a) it's not a wildly high ABV% b) it's dry finish means the palate doesn't get too worn out with richness. Though C) Well maybe over in Belgium at their more reasonable local prices. Here in the UK it ain't cheap. Bought from Harvey Nichols (dept store) £3.50/330ml. Prod: 23/01/22019 BB: 23/01/2024","  rDev Clear amber hued body sporting a thick head; dense and lasting foam with sticky and clinging fingers of foam. A nice citrus aroma; lemon; some brett; spicy; anise. The taste is a unique blend of gentle malt sweetness, fruity esters, and a touch of phenolic wild yeast; some decent hop bitterness to offset the semi-wild and pit fruit flavors. Medium body; rather dry overall with some hop bitterness and phenol bite.  This beer brings some intriguing sensory qualities to the palate. On top of that, all its quirky and unique qualities magically blend together into an appealing taste treat. The beer balances otherwise independently strong qualities of dryness, fruitiness and sweetness, and a subtle yeast wildness into a unified and very approachable beer product. Words can't do justice to the character of this beer, so my best suggestion is to just try it. Chances are you'll be glad you did.","  rDev 330ml brown bottle. Label has 'BOTTLED ON 17/05/2018' and 'BEST BEFORE 17/05/2023'. Cloudy, orange amber colored body. Takes a few pours to fill the glass, because of the tall eggshell colored head that forms. The big bubbles dissipate quickly, and leave a pillowy, fine bubble cap and a ring that climbs up the sides of the glass. Not much lacing is left behind from each sip. Aroma is big on Belgian yeast and spices, with a orange/lemon citrus contribution. Some bready malts also. Taste is a combination of the funky yeast (dry grassy barnyard), orange/lemon citrus, and the thick bready malts. Rather dry at the end, and the yeast funk and the malts trail off in the aftertaste. Medium plus mouthfeel, with lots of effervescence on the tongue and in the mouth. The texture is a little chewy, and the trail off is dry.  Quite an enjoyable drinking experience, from the dramatic billowy head appearance and color in the glass, to the yeast led aroma and taste, which is tempered a little by the citrus. The malts form a solid foundation. The hops are subtle in expression and contributes to a mellow bitterness. After each sip the beer fades away with a dry yeast/malt tone. The mouth feels an active beer when sipping.","  rDev Pours an orange amber color with a foamy white head that lasts quite a while. No discernable aroma. Smooth crisp taste with a hint of lemon. Some hop bitterness.","  rDev Bottled 1/03/2017 Best by : 1/03/2022  Oooooo!!!!! Gusher.(On to my headphones , in part. :O) Lost about 2 oz. Back in a few, after cleaning up .  OK, pours about 2/3 foam, that dissipates in about a minute. Orangey-light caramel, with orangey-white head.

Some dried orange rind, and leather . Some slight tang, finishing with moderate bitterness, that lingers awhile.  Medium feel, with light oilyness. Moderate, fine carbonation.   Overall , quite good , &amp; I like it. Judging by descriptions in other reviews, I'm guessing that some of the flavors have faded &amp; blended in the two years since bottling.

Pours a light-ish caramel brown color, with a nice finger of frothy white foam that settles slowly into the body of the beer. Poured cold, but no patterns of lace stick to the inside of the glass.  The aromas are a subtly complex array of citrus and Belgian spice, with hints of tart cherry, raisin, and caramel. As it warms a subtle nuttiness emerges along with a stronger nose of dark fruit.  That signature Trappist yeast is present along with a subtle astringency that is present but not overwhelming.. a light acidity from the citrus peel flavors works to balance everything well. A lighter beer than expected, with a surprising minerality and grassiness in the finish. Finishes with some grain, caramel notes.  A little on the thinner side, dry with a lightly astringent mouthfeel. Surprising level of carbonation, but it has a smooth, warming finish to it that I enjoyed.","  rDev A: crystal clear; copper in color; a ton of bubbles rising; 1+ finger finely pored, pillowy light tan head that receded slowly to a thin cap; very nice lacing;  S: Trappist yeast, lemon, and orange;  T: Trappist yeast with orange and lemon to the middle, then orange and lemon with a little yeast through the finish; moderate bitterness at the end;  M: light to medium bodied; high, prickly carbonation; dry finish;  O: really nicely done; a pleasure to drink;","  rDev I will be doing this review in the form of a side-by-side comparing the 2021 to the 2019 vintage. They were both bottled in early January and are almost exactly 24 months apart, with the 2021 being around 13 weeks old at time of consumption. The score represents both vintages, as I loved them both equally.  Upon pouring, the coloration is very similar, a cloudy dark amber, which is perhaps a little more deep for the 2019, with some carbonation bubbles being evident in both as well, with both also managing a large, foamy head despite a very careful pour, although head retention is noriceably better for the 2021 vintage, which also leaves tufts of wispy lacing on the inside of the glass that are not present with the 2019.  When it comes to the aroma, as expected, the 2021 is a lot hoppier and fruitier, with some light doughy malt and distinct citrus notes and lighter herbal accents, as well as hints of estery fruit and spice, with some accents of apple and clove. The 2019 has a lot sweeter, maltier aroma to it, with very little hop aromatics, although the estery fruit and spice is a lot more evident, with the apple, clove, as well as some wet hay and hints of musty funk standing out a lot more here without the hops muscling in.  The taste very much follows the nose, with the 2021 being a LOT more hoppy and bitter, with very little sweetness or funkiness coming through, although the esters manage to show through here already, particularly with some spicy accents of clove and black pepper, but hints of green apple and hay as well, while the citrus notes of grapefruit, lime peel and lemograss really dominate this, with lighter alpine herbs as well. The 2019 is much sweeter, with the doughy, slightly grainy malts being more in the foreground here, although hints of bitter, zesty hops still manage to poke through here, but the estery, slightly funky notes of tart green apple, pear and lighter gooseberry, as well as quite distinct clove and lighter black pepper are much more prominent here, while is a mild, musty funkiness with a certain blue cheese character being present as well.  The body and mouthfeel is very similar for both, although the 2021 feels perhaps just a tad more lively carbonated, while the 2019 is a little bit more flat, although this may all well be my imagination based on expectations, In any, case, the differences are minimal here.  Overall, while the differences were certainly predictable, it's still fascinating how much a beer like this can change over two years, with the 2021 feeling a lot more hoppy, bitter, refreshing and easy-drinking, while the 2019 is distinctly maltier and more estery and funky, feeling a bit more refined, complex and richer. I can honestly say that I loved them both equally, with the 2021 feeling more like a classic Belgian Pale Ale, while the 2019 has almost aged into more of a Saison-esque beer, but they are both fantastic in their own way, with each containing shadows of its counterpart within it. Actually, as I finish these glasses, while the difference and shift in flavor profile is very evident here, it's not quite as massive as I had imagined and I'm very much looking forward to doing this again next year with a 3 year old bottle versus a hopefully fresher bottle that is less than 2 months old.  UPDATE: I just had the opportunity to try Orval at 1 and 36 months old and while the observations from my review above remain unchanged, I thought that it was interesting that the differnce between the 1 and 6 months old bottles almost seemed more significant than the difference between the 6 and 36 month old bottles, with the 1 month old bottle being a LOT more hoppy and bitter than the 6 month old bottle while the 36 month old bottle really wasn't as much more rich and funky, yet has started to develop some light oxidation, which also made me realize that 2 years is probably the cut-off point for me when it comes to Orval, while I really enjoyed the 1 month old bottle the most.","  rDev a: orange/amber color and clear. huge. 3-4 finger rocky off-white head. awesome looking head  s: awesome brett funk, lemon peel, pears, green apple skin, grass, grains, pepper spice, and a nice Belgian yeast spice  t: barnyardy, band aid, Bretty funk. green apple skin and ripe green pears. sweet lemon and grassy grains. lemongrass and mild peppery spice. a hint of clove as well. the finish is biscuity and like dry crackers  m: medium mouthfeel with high carbonation  o: fantastic Belgian Pale Ale. there is everything in here you want. funk, malts, Belgian spicy yeast, and nice earthy flavors","  rDev From a 330ml bottle, dated 06/06/18. Served in a tulip.  Pours a clear copper-amber with a big, bubbly head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, foamy cap and spotty lacing.  Clean, sharp aroma of brett yeast and lemon soda.  Tastes of pain de champagne, mushrooms and lemon soda. Funky, earthy yeastiness, mildly tangy with baking soda-like dryness.  Feel is feathery, tongue-drying, light bodied with bright, tingly carbonation.  Overall, a bright and cheerful, light and refreshing treat. Near-perfect for what it is.","  rDev Bottled on 8/11/17; best before 8/11/22  Pours a deep, cloudy golden copper with a massive white head, bubbly, fizzy, soapy, and sticky; excellent retention with thin, sticky foam providing a lasting film around the glass.  Aromas of pear, grape must, yeasty, slightly spicy banana, funky wood, composting fruits, and a general earthiness permeating throughout; enjoyable depth to this one.  Taste of grape must, yeasty barnyard funk, flairs of bubble gum, and floral, dense herbal and earthy root notes; clove, wood chips, brown sugar, dried banana peel, and light yeastiness smooth the finish; wish it would’ve lasted just a bit longer, but a well-devised and yet easy profile all the same.  Mouthfeel shows a smooth, even-keeled body balancing bigger, somewhat unrestrained carbonation that just works out nicely; very dry overall, but with a well-bodied effervescence showing through to the finish.  Excellent depth of profile to this one, with my only real complaint being a short finish. Otherwise, this is upper-tier stuff, and just an enjoyable, smooth-drinking, and comforting trappist ale. I'd love to see how this ages.","  rDev Pours a slightly cloudy orangish amber with a massive pillow of white head that lingered and left a nice amount of lacing. Aroma is spicy floral hops, grapes and orange rind. Flavor is vinegary up front with some yeasty bread, spicy hops. Feel is light and crisp, well carbonated. Overall not what I expected, would not drink again. I know this is fresh with a bottle date of 7 2 18 and a best by date of 7 2 23.","  rDev I have been cellaring this for almost 5 years, I guess it deserves its own chalice. Amber color with a huge thick beige head with eternal retention and leaving some laces. Sour aroma with notes of horse sweat, sulfur mixed with spices, oranges and grass with earth. Flavor with notes of spices, just a bit of candi sugar, noble dank hops, earth, oranges, pleasant funkiness, pineapple, melon with lemon drops and bread. Quite dry and bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body with effervescent carbonation. Classic brew with an original spiced and funky taste. This was fully attenuated and felt even better than the last one I had in the street.","  rDev 11.2oz bottled 12/15/16 bb 12/15/21 (purchased room temp a month ago) poured into an Orval chalice at fridge temp 6.9% ABV. The beer pours bright orange amber in color with tight khaki colored head. The head recedes to a thin cap but leaves no lacing. The aroma is yeast driven primarily with some hints of clove. The taste is sharp and grassy with little malt character. The hops are nearly gone and the yeast flavors of funk, bitter pineapple and barnyard are dominating. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, highly carbonated and extremely dry. Overall, unique and good. I have a feeling I would like this more fresh with a bit of the dry hops left before the yeast takes over.","  rDev Pours an orange gold color. Above average body but definitely is well carbonated which takes a while to settle down. Aroma is yeast,fruit,malt and some grain. Taste follows the nose, a bit of a floral bitterness shows up in the taste. Overall this competes well with others in this style","  rDev Poured from fridge temp. As recommended, I poured with aggression. Tons of head, but it quickly dissipated. A beautiful orange color emerged. Nose is bread, caramel, a bit of cherry, fig, and a bit of tree bark. Taste is really interesting. A slight bitterness up front - a bit hoppy and piney. Definitely a layer of citrus peel, cherries, raisins, and some wheat notes. Mouthfeel is relatively dry, with a citrus peel aftertaste. Overall, a really nicely crafted beer.","  rDev Pour is a slightly cloudy golden orange color, light tan head. Aromas are estery Belgian greatness and earthy hops.  The taste is split between the earthy hops and the esters from the yeast. The label states this was bottled in December 2016, and is good through December 2021. I’d like to try a bottle of this with 5 years of whiskers on it, because I think it would be phenomenal."]},{"Name":"Yeti","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/158/12013/","Brewery":"Great Divide Brewing Company","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":9.50,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while.

Pitch black colour, brown head. Lovely aroma of heavily roasted malts, cigar box and leather. Intense roasty flavour with notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and English liquorice. Brilliant stuff!","  rDev 12 oz can  Pours opaque black, tan head retains as suds.  Aroma is smokey, toasty, with coffee notes and some nutty undertones.  Flavor is smokey and toasty up front with some brown sugar, coffee, mesquite, and anise flavors.  Fuller body, fizzy carbonation on the tongue.  I've had some of the Yeti variations but this is my first time trying the base version. Very slow drinking and heavy. Flavor is robust, rich, but far from sweet. A very smokey, bitter stout which is an interesting change of pace in the era of the pastry stout. Definitely worth trying and though my palate is a bit trained towards sweeter stouts, I really enjoy this.","  rDev Let's pour a 12 oz. can of this beast into a clear pint glass for observation. The liquid is a dense black coffee color with an abundant tight tan head on top. Sufficient glass lacing is left behind after each swallow. Its roasted malt aroma is somewhat resembling cocoa. The taste is rich, with a bitterness contributed to by well roasted malts, some hoppiness and a hint of the generous dose of alcohol. This is a fine Imperial Stout, full flavored, well bodied and devoid of any unnecessary sweetness.","  rDev Appearance: Poured with a solid thumb of head that produced decent lace and retained exceptionally well. The body is as black is night as a good stout should be. More lace is the only thing that could improve it, but this is always hard to judge with stout.  Smell: Very grainy, which isn't something I often get from a stout, with dark chocolate and some coffee notes in the background. Warming was needed for it to come out and showcase decent potency.  Taste: Starts with grainy malt with a mild dark chocolate backing that builds with coffee and a touch of more burnt malt to a bitter height of which then a very apparent, strong, almost pine like hop presence comes forward that honestly feels incredibly out of place.  Mouthfeel: The transitioning was fine until you his the hop note, which leaves a resin like aftertaste that drowns out the pleasant malt and chocolate notes in the aftertaste. Carbonation is good, and it does a good job of hiding it's high ABV. Still, why add that much hops?  Drinkability: Good stouts tend to be sippers because they are thick affairs with bitterness coming from the well roasted malt. In this case the very clear hops bring that note to the beer. Anyways, it's certainly thick and drinks like a meal, but even as a sipper, it's not very refreshing.  Final Thoughts: The hops here are out of place for me, ironically, like you turned a corner and a yeti was standing in front of you, just sort of looking at you like  Yeah, I'm here, what about it? . Those hops I think get muted a bit, or changed up and I think this beer would be exceptional, but since they appear to be an awkward addition, it knocks this beer down to a mere good. Worth buying for sure, but not seeking out.","  rDev L- One of the absolutest darkest beers I've ever seen. Held to a halogen bulb, not a single photon gets through the glass, not even it's narrower edge. Pours with 5mm fine very deep brown head, slowly receding to lacing. S- Smells strongly of coffee, deeply 'roasty/toasty'. T- Deeply roast flavours, coffee, almost charring and fireplace timber log ashes. There is a prominent rich tang in the finish that is the body + 9.5% ABV making it's presence *VERY* loudly felt. F- It's extremely pungent, so is clearly a 'slow-sipping' beer for me, best suited to mid-winter. O- Perhaps the most pungent beer I've ever had. I'm thinking that after this it matters little what I drink as my taste buds will be blown out the park. Zero 'wrong', out of place or out of balance. If you like black espresso, better black ristretto, and seek it in beer form, this is perhaps the best fit I've ever yet to encounter. Ie. to be clear, I'd suggest you need to really enjoy super-strong black coffee to have much chance with this beer. ps. And it just gets yet more pungent as it begins to warm a touch... phoo! Bought from London Beer Lab, 355ml can.","  rDev 650ml bottle. Label has 'BOTTLED ON: MAY 1 2019'. Black colored body, with the thinest of red mahogany back lit edge. Two fingers of tan head, which sticks around. Incomplete sheets of lacing. Aroma of caramel malts, chocolate, coffee, with a bit of dark fruit and vanilla. Taste is malts flavored of chocolate, caramel, coffee, with whiffs of dark fruit and vanilla. Has a stronger back end of slightly bitter hops. Hints of licorice and smoke.  Thicker mouth feel. Smooth creamy texture. Very good carbonation. Slight numbing of the tongue. I have had this beer many times, but now distribution has ended. We think this is the case. This beer is similar to a craft root beer but with the alcohol. The alcohol is present but really never intrudes. A classic imperial stout.","  rDev Canned on 5/10/19  Pours a clean black body with some reddish hues at the surface, topped with a fast-rising two fingers of dense, creamy mocha head; great retention fades slowly to a frothy collar of foam crawling up the glass while a dense layering of varied lacing takes over and lingers.  Aromas feature bitter, nearly acrid roasted malts opening strongly as the beer steadily warms; a milk chocolate undertone softens the blunter tones as bakers chocolate and charred, earthy hops highlight a straightforward takeover of the bouquet.  Taste brings out bitter roast coffee at the start; a deep roasted malt tone transitioning with the help of touches of milk/dark chocolate sweetness along the mid-palate, offering a soothing interlude before a slightly acrid, hop-tinged bitterness picks up on the finish.  Mouthfeel shows a lightly carbed full body flowing like silk through to a subtly creamy mid-palate. The back end takes a more aggressive tone, with a drying, charred bitterness picking up through the swallow; minimal alcohol presence lingers.  A straightforward, classically styled American imperial stout in the best ways, it's unabashedly aggressive, but far too well-structured to lose itself; great execution in tandem with near-ambitious levels of robustness leave a truly enjoyable change of pace in a time when stouts are increasingly valued for their sweeter qualities.","  rDev Draft at LATEOTU. Black with huge fluffy beige head. Roasty aroma. Taste brings huge bitterness. Nothing out of the ordinary but an excellent example of the style.","  rDev 12oz can poured into a snifter.  A: Black as oil with a solid three fingers of rocky brown head. Retention is ridiculous. Sheets of thick lacing cling everywhere. Such an epic head and overall appearance.  S: Deep roastiness. Plenty of espresso and some nutty aromas. Bitter dark chocolate. Woody and acrid. Muscular hop notes of wood, bark, herbs and mint. Slight whiff of alcohol.   T: Starts with a nice pull of bakers chocolate and bitter dark chocolate. A massive wave of bitter espresso and roast envelopes everything thereafter. Hops assert themselves in a big way, bringing bold flavors of herbs, earth, and mint. Bitter on bitter. Very long finish of acrid and Smokey malt and lingering hops.  M: Thick, rich, chewy. You could cut it with a fork and knife. Fine carbonation scrubs briskly.   O: Not at all for the faint of heart. It’s a shock and awe sort of approach, cramming a lot of acrid and bitter roast in alongside plenty of bitter and earthy hops. The finish will grip your tongue and linger for hours. If you like a good espresso shot, you should appreciate this beer. A true classic that stands out in this new world of desserty pastry stouts.","  rDev Bomber purchased at the LCBO at least a year ago and cellared ever since; bottled Nov 2 2017 and served barely chilled.  Pours ebony black, crowned with one finger of bubbly, foamy brown head that lingers for a couple of minutes as it steadily wilts away. An eighth-inch cap of creamy head is left behind, framed by a frothy collar and a lovely coat of smooth, even lacing; looks fantastic. Its aroma is rich and roasted, consisting of cocoa and dark chocolate, as well as hints of coffee, caramel and earthy soil, and just a touch of pine-resiny hops. Hint of alcohol too, but that's hardly a sin.  Maybe not sinful, but a hedonistic delight nonetheless: my nose already told most of the story, but my taste buds can now share in the experience. Roasted malts galore, with cocoa, dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee and caramelized malt sweetness coming through clearly at first. However, the hops are not to be forgotten about, as they come ripping through the finish with earthy, woodsy, pine resin bitterness that combines with the cocoa/roasted vibe and a hint of smokiness in the (fairly persistent) aftertaste; the alcohol burn is perceptible but well integrated. Full-bodied, with low carbonation levels that hardly register; it feels silky-smooth and almost creamy soft on the surface of the palate. A very pleasing beverage to sip on one of the last nights of summer 2019; this serving size is best split with a friend or two, but I shouldn't have any issues polishing off the bottle myself.  Final Grade: 4.28, an A-. Great Divide's Yeti is a pioneering North American classic that I am honoured to have had the chance to try. As far as American Imperial Stouts go, it's one of the more traditional (i.e. RIS-like) examples I can recall sampling - not that there's anything wrong with that. It's nice to try a big stout that wasn't aged in a barrel or augmented with various adjuncts - though the XL-sized hop bill does give this one a bold bitterness on the back end that might catch some by surprise. 100% worth trying if you can find it... I'll be getting two bottles next time: one to try fresh, and another for the cellar.","  rDev Dark depths of opaque colors make up the body; head is dense, sticky and rocky; spidery webs of foam adhering to the glass. Deep charred and roasted grain aroma; dark coffee; cocoa. Full-on bitter chocolate flavor incorporating a strong grain husk and hop bitterness. Heavy body with lots of residual sugar heft; sludgy and velvety; mild sweetness yet overall dry feel from midpoint to the finish.  An incredibly rich and dense beer, not too sweet and fairly bitter.","  rDev I have drunk this beer before, but I have neglected to do a proper review. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour on the beer produced a two finger rock solid head. The head is a dark brown like coffee with a touch of cream. The head dissipated slowly leaving lacing all over the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 37 dark inky brown and is opaque. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.   The initial aroma in the beer is dark chocolate and french roasted coffee. Next, I get toffee, dark roasted malts, raisins, anise, and a deep earthiness. Lastly, I smell, bread, smokiness, and wood.   First thing I taste is smokiness, expresso, and char. Next, I get dark chocolate, Maillard, raisins, anise, earthiness, dark roasted malts, bread, danky, and wood. Lastly, I get toffee and burnt sugars.   The mouthfeel of the beer is chewy and dry.   The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and a full finish.   The beer has this extremely high char, smokiness Maillard, and burnt sugar notes that distract from other flavors in the beer. The beer is very chewy and full body. I had a difficult time pulling flavors and aromas from the beer. I spent an inordinate amount of time smelling an tasting the beer. The beer is good but needs to finessed for greatness. Not on my list of beers to keep in my cellar.","  rDev Very nice double stout - thick dark black color with some tan head and lingering lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and a little malt. Tastes similarly, along with caramel, molasses and some vanilla. Nice smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel and alcohol is well hidden despite high ABV. Nice mild carbonation. I do wish the hoppy presence was a little bolder though. All in all, a great offering from a brewery I will have to try more of!","  rDev A thanks to the commander of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz, can.

Aroma is roasted malt,smoke,leather and coffee. Taste is very similar, more bitter than some other Russian imperials but it's a great version of the style","  rDev Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smell is surprisingly hoppy, but still dominated by roasted malt and notes of chocolate, coffee and just a hint of vanilla. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by roasted, caramel malt with notes of rich roasted coffee and dark, bitter chocolate and just a hint of vanilla, but with that certain hoppiness to it as well. Finishes with a medium, dry bitterness that balances out the slight caramel sweetness nicely. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is a pretty interesting stout because it has that relatively strong hoppiness and dry bitterness to it, that actually works really well here though, along with the roasted malt, coffee and chocolate notes. Great balance, great stout.","  rDev Rich and robust, it’s almost as if Raul cannot get enough! Chocolate like Charlie at the factory, with hints of toffee and caramel like a winter spell.

The head recedes to an island and leaves behind lacing the length of the glass. The aroma is roasty cocoa and coffee. The taste is bittersweet chocolate that ends in roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is no hint of alcohol in the aroma or taste. Overall, excellent. World class straight up RIS.","  rDev Poured from fridge temp. Pours engine oil black with an incredible amount of head. Took me a few minutes to get the entire beer into a good sized glass. Really nice light brown head. Aroma is full of smokey wood and malts. Getting tobacco, coffee, chocolate, molasses, and some faint cherries. Taste is incredible. Smooth upfront, with a really distinct bitterness on the aftertaste. Not as bitter as I would have expected from the aroma. Lots of chocolate and tobacco. Also getting big notes of coffee. Dark fruit is there, but it's muted by the robustness of the other notes. Mouthfeel is, as you might expect, thick, robust, and creamy. Enjoyable stout.","  rDev Another famous brew I've wanted to try. I ordered it from Tavour. Yeti pours a viscous motor oil looking nearly black color with a mocha tan creamy head. It retains well and leaves a ringlike collar and lacing. In the nose there is coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, dark caramel, vanilla, and a hint of alcohol. These aromas open up more intensely as the drink warms. What sets this Stout apart is that it has a strong degree of bitterness from the roasted barley, espresso bean finish, and, especially its earthy hops. Indeed I found this to be pretty heavily hopped for a Stout. Indeed, the mouthfeel felt intense with its full bodied and viscous texture that was roasty and spicy with its combination of sharp pine and wood. Yet as the drink warms it smooths out significantly and unlocks other flavors such as dark caramel, raw cocoa, hint of cherry and even some grapefruit zest. Furthermore, the alcohol is well hidden, making this brew, along with its IPA like high IBU contents, a nice alternative to sweet and boozy stouts. I liked it a lot.","  rDev 22 oz bottle served reasonably cold into a tulip. Purchased while visiting the US.  Appearance - Black! Thick and viscous like engine oil. A finger of deep tan head is poured with great staying power. Impervious to light and many rings of power in the form of rings of lacing cling to the glass. One of the most ominous beers out there.  Smell - Subdued while cold. Some coffee and molasses with and earthy and peaty undertone as it warms. Wood and some caramel too throughout. Not quite as aromatic as expected.  Taste - Big and bold. Lots of roasty coffee grounds, plenty of piney hops. Molasses up the ying yang. Plenty of bitterness with earthy flavors and touches of tobacco and leather to close. Just a bit too bitter overall to make this easy to drink.  Mouthfeel - Thick, full bodied and dense. Sticky with and astringency due to the hop presence. Carbonation is medium low, but right for this beer.  Overall - A very good and bold imperial stout with just a touch too much bitterness for my tastes. Certainly Yeti deserves much of the praise it has garnered and is a must try on any beer purveyor's list.","  rDev Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout, 9.5% ABV, 75 IBU. Pours black and thick with a right pretty two finger brown head. Nose is roasted malt, coffee and chocolate, taste follows with a moderate bitter close. Outstanding mouthfeel, overall slightly outstanding."]},{"Name":"Pseudo Sue","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/72170/","Brewery":"Toppling Goliath Brewing Company","Style":"Pale Ale - American","Alcohol":5.80,"Score":99.0,"Comments":["  rDev Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA.","  rDev Pours a very cloudy golden color with a thick foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. Juicy orange citrus aroma. There may be a hint of tobacco when colder but gone when warmer. Nice and juicy taste. Orange and tropical. Nice and smooth. Medium bodied with mild to moderate carbonation.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  PKG05/18/21 14:44:54 BEST BY 09/15/21   Appearance: The body of the beer is completely opaque and a pale beige-orange color. It has a short white head with loosely packed bubbles that fades out to a thin layer over the beer and a medium sloped ring at the edge of the glass.  Aroma: The aroma really leaps out of the glass. It has notes of peach, tangerine, and a little bit of grapefruit. It smells nice but as the nose approaches the glass it doesn't get any stronger.  Taste: Up front there is under-ripe pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of lime. Towards the middle of the mouth there are more of the same flavors but some bitter lemon flavor comes through. It is a very bright and zesty tasting beer. The aftertaste has the flavor of a light dusting of confectioner's sugar.  Mouthfeel: It feels on the upper edge of light-bodied with a somewhat crisp finish. There is a bitter bite to the beer akin to grapefruit pulp. It works for this beer.  Overall: The flavor is really where this beer shines, having a bright and welcoming combination of citrus and tropical characters. This beer would pair nicely with something like grilled fish or a salad. It would be a great beer for a picnic or at the lake. It's really enjoyable and I would both recommend it and drink it again.","  rDev A 16 oz can with a September 25 2021 BB date stamped on the bottom. Purchased in Florida [unavailable in the Carolinas?] and served in a lager glass.  Appearance. Pours with a very cloudy yellow-amber colored body with a good white head. Looks juicy.   This is a bold but not challenging Pale Ale that showcases Citra hops. Quite juicy with fruity notes dominant but some grassy and herbal notes too, as well as a touch of yeasty bread. The aroma is a bit brighter and with more prominent citrus notes than found in the flavor.  Feel. Medium body with medium carbonation.  Overall. Excellent version of the style and a fine way to sample Citra hops.","  rDev A: Pours a hazy pale yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap  S: Citrus and tropical fruit up front along with some malt and lighter earthy tones  T: Follows the nose.

The aroma emits citrus, tropical notes, white bread, something herbal and something ashy. Licorice perhaps?  The mouthfeel is around medium. Smooth.  The taste is as first sweet and then juicy with a nice herbal bite kicking in for good measure. I can see why this beer is so popular. It just arrived in New Hampshire in June 2021.","  rDev Pseudo Sue pours a cloudy/milky looking orange/pineapple/mango juice color with nice head and a fragrant nose of citrus fruit. Pineapple, orange and mango. add those fruity juices together and some pine cones. There's your perfect juice bomb for hop heads. This is after a King Sue. So the hop bitterness is really perfect in this blend/combination. The grapefruit is starting to settle on the tongue and holy cow. bow wowowow This sixteen ounce can was stamped BEST BY 09/04/21 Thanks Total Wine","  rDev Must admit, the main reason I paid 12 bucks for four of these was bc I am somewhat of an amateur scholar of paleontology, and am fond of Sue, and the science this fossil has generated.   Much to my surprise, I find it ranked 5th on pale ales? Wow. Let's have a taste then.   Certainly this is a tasty one. It's also a well deserved data point in the single hop citra club. I myself brewed two batches of single hop citra beers, one IPA, and one cream ale. Both made my top six list. Additionally, there were at least three single hop citra beers available when I bought this one.   That being said, I suspect that the craze over citra might have influenced the overall rating on this one.   And now, with all that out of the way...   This beer is quite good, damn tasty if I quantify it appropriately. Citra stands out, but the overall character of a pale ale isn't lost, although the line between pale ales and IPAs isn't all that distinct in all cases.   Verdict? Go for it. This is damn fine beer.","  rDev Poured from a can into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy yellow color with a one finger head of pure white puffy foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent amount of foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is massive of a yeasty and bready smell mixed with strong aromas of harvest fruits as well lots of mango and orange. Along with these smells comes a rather decent hit of hops, with aromas of herbal and citrus being the most prevalent, but being accompanied by some smells of earth and a floral hop as well. Rounding it all out is a touch of wheat and hay, making a rather nice aroma overall. Taste – The taste begins with a flavor of a bready and light cracker malt taste that is matched by some citrus sweetness as well as a tiny bit of harvest fruit and a touch of lemon. At the same time there is a showing of hop, with a herbal and citrus hop being strongest upfront. As the taste advances the sweet citrus seems to grow slightly stronger and is joined by some mango and papaya. The hop also changes over time, initially being mainly of an herbal and citrus nature, but over time taking on some light floral notes as well as a bit of pine. With the flavor transitions that occur throughout, one is left with a rather pleasant and moderately bready taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly lower. Overall, the feel was pretty good for the very hazy, and moderately malty, nature of the brew and made for a rather easy drinker. Overall – A rather tasty and very hazy pale ale. A good, easy drinking brew overall.","  rDev Pour is a murky bright yellow with a finger and half of chalk white foam. Great retention and lacing. Nose is grapefruit, citrus, pine Taste is pine, resin, grapefruit rind, citrus. Enough bitterness to not be overly sweet. Finishes with a lightly sweet bready malt character.","  rDev Very nice pale ale. Poured from can to nonic pint. Hazy orange is color with a nice, full head. Foam gradually subsides with decent lacing. Aromas of of juicy citrus and tropical goodness with light bready malts. Excellent balance between malt and hop, sweet citrus prominent and ever slightly pine bite. Clean finish.","  rDev Big, creamy head of bright white foam, excellent retention, broad lacing stripes more than streaks. The liquid possessed of a bright yellow hue, fully opaque, able to see some bubbles break the surface. Pleasingly tight weave to the nose, crisp grassiness, firm maltiness, pine, onion, tar, grapefruit pith, mixed tropical fruit on the dry side, nothing tries to stand out and solo, all chorus. Medium-bodied, coats the full palate, dry yet with a creaminess which prevents any real bitter pucker. Strong melon presence to go with apricot, pear, mango, pineapple. Very subtle florality, again more by way of tar or sap than dankness. Maybe a hint of bubblegum. Its balance primes the palate for the next sip, feels very intelligently crafted. I admire it most for being graceful but not a stuffed shirt about it, crazy drinkability. Now if only the distribution chain could get it to New Jersey earlier in the drinking window, has been a problem with this brewery since it started to show up here. (Canned 11/27/20, best by 3/17/21, purchased 1/17/21 and just hit the shelves at that point)","  Okay, so now I understand the hype - this truly is an exceptional beer. As it turns out, this beer is now distributed to Pennsylvania, but not Texas as far as I am aware. In any event, I found it at a grocery store several miles from my mother-in-law’s house in Girard, PA while there for Christmas.  Poured from a a can into a tulip glass . Bright hazy yellow color with with the fluffiest white head and gorgeous lacing. Strong, fragrant citrus smell and taste. Wonderful feel and an excellent bitter finish. Glad I have tow more cans. Looking forward to reviewing King Sue!","  rDev Cloudy orange with a tall white colored head.  Smells intensely hoppy. Scent of pine and mango. Scent of willow tree. Smells woody. In Sum it smells intensely hopped.  Starts off milder than it smells. Taste of Mango. Bit of citrus but it is mostly Mango.  Mouthfeel is good.  Seems to be more cloudy IPA than pale ale.","  rDev Picked up a can of this and the King Sue while home for the holidays. This is a brewery on the move. Pale translucent body with medium head and a fruity nose with herbal and medicinal hops and grassy malts.   This is exceptionally smooth in texture, and the carbonation level is more or less perfect. The flavor is lemon and tropical fruits mixed with cracker and a hint of pine. Very agreeable and resiny if not overpowering in the aftertaste. I can see why this is so well thought of. Super easy to gulp down.","  rDev Stumbled upon this for about 3.50 a can. Great showcase of citra hops to pale malts. Not too bitter but it does have a lingering twang of herbal delight. Not sure if I would get it again but it's right up there with zombie dust. Good price for a pounder as well!","  rDev Look: It pours solid yellow and looks like grapefruit juice in color. It has a white pillow head. Head retention is good.   Smell: Big bold grapefruit and citrus aroma. There is a background note of mango and a hint of evergreen. It also has some doughy bread notes in the background as well.   Taste: It has grapefruit and citrus flavors. The mango is a little stronger as is the evergreen. It is quite juicy.   Feel: It has a medium full body. It does have a little bit of a bitter bite in the finish.   Overall, an excellent beer with plenty of flavor that blend very well together.","  rDev 16 oz can pours a hazy light golden color with a small stick head of tight bubbles.

This was very good and could see this appealing to ipa fans","  rDev Poured from a can -murky yellow/gold honey color with fluffy white head leaving copious frosty lacing. Nose is evident immediately upon opening ,heavy citrus with a sweet malt background and whiffs of resiny pine.

The color is a nice hazy cloudy amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with hop bitterness mixed with earthy grains an malts. So far, Pseudo Sue is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You do pick up some nice citrus fruits notes in the taste. But there is a lot of hoppy goodness mixed with earthy grains and malts. The body of Pseudo Sue is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. This brew would go nice with lunch or dinner. Really easy drinking. The mouth feel is Bold, Clean, Smooth, Hoppy, Fresh, and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Pseudo Sue a 4.75 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew brew up again givin the opportunity too. Toppling Goliath Brewing Company, did a super nice job with this American Pale Ale.","  rDev Pours a hazy golden color with about a finger of off-white head; the texture of the latter is a bit foamy. The aroma is a Citra hop lover's delight that shows off both the fruity and grassy sides. I pick up plenty of tangerine, grapefruit, mango, melon, and pine. There is a touch of onion, but it doesn't detract. I really dig the intensity yet careful balance of the nose, though the flavor profile is a small step down from that. Still, I taste plenty of grapefruit rind, orange, tangerine, and pine. The mid-palate has a slight bitterness that washes off near the finish. The malt backbone is perfect, with just a hint of bread and cracker showing on the aftertaste (no pesky caramel or toffee here!) This is very, VERY dry and very, VERY clean - I could crush these suckers all day. Carbonation is slightly zesty, but this one relies on the natural dryness coming from the Citra hops to cleanse the palate. This one almost lives up to the hype for me. It's not better than a lot of the local pale ales/IPAs I can get from Maryland/Virginia/DC breweries, but it's still a damn tasty and easy to drink pale ale that I'd gladly buy if I could find it on a shelf.","  16oz canned 5-7-20, best by 9-4-20.

The head started fluffy white and prevented me from getting a full bottle into the glass in a single try, even on a fairly light pour.  Nose is as expected with banana and an somewhat earthy sorta spice - coriander. There's a little bit of mineral to soapy note like some say of cilantro, but it is missing the herbal aspect of the leafys. Taste brings the mineral water backed by the coriander, with the wheat banana note being a very light platform for these to dance across. A little bit of white pepper joins by mid-taste, and I think it sorta counters and quells an slight increase in banana flavor.  The feel is fairly thin, and there's more carbonation than I expected.

Reviewed 10/12/19. Marked “Best before end: 08/12/19” on back label. On shelf at store, stored and served at 42 degrees.  Appearance – 4. First pour – Very light yellow (nearly colorless), slight haze. Body – Light yellow, murky, opaque. Head – Large (Maximum eight cm, aggressive center pour), meringue-like, average duration, diminishing to a stable eight to ten mm undulating crown and thick complete cap.  Lacing – None. Aroma – 4 – Coriander, yeast. Flavor – 4 – Flavors less distinct than the nose would indicate, but then this is past the BB date. Coriander predominates with less yeast phenols than expected. Slightly sweet. No alcohol (4.9% ABV) flavor or aroma, no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 3.5 – Medium, slightly creamy, light carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4. A trip down memory lane for me – I first had Hoegaarden in a little café in Toronto before I ever joined BA. What was that waiter’s name? RALPH! Or something equally mundane. And, much as I liked it originally, I haven’t had it since joining BA until now. So, a decent Belgian Witbier, even though in the clutches of INBEV. Seems a little weaker than I remember but that could be my memory.","  rDev Pours a cloudy bright straw colored yellow. Thin velvety white head with excellent retention. Surprisingly effervescent even through the haziness.   Aroma has notes of wheat, pepper, coriander, nutmeg and a hint of citrus.   Taste has notes of wheat, a hint of orange peel, coriander, spicy pepper towards the back end and through the finish. Very light, airy flavors. Flavors die off quickly on the palate.   Feel is light and drinkable. Spritzy carbonation.   A straightforward Belgian witbier that hits all the notes for that style quite well. Its a great beer and worth having if you like the style.","  rDev Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into my Hoegaarden tumbler.   Cloudy pear body with a fast-dissipating ivory crown; vague lacing; poor retention.   Floral/spice character from the coriander, and a touch of bitter-sweet tang in the nose. Faint sourness in the background. No real hop presence.  Light, vanilla-tinged grain character with a lingering citrus-kissed sweetness. Sort of watery mid-palate, with a brief vitamin note giving way to a floral, medium finish. Some yeast character, and a slight pucker from the wheat.   Soft, not-quite pillow-like mouth-feel - gently but fully carbonated.  Hate to support AB/In-Bev, but this is one of the style's progenitors with few superior examples available in my neighborhood. Good reminder I need to brew my own wit before summer really gets cooking...","  rDev From the back label:  25/07/19   Appearance: It has a big fluffy white head with decent retention.

Taste: The flavor is mostly this creamy tasting wheat and coriander mush. It has a slightly floral character and it is extremely mellow.  Mouthfeel: It is smooth and easy to drink.  Overall: It's an outstanding beer with a pleasant and gentle character. I would absolutely buy this again and I would highly recommend it.

S- Spicy and distinctly yeasty with an almost citrus/orange waft at the end. T- Dry, a little sharper than expected, spices (certainly coriander), and back to pretty sharp M- 'Clean' together with the complex pungency of spices. It is refreshing, and has a mouth-feel somewhat higher than it's actual 4.9% ABV. O- The spice is over-dominant to me; I don't drink beer to get mouthfulls of coriander this intense. I remember when this beer seemingly first hit the scene back in the 90s, it was so fashionable and of course relatively expensive. I hadn't drunk it in years and TBH it seems OTT/unbalanced to me now; defintely lacking subtlety .

Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a fuzzy, velvety texture that just soothes the tongue. It has a medium consistency. Overall, a wonderful beer around the 5% ABV mark.

Quiet nose, a bit of lemon and sour grains. Flavor has strong banana notes, lemon and cracker malts, and a tart close. Delicious.","  rDev This beer pours a very light golden color, almost white.

Only a skosh skunky and lightly waxy, Coors Light is white and sweet corn forward, which happens to turn to white grape after a while.  The tingly medium-light body finishes just barely semi-dry, very nearly fluid and wet.  Believe it or not, I've managed to avoid this light lager my entire life, but what better place and time than sitting on layaway at the Denver International Airport?!

Particularly if Modelo isn't available.","  rDev 330 ml bottle, now available in Norway. Hurrah. ABV here is 4.5%. Crystal clear pale yellow colour, big to moderate white head. Weak grassy aroma, not unpleasant though. The beer is wet and cold, with minimal flavour, just a little sweetness. No aftertaste. The good thing is that there are no offensive off-flavours - just plenty of Rocky Mountain water","  rDev A 12 oz. bottle of this has been located in the recesses of Dad's refrigerator. There's been no interest for a least a couple of years. It won't be missed. Not surprisingly, when poured out, it's a pale and nearly translucent amber, with no head nor lacing. Well, when it comes to light, this is no lie. Maybe it should be Coors Devoid, devoid of taste, devoid of character and devoid of body. Truly a terrible beer investment.","  rDev 12 oz can, best before Oct 5, 2020.  Brilliantly clear straw colored brew with a medium frothy white head with fair retention. Not much in the way of aroma or flavor. Grainy malt and corn. Hop bitterness is low. Feel is clean and light bodied.  Even for a light beer, this is light. When I drink Coors Light it makes me think of two things: 1. My best friend's parents drinking this by the caseload when we were kids. 2. My late co-worker who penned the famous quote,  I only drink Coors Light when I'm having more than 20.  Amen.","  rDev One of the picks from a mystery bag purchased at Outlet Liquors, Rehoboth Beach DE. I’m sure I’ve had it before, however, I’ve somehow never reviewed it.  Pours a crystal clear pale, and I mean very pale, yellow straw color. The carbonation is visible and fizzy, while a moderately large head soon dissipates completely.  Not much going on in the aroma except for corn and grain. Likewise for the taste, the corn and grain dominate without even a hint of hops flavor or bitterness. The corn provides sweetness, however, in a weird juxtaposition the husky grain has an astringency that is a bit rough in the mouth. Furthermore, the overly fuzzy carbonation doesn’t help matters. Light bodied and watery, crisp in the mouth and a short and clean finish.   I truly don’t get light beer. I can understand in theory how a beer lighter in body, alcohol and strong flavor would enable one to drink several. However, I simply cannot drink more than one-at least not this one- because the over-carbonation causes me to bloat and the adjuncts don’t satisfy me. As a matter of fact, I only drank half of the 16oz can and used the rest to marinade some meat for grilling.","  rDev And just like that, Raul is back in hell - Blondie’s Saloon in Orange, CA.  I cannot comment on appearance because I’m sucking this one back like John Wayne at his local watering hole. That being said, Raul has seen his fair share of Coors Light poured out into a pint glass and he reckon it looks like something similar to camel urine after its fill of water at the local oasis. Aroma and taste is more mute than Helen Keller; like, think of your great grandmama when she was on life support - this dang sucker is basically dead. Feel is lighter than water - I’m sure Moses would have ease parting it.   All this being said, what’s good about this beer is that it isn’t foul in anyway - which isn’t great, but it’s better than popping a liquid rust tasting Malt Liquor.  Peace!","  rDev (12 oz can, SEP1619, purchased cold single... poured into simple glass mug)  L: polished clear, pale yellow(?) - a hue drained of vibrancy... quite a bit of foam on the pour, tight and white; doesn't fizzle out immediately; keeps a thin collar, but doesn't lace much  S: smells pretty good - doughy pale malt, subtle hint of phenolic spice, faint touch of herbal grassy-ness... the initial faint aromas disappear once the liquid touches the palate  T: clean back end, Kix-like cereal note rather bold; little underlying sweet edge to grain; ridiculously dry finish and aftertaste, rather remarkable... the corny cereal note carries a little coloring of bubblegum perhaps; really it's overwhelmingly a dry cereal foundation, insanely dry  F: soft, quiet nothingness - lighter than water??... this may have the lightest touch of any light beer I've tried, the carbonation is even barely detectable; it all delicately presses the top of the palate, while the bottom 85% feels like a clean, untouched mouth - wow!  O: I originally planned to review this as one of my milestone-100 reviews, but since I have no particular sentimental association with it, thought I'd just knock it out as part of my 'summer swill' review series (light-er lagers of various related styles)... the few recollections I have of actually sipping on of these was that it was the most watery beer I'd ever had; this noted, CL may be #2 on my top list least delectable beer products, between Natty Ice and Michelob Ultra, but #1 in most ghostly presence - the least flavorful of them all!

O: A Midwest staple for those who don't know or can't afford any better.","  rDev I'm just drinking this for the style tick. This beer is thin and pale. The smell is faint but corny and grainy. Tastes a little sweet and grainy with some stinging carbonation and a mild bitter finish. I just don't like this enough to want to drink it. It is like a bad beer was poured into some seltzer water.","  rDev Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Aroma is faint grassy hops and biscuits. Flavor follows the nose, very bland. Feel is light and crisp, well carbonated. Overall disappointing. Had not my brother left this in my fridge I wouldn't have tried it. Wouldn't be horrible on a hot day while mowing.","  rDev On draft in a mug A: Pale yellow with a frothy head S: Bland. A bit of corn/malt T: Bland but crisp. Also generic grains M: Light-bodies, crisp O: Boring but refreshing","  rDev Pours a translucent yellow. Clear as a crystal ball covered in dehydrated urine. Head is a finger and a half of white fizzy, foam, with decent to poor retention. Aroma is straw, biscuit, salt, sweat, and herbal hops. It has an off putting edge to it, but otherwise is tight and well-rounded. Flavor profile is straw with biscuity, bready, crackery malts and herbal hops. Mouth feel is thin, with a crisp, refreshing texture. Overall, a refreshing beer with very little body or dynamics, but that makes it all the more simplistic and streamlined.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can.","  rDev Told my friend I would review this since I am coming up on 3,000 reviews and never reviewed it. Into a pint glass A - Pretty much as light and yellow a beer can get without being water. Was mostly surprised by the two inches of rocking foam I poured along with it sticking around a bit. At least it has life. S - Pretty much screams lager corn and husk with just the right amount of corn syrup pretty much the most beer you can expect from BMC. T - Corn and husk semi dry with just a slight hint of sulfur this beer will remind you of what a  real beer  taste like. Not overly offensive but not easy to put down either. M - Light to medium you would think watery but no it's a semi rough beer.  Overall not really a drain pour but not loving it either. Miles better than your typical Budweiser but still below the typical Miller offering this one is worth a pass. Try something else!","  rDev Pours a pale and thin straw yellow producing a white, soap bubble foam that is moderately lived but leave no appreciable lacing. Aroma is adjunct grains, sliced white bread and grassy hops. Taste is similar: Cereal, adjunct grains, a hint of lemon, faint honey and grass from the hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with moderate to high carbonation, prickly but watery.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) can into a conical pint glass; best by November 12, 2018. A: Pours a crystal clear, golden color with champagne like bubble formation, a three quarter inch white head, low to modest retention and modest soapy lacing. S: Light aromas of grasses and grains, although corn is notable. T: Palate largely follows the nose. Very, very light bitterness. M: Light bodied with moderate effervescence. Refreshing and thirst quenching. O: Coors Light is a drinkable light AAL. It is not a  big flavor  beer. It is very refreshing, very thirst quenching, and very sessionable. I have no stock in the company nor any axe to grind, but it is fair to say the ratings on the site are embarrassingly low. If you are open to different styles, you should be open to all styles and rate them based on what they are. This is a solid, drinkable, light beer.","  rDev Reviewing to style. Had this 16oz can at last weeks Vikings game at The Long House. Its an AAL so its clear yellow and fizzy. I like AAL this one however has very little taste barely a whiff of floral hops. Mouth feel is watery but crisp with carbonation. If you want a nice AAL i go to Pabst,Hamms,Mich Golden Light.","  rDev Passable but not where I’d turn to if I had to pick a light beer/lager. Thin yellow color with some fluffy head. Smells faintly of sweet corn and malt. Tastes similarly, along with caramel, grain and a little bitter aftertaste. Not much bitterness - actually tastes a little watery. Thin mouthfeel, decent carbonation.","  rDev Very light in color, aroma and taste. There is beer there somewhere. It is so light it is hard to call it offensive. Very faint malts and a bit of sulfur in the taste. Minimal grassy hops. Light in body and mouth feel. High carbonation, dry finish. Drink as cold as possible.","  rDev 24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 6/18/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Solid robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Nicely clean on lager flavors, with minimal corn/fruity notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is okay. Pretty thin/watery, but not too bland of a finish. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a decent light adjunct lager. All around solid robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Clean pale malt/grains and solid hop presence for the style. Not too heavy on the corn. A fairly enjoyable offering, well made for a light beer.","  rDev Pours a light golden coloration with a medium, foamy head that recedes quickly. Smells quite watery, with a light sweetness, mild citrus and slightly grainy note. The sweetness does not have a malty quality to it though, and seems to rather come from the adjuncts. Taste follows the nose: watery, slightly sweet and grainy with just a tiny hint of citrus and an unpleasant metallic note. Finishes with no bitterness and no discernible aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel with a very light body and strong carbonation.  Lacks almost any hoppy or malty notes except for very light citrus and grain. Also lacks any kind of bitterness, a finish or aftertaste. By far the worst non-infected  beer  I've ever had.","  rDev Pours a clear light yellow, with low head and plenty of visible carbonation.  Smell is very mild, a little bit sweet and just a fleeting hint of something floral.  Taste is equally light. Just a little bit of sweetness. No bittermness and pretty much zero aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is thin , well carbonated.  Overall, it's not terrible, but why bother?

Smells of slightly bready, caramel malt and candied fruit, with hints of brown sugar, spice and honey as well. Taste is a great balance of slightly bready, caramel malt and strong candied fruits, with notes of fig, date and plum, as well as lighter apple and apricot, distinct brown sugar and honey, with some spicy accents of clove and cardamon as well. Finishes bittersweet, with a strong sweetness and some candied fruit, brown sugar and hints of spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light carbonation.  While this certainly makes for a very rich and complex example of the style, it's just too sweet for my personal taste, which is somewhat mitigated by a light bitterness in the finish, while I can also appreciate those spicy accents, but those overwhelming caramel malt, brown sugar and honey notes are bit much for me, bordering on cloying, while the fruity notes feel quite candied as well, resembling those candied fruit bits you get in fruitcakes. This certainly has a certain feel of fruitcake drenched in honey to it overall and while some may love that, it's really not for me. I much prefer the darker and a bit more roasty and bitter Rochefort 10, which is a lot better balanced to my personal taste.","  rDev Dark raisin brown in color. Poured with a fizzy, tall, off-white foam with medium low retention. Aromas of dark fruit, sweet fig, and mellow dark malt. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Dark fruity flavors, fig and raisin, with mellow dark malts - similar to aroma. Very low spicy hop flavor followed by pleasant boozy warmth through the end. Finished dryly as the fruity and malty presence was overtaken by the booziness. A pleasant, boozy, cool weather ale. Very nice.","  rDev Sweet malty aroma, dark fruits, candy, figs.  Hazy dark brown / amber, tea-like color, with ample carbonation, dark floaties (but, I didn't really decant as I probably should have), below a thick tan head wit only moderate retention, becoming a thick cap after just a few minutes, and eventually scattered islands of bubbles.  The taste is initially reminiscent of a brandy; dark grape must with a prominent alcohol flavor. As the taste develops, it becomes more complex. Sweet candy, figs, dark bread, must, and alcohol. A very slight bitterness toward the finish. The aftertaste is the nicely intermixed previously mentioned dark bread, figs, and alcohol, ending a bit on the sweet side with a mild alcohol warmth.  The body is moderate to thin with some carbonation.  Overall, a very enjoyable Belgian ale. Enjoyable, but not quite the elixir of the gods its overall rank promises.","  rDev Dark brown color with a 2F head in an Orval Trappist glass. Wafting aromas of spice and grape, some fig or date. Just the right MF for this style. Exuberant taste of grape, fruit with a balanced bitterness in the finish. I tire of the same old IPAs. This is a world class act.","  rDev 330ml bottle. Label has best by date as '19.08.2025'. Amber brown colored body, with lots of dark brown sediment. One finger of light tan head. Aroma of caramel, dark bread, dark fruit and a little Belgian yeast. Taste is caramel and molasses, with dark bread, and spicy dark fruit. Medium mouth feel, with a numbing effect. Okay carbonation. Good for curing a sweet tooth, and the sweetness is well balanced by the dry yeast.","  rDev Pours a clouded dark brown color with a noisy, spongy, medium sized head. After a short glance, the head is gone entirely.  Smells of cocoa pulver, molases, scented wood among glazed caramel and milk chocolate.  Has a lighter and refreshing mouthfeel to it, due to a prominent, bubbly carbonation.  Tastes of rock sugar, bakers chocolate and gingerbread among grain hulls and toffee. Turns a bit drier then, as well as sweeter, with a noble hop quality, waffles and old coffee topped off by a drop of honey. Finishes a little oily, with more spices, light black pepper and maintaining hops, entangled into caramel chunks and muscovado sugar.  Although I tend to like my beers bitter or sour rather than sweet, this one certainly is an exception. The beer is very well balanced and complex, resulting in a unique, thoughtful flavor composition.","  rDev Bottle. Funny, as I had reviewed both 10 &amp; 6 probably about 8 years ago Never got around to the middle child. Oops. Well, 8 pours a dark, clear brown. Amber's angry sibling. HUGE head that grows like bread. I poured out the entirety of the beer and the bottom coughed out some yeasty detritus. It now adorns the humongous heads like a puff of cinnamon on a latte. Aroma almost seems hidden by the 2.5 inches of foam. It smells of caramel, dark bread, molasses, toffee and some light Belgian yeast. Not absurdly aromatic. Flavor immediately hits the calm part of my nervous system. This is one of those beers where the mouthfeel and flavor shouldn't be separated. Soft, cushions of sweetness and brown nuance! Like laying face first into a well-worn leather loveseat. It feels and tastes welcoming and warming, yet confident. 'Tis good!","  rDev Hazy chestnut reddish-brown with a very tall, active yet densely compacted khaki to tan head that's happy to stand over the glass before slowly collapsing from air pockets expanding underneath, leaving tons of coral lacing on the glass. I'm just floored at how hazy this is, it's almost opaque, but quite turbid.  Smell is quite spicy and phenolic compared to the 6, also exuding that apple pie character, as well as cooked pear, with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and clove.  Taste seems to temper the spice with a sting of alcohol right on the tip of the tongue which then recedes to a silky medium-light body where the carbonation is fine and only faintly expansive, especially relative to the head. The malt bides its time, only coming out towards the nearly wet yet semi-dry finish and exhale, emulating more of a zucchini bread with some pumpernickel accents. This ale overall leans semi-bitter of moderately herbal spice. However, hints of dark fruit develop as it warms.","  rDev 11.2oz 330ml bottle, fresh bottle vs being aged  Dark purplish color. Fizzy thin head that receeds instantly, root-beer-esque. Smells exactly like sweet and savory raisin dessert bread. A very bready and sweet beer, like eating (drinking) an alcohol soaked slice of cake. Overly carbonated - ready to age  Supreme ale. Very sweet compared to some of the other beers in this category that I prefer","  rDev Poured from a bottle -ruddy and muddy dark brown with thick khaki head leaving significant foamy lacing.Nose is mildly earthy ,yeasty and spicy.

Pours a chocolate like dark brown with 3 fingers off light brown tinted head that very slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  I immediately pick up earthy spice, lots of pepper and clove from the yeast. Some mild green apple, orange zest, and brown sugar balance out the spice  This starts off almost a bit tart with that apple character coming through strong. Mid palate, this becomes more malty, but notes of pepper and citrus help ot from being a full on malt bomb. The aftertaste brings notes of raisin, plum, and brown sugar without being too sweet  Medium-full bodied with almost no carbonation, this drinks dangerously easy for the abv.

Murky siena brown pour, with close to three fingers of frothy ivory lace that builds heavily and falls slowly. As it settles, large amounts of residual lace cling to the inside of the glass. Over-poured slightly, so some yeasty sediment is also seen slowly drifting towards the bottom.  The nose is dominated by bready malt and raisin, with undertones of caramelized brown sugar and molasses. There is a very slight metallic twang, but I'd imagine that's a by-product of the yeast and not of anything off.  Many of the same flavors as were found on the nose. Bready malt leads the way, with raisin serving the backbone. The major difference on the palate was the Belgian yeast influence. Estery, but not in a bad way, with subtler notes of cherry, and mild baking spices. Good complexity, as I'm happy to find in many Belgian ales.  A tad thinner than expected, but doesn't really take away from the overall experience. But while I'd prefer a bit more body, the effervescent carbonation and smooth finish to this works really nicely. Dangerously drinkable for 9.2%, with only a touch of warming booze on the tail.","  rDev 11.2oz bottle Best before end L13.11.2019 poured into a Rochefort chalice at just above fridge temp 9.2% ABV. The beer pours light brown with cherry colored highlights and a steady stream of bubbles rising from the nucleated glass. The head is light khaki in color and recedes to a thin ring and puffy island. No lacing to speak of, but the head maintains throughout the session. The aroma is very noticeable with brown sugar, cherry, red grape, raisin, plum etc. The taste is rich semisweet malt with notes of brown sugar, raisin, cherry and faint phenol from the yeast. As it warms, barely oxidized notes of leather &amp; tobacco come through. No noticeable bitterness, but not cloying. No trace of the ABV in the taste or aroma. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with well above average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, excellent.

There's plum, dates, and faint alcohol on the nose. There's a little plum, some dark fruits, dried fruits, a little almond, and chocolate.

That's what we're dying for, silly. Creamy mouthfeel, low bitterness, high hoppitude, and ever-lasting flavor. Brisk and refreshing. MMM, mmm. Not too high in alcohol, which is just what this needs.  Time to read the label:  This mouthwatering delicious IPA gets it's flavor from a heavy helping of citra and mosaic hops. Don't worry, no fruit was harmed in the making of this beer.   Citra is the hot hop these days. Do a pale ale or IPA with Citra and bing, boom, bang, you've got a hit on your hands. A wonderful blend, this, with a malty blend at the bottom, an amber edge, and the citrus notes doing nothing but shining, bright and summery.  Mmm, hmmm. Man, you drink this and drink it…it might even leave some zombies in it's dust….","  rDev Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is dark copper, transparent, head is light tan with frothy mix of bubbles and presents 1 inch thick, spotty lacing on the glass sides.   Smell is quite enticing mix of hops and malt - light caramel, light toast, mix of citrus and light tropicals with an earthy finish.   Taste is similar with pleasant hop/malt balance - light caramel, toast, bread, biscuit, yeast, then some citrus and earthy/wood characteristics, maybe light lemon.   Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness.  Overall a really great IPA - great malt balance and fresh, citrusy/yet woody/earthy hops as well.","  rDev 19.2 oz. stove top hat can from Plaid Pantry in West Salem. $3 Amazing this world class beer is available at PP after midnight among the bums, alkies and general wastrels! Pours a dark amber..slightly opaque..nice bubbly off white head..turns to copious lace. Aroma is of caramel and fresh honey malts along side floral and dank hops. Great stuff. Taste is very similar to the aroma..but has some juicy hoppiness as a surprise. Lovely semi thick mouth feel..nice for the cold weather.' A great IPA perhaps the best convenience store beer ever!","  rDev Pours a ruby grapefruit orange with off white head. Crystal clear. Some candied citrus on the nose. Loads of candied citrus in flavor, it's a little malt forward, with some sweet caramel, and finishes with a touch of shallot/red onion sharpness. It's a solid WCIPA but doesn't really err higher than that.","  rDev Clear amber copper color, creamy off white head, pine and citrus in the nose, resiny pine flavors, medium body has a crisp carbonated feel on the tongue, sharp bitterness in the finish, seems a little bit rough, not as good as I expected, still not bad.","  Can about 1.5 months old.  Surprisingly refreshing and crushable.  And comes in the tall boy format.","  rDev Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze.amber color with a 1/2 inch head.

Nice balance and pleasant aftertaste. Above average, but not outstanding. I wouldn't turn one down.","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed May 2014.  A fantastic showcase of Pacific Northwest hops with bold aromatics and a beautifully balanced palate. Definitely one to seek out. Deschutes never disappoints. ","  rDev Pours a copper color with about a half finger of head. The nose has both citrusy and piney notes. The flavor has a nice sweetness upfront that seems to be coming from both a citrusy essence and the healthy malt backbone. The finish is plenty bitter for a single IPA.  This is very a very solid and drinkable example of the style.","  rDev Pours mahogany orange with a chunky, long lasting tan head. Grapefruit, lemon, cookie dough in the nose. A wall of citrus, floral, pine hops in the first sip. White grapefruit bitterness and caramel maltiness in there too. Bready, toffee malts build towards the back. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Medium bitterness in the long, fruity finish.  This is a fantastic IPA. On the malty side. Very balanced and quaffable.","  rDev On tap @ Bent Elbow - pours a lovely clouded orange-gold with a puffy 2 finger cap....big pungent aromas of citrus and passion fruit over a musty malt base....Flavor is juicy with hop citrus and exotic fruits almost balanced with a sturdy malt spine and chewy torrified grains, light earthiness,... goes to a long wet increasingly bitter but rounded finish with a hop bite...one of the best Juicy NEIPAs out there this summer.","  rDev Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Fat Head's Brewery pint glass.  A: Bright copper and clear, with a good amount of visible carbonation. Two fingers of off-white head sticks around for a bit.  S: Tropical fruits and melon, dank and resin. A bit of grassy hops here as well. Light cracker malt aroma as well.  T: Tropical fruits, melon, and dank. The tropical fruits are reminiscent of pineapple and mango. There’s a touch of resinous and citrus rind hops here too. Biscuit malts add a bit of sweetness, but largely stay out of the way. A modest bitterness with lingering fruity hop flavors in the hang.  M: An average body and mouthfeel for an IPA. Good carbonation sensation, alcohol presence seems about average as well.  O: This was good. It’s maybe not better than a lot of other things sitting on a shelf around you. But still good. Interestingly, it was significantly better out of the bottle than I remember it being when I had it on tap about a month ago.","  rDev A: beautiful mahogany and ruby red with some darker burnt amber notes towards center. Thin off-white head  S: strawberries, pine, orange zest, grapefruit, resin, pineapple, and a slightly sweet sticky sugar smell as well. Moderate malt backbone   T: pineapple, pine, sweet strawberries, grapefruit, orange, and a nice herbal bitterness as well. Doughy malt backbone. A hint of mango in here as well. Pine and a touch of light caramel to close it out  M: solid medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation   O: nice IPA. Great balance of hops and malts. West Coast for sure. Great harmonization","  rDev From the left side of the label in white text:  PACKAGED ON: 04/29/19 1111 6255   Appearance: The body has a nice copper color. It has a nice opalescence with orange as light is applied to the glass and hints of brown without. The head is a short off-white and tobacco stained yellow head with a creamy texture spotted with large bubbles. It has good lacing and good retention.  Aroma: The beer has a mixture of caramel aroma and grapefruit citrus. It is a strong and well defined aroma that many would consider an  East Coast IPA  character. There is a light bit of pine at the end.  Taste: Up front there is some pine with a bit of mint and some cedar and oak wood. The flavors are excellent. There is a bit of grapefruit pith in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a strong bitterness which really drives the beer forward. It has a medium mouthfeel and good carbonation.  Overall: It is an excellent beer that delivers a wealth of aroma, flavor, and character. The best part of the beer is the woody flavor that comes from it, giving it the impression of a beer aged on wood. I really enjoyed it and I would both recommend it and drink it again; it is an impressive and worthwhile beer.","  rDev Bottle into pint glass. Pours a clear deep amber with a modest off-white head. Initial impression is generally sweet as opposed to hoppy. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium. Finish is malty and sweet. Overall, an undistinguished but enjoyable IPA.","  rDev Appearance – This head came up big on a light pour and showed good retention with a somewhat clear almost bright orange body.  Smell – This recipe is big on the citrus hops which is very apparent at the nose. There is some light wheat in there as well but mainly it’s the hops that dominate the aroma profile.  Taste – The beer is more rounded at the taste. The hops from the nose come across on the tongue and the malt base comes out a bit bigger. There’s a bit of wheat here and a light caramel compliment. Very balanced.  Mouthfeel – This is somewhere between light and medium-bodied, just a hint of dryness at the end, and slick as grease going down.  Drinkability – Definitely a quality session ale with nothing to ward off the novice drinker.","  rDev Unknown vintage; drank 2/2/15 @ Candlelite.   See-through dark orange appearance.   Fluffy white head; frothy tree-rung lace.   Orange citrus &amp; banana nose.   Mild orange citrus &amp; banana flavors; perhaps a touch less bold than a bottled version I had recently, but still a tasty, sessionable brew.","  rDev Nice rich amber color. No head really. Bar supplied frozen tumbler. Aroma was light and hoppy. Taste is light and hoppy and a little more bitter than what I like. Mouthfeel is solid and smooth. Overall, not a fan because it’s a too bitter for my taste.","  rDev Poured from a 19.2 oz can into a tall pub glass.  Pours crystal clear copper/amber with an excellent foamy/soapy head and good lacing.   The aromas are class, prominent, and solid. Biscuity malts forward. Fruit aromas from all over the spectrum. Ruby red grapefruit and lemon from the citrus end; pineapple and mango tropical flavors; and hints of peach. Grassy and herbal, rather than dank or resinous hop notes. Just a hint of floral aroma.  The nose was fruit-forward. The flavor presents more hoppy goodness, with some pine and faint dankness, but with good biscuity malt balance. The booze is a little heavy for the style--almost as strong as a DIPA. Not offputting, but a bit unexpected.   The mouthfeel is solid. Good carbonation; good crisp counterpoint to the fruity boozy maltiness.   Overall, an excellent IPA that, but for the slightly heavy booze, and although lacking any particularly notable aspect, is almost a paragon of the style.","  rDev L - massive, foamy brownish-white head atop a caramel-orange translucent body.

Happy to see Deschutes back on our shelves, even if it's only for a brief time.  Appearance - Clear and bright with a glorious amber appearance. A finger plus of light tan head rests on top and stays for a while leaving little foam bubbles that form lacing in its wake. Brilliantly clear. Lots of lacing.  Smell - Tons of citrus, especially grapefruit and orange with a not so subtle suggestion of cantaloupe and even lychee. A subtle weediness underlies the tropical notes.  Taste - Plenty of grain here, that's what I get initially with a very healthy malt bill and the tropical flavors are integrated nicely, but don't necessarily stand out. Orange and grapefruit are most prominent and the bitterness amplifies at the end of the first sip and keeps that moving forward.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, maybe a little stickier than usual with its amber ale leanings, carbonation is prickly and finish is fairly dry.  Overall - A very solid IPA, that while having some big robust tropical aromas (and less so flavorwise) has this grainy amber ale going on at the same time. Quite enjoyable and certainly a little different (and well rounded).","  rDev 12 oz bottle from an LCBO six-pack; best before Aug 15 2018 and served barely chilled. Always great to see new stuff from the PNW on shelves in Ontario.  Pours a clear, ruddy copper-amber hue, generating a full inch of puffy, soapy, off white-tinged head. It lasts on and on, settling into a thick, creamy cap and refusing to budge until I got fed up (ten minutes later) and dove straight in. Great lacing, too. The aroma is nice enough but not exactly spectacular - there's some caramelized sugars and grainy malts apparent on the nose, which are barely edged out of the limelight by the hops. The totality of the latter's contribution amounts to some muddled citrus, flowers and a resiny, earthy quality.  Tastes fine, though it does strongly remind me of a red/amber ale vs. a 'juicy' IPA. The robust malt backing has a fair bit to do with that, with its bready notes and lightly caramelized sweetness providing plenty for the hop profile to interplay with. I'm getting notes of orange and grapefruit by mid-sip, together with minor suggestions of honeydew melon, bubble gum and indeterminate berries. It becomes more earthy, herbal and resiny towards the finish, with just enough bitterness to counteract the malts before fading; some mild fruitiness in the aftertaste wraps things up nicely. Medium in body, with low carbonation levels and a very smooth, somewhat slick mouthfeel that enables this strong-ish ale to be poured down the hatch with little resistance.   Final Grade: 3.89, a B+. Deschutes Fresh Squeezed is a better-than-average IPA, albeit one which straddles the fringes of becoming a straight-up red ale. Note that this is not a complaint - in fact, without the strong malt presence, I don't think I would've liked this one as much as I did. Good stuff; I'll pick up another sixer if the supply line and middlemen (cough) can manage to get fresh stock on the shelves. Now how about sending some more Black Butte our way, hmm? Pretty please?","  rDev 6/26/18...orange rusty color, heavy foam. Notes of grapefruit and citrus. Smooth flavorful citrus juicy malt. Late lingering rind based bitter. Very fresh. As if the hops were squeezed into the can. Outstanding.","  rDev This IPA makes the choice of dankness with a green smell : onion, dank grapefruit, other vegetables. The caramel is quite present too and goes along the moderate to high bitterness. It seems like its higher in abv. It's a decent brew but I wouldn't have a second one in a row","  rDev Very well-balanced IPA, definitely juicy and flavorful as billed. Interesting red-orange color with some nice head and mild lingering lacing. Smells of fruity hops and some malt. Tastes strongly of fruity hops, especially lemon and orange peel.

The taste is as advertised: orchard fruit esters piling onto a pils + candy sugar base (I’m guessing) with not quite enough pepper or clove, but an unexpected hint of earth instead, then a bunch of hop aromas without much bitterness.  This is too sweet, both literally + sensually. The main thing about saison, to me, is the dryness, and regardless of the final gravity, this doesn’t give the impression of finishing dry. You’d never call this “crisp”. I’ve heard it’s American hops in here; if so, they’re boosting the esters with citrus + other fruit where they shouldn’t be. And the 38 IBUs need to be closer to 45 or even 50.  Don’t get me wrong, the craftsmanship is on point: handsome, burn-free, and goes down easy.  And I read where this is a food beer; I can see that - it *needs* food to cut through all the fruit on show here.  But it’s not what the Belgians call “digestible” - and whatever its other merits, I can’t forgive it that.  I wanted to love this, and it’s tasty, but I didn’t want a second.","  rDev Drinking this at home. Poured from a 16 ounce can into a pint glass.

The Pour created a frothy and creamy white head with excellent retention. The slow dissipation left gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, pale straw with amber hues. Yeasty particles prevent clarity.   The aromas are funky farmhouse, straw, a touch of horse blanket, earthiness, floral esters, a touch of cloves, and herbal notes.   I taste a touch of horse blanket, cloves, toasted crackers, bready, floral esters, oranges, white pepper, herbal, straw, and a touch of farmhouse funk.

Lots of fine particulate suspended in the beer. Nose of grapefruit, mango, pineapple and brett. Plenty of yeast esters but I don't get dry hops. Mouthfeel is initially prickly, dense bodied, slightly syrupy. Carbonation is less than most saisons, curious if they bottle or keg higher, I'd guess about 2.25-2.5 carbs.Definitely not 3+. Taste is a recap of the aroma. Brett, tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, guava, medium bitterness, a bit of alcohol and pepper in the finish. Starts out sweet and finishes dry. Apparently hopped with simcoe and amarillo. Just enough bitterness in the aftertaste that it finishes quite nice and I could see this pairing well with a meat and cheese plate.

For the first, I was anticipating more of a traditional saison and was unprepared for what this beer actually is. With the second tasting, I knew going in what the beer's character was, so the writeup is perhaps a bit more fair to what the brewer was obviously going for.  Aroma: The aroma is subtle; Citrus, perhaps a very slight funk, sweet bread, slight fruit - banana.  Tall, slightly off-white, thick head that is creamy on top and airy on the sides next to the glass. Clear yellow-gold color with a steady column of bubbles rising from the center, and broadly across the body of the beer. The head has long lasting retention and leaves disconnected strings of lacing.  Taste is tart citrus up front, grapefruit primarily, hints of the banana from the yeast, subdued funk, quite bitter, with melon coming in in the middle through to the finish. Crackery malts provide a good foundation. The finish is dry, citrus, and with increasing bitterness. The aftertaste is a mixture of citric acid and piney bitterness, with the iconic Belgian yeast flavors well subdued underneath. The tartness promised in the initial taste has pretty much disappeared by the aftertaste, replaced with a finish more resiny IPA-like than saison-like. In the late aftertaste, just hints of the yeast flavors.   Feel is medium-thin, with a decent presence from the carbonation, but not the sparkling feel of some other saisons.  Overall, the Americanization of the saison by Boulevard has created what might fairly be called an India Pale Saison. Maybe that's what the brewer means by  American  saison. If you like the flavor (citrus and pine) and bitterness (resiny) of American IPAs, then you'll enjoy this take on a saison. It is reasonably well done if looked on in that light, although the yeast flavors, being significantly in the background when present at all, are a downgrade for a saison.  Personally, I am not a fan. The iconic flavors and feel that the style  Saison  suggests play second fiddle (or third fiddle) to the American hops.","  rDev 12oz bottle  Dehydrated piss color, good amount of foam that sticks around. Big juicy grapefruit hop aroma after cracking this one, adds a sugary cookie aspect to the scent after warming a little.

Aroma is Belgian yeast funk, herbal fruitiness notes of banana, lemon, pineapple and pear; clove, egg whites, thin coriander, peppery spice, mild pine hops with white bread and cracker malts.

Not as spicy as some other Saisons, and a touch heavier so be careful","  rDev Hazy gold color. Huge white head that persists. A little bit of lace. Peppery citrus aroma. Grapefruit taste with late pepper. Light to medium bodied. Nice beer.","  rDev As someone who drinks a lot of Belgian saisons, I've been wanting to try this one for a while. The nose holds up to those on this side of the Atlantic. It has nice phenols, white pepper, and some citrus to balance it out. The taste starts strong but quickly turns the wrong way. I'm not sure if it is the high ABV, but there is a lingering astringency and a slight off flavor in the finish that prevents this from being a great beer. Overall, enjoyable but not as good as I was hoping for.","  rDev Dark yellow with a murky unfiltered haze. Poured with a tall, billowy, bright white foam with very good retention. Sweet banana estery aromas, with fresh, lightly tart fruity and light peppery notes, and light perfumy floral notes as well. Sweet malty aromas. Medium bodied with soft, effervescent carbonation. Creamy smooth feel despite the high carbonation followed b mellow warmth near the finish. Sweet banana and fruit flavors with sweet malt, candy sugar and hints of bubblehum. Medium light bitterness through the middle coupled with light fruit tartness. Sweet banana esters and light fruitiness return on the back end. Finished semi-dryly with sweet malt and candied fruit flavors with a hint of tartness. A plethora of aromas and flavors that seems to change with every sip. Sticky sweet and very tasty with fabulous mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable.","  rDev I'm finally getting a chance to try this beer. Boulevard just recently made their appearance back into Tennessee and I'm very glad they did. I missed this one the first time around.  this one hits all of the right notes for a traditional Belgian Farmhouse ale. that being said, it also brings a Slight bitterness to the game that I find rather appealing. Slightly less funky than many of its counterparts, the twist is rather nice and for a beer that I will be able to grab off of the shelf regularly, I am going to purchase this early and often.   Very very enjoyable if you like saisons....","  rDev Pours to a nice lacy permanent head and hazy straw gold. Aroma is grainy, spicy herbal. Flavor is the comforting malt of a lager, the zing of a belgian ale and the hop bite of an APA. On the sweet side. Moutfeel is strange, it feels like it has gelatin in it. Overall a tasty, enjoyable Saison.","  rDev 12oz bottle purchased at a place and price that I've forgotten.  Whoa! Big, foamy beast! Honey colored, and rather hazy. Big, creamy white head, that left lots of lace.  Big, spicy nose. Also a little grassy and herbal.  Pretty much tastes as advertised. It is a little more herbal and sneaky bitter than most Saisons of my acquaintance but it works well. High alcohol content is well hidden.  Fairly light bodied, with that somewhat effervescent mouthfeel so many American breweries fail to capture when they try Belgian styles.  I really like this beer. While the herbal, grassy, tart elements verge on witbier territory, it's very drinkable stuff. I would definitely drink this again.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy light golden color with a frothy white head that lasts and leaves good lacing. Aroma has Belgian yeast, banana, apricot, and spices. Taste is initially sweet and fruity before the earthy malts and yeast kick in. Finish is long and bitter, with citrus hops."]},{"Name":"Heineken Lager Beer","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/246/","Brewery":"Heineken Nederland B.V.","Style":"Lager - European Pale","Alcohol":5.00,"Score":64.0,"Comments":["  rDev I used to appreciate its crisp citrus perfumed aroma, often accompanied by a fresh seafood meal - but alas, I grew tired of it. I'm not the only one. It once was a half-decent local brand in the Netherlands, but those days are gone - its position as international swill is firm. However, the beer is not undrinkable, and I won't turn down a fresh glass from tap on a sunny day.","  rDev From a green 12 oz. bottle it came. Yes, with that familiar smell that is often described as  skunky . The color is a bright and translucent light amber. There's no appreciable head nor glass lace. It drinks thinly sweet, thinly hoppy and thinly bodied. After years of drinking this, it remains consistent. Something to go to when nothing better is available.","  rDev Bought this at a grocery store. 12 pack $13 + tax. Cans. Poured from a can into a pint glass. Appears golden yellow with a white foamy head that dropped quickly. Smells lightly bready, grassy, lightly floral. Taste follows the nose, maybe a little corn? Mouth feel is medium light for the style. Overall, not bad for the price. I think the cans might help with skunking. I would definitely buy this again, on sale.","  rDev Drinking this gives me a headache. It’s something I learned some time ago, and yet there are times where I’ll find this on offer along with the BMC gang, so I end up going for the green bottle all over again. Musty, fizzy, and just not that good. Stick to craft!","  rDev Thanks, Rich(?) Best by June 2020.  Straw yellow with a dense white head that falls off leaving no lacing, this looks ok. The nose is sweet cereal, sweet corn, light minty hops and a mild carbonic acid note. The palate opens sweet, bubbly and brisk with a blend of cereal, honey, a little sweet corn with a mild hop note present. Very little bitterness. Thin and watery on the finish. Like a sweeter alcoholic soda.","  rDev Pours a translucent golden-copper with a finger and a half of white, foamy head. Head retention is good. Aroma is crackery, wafery, biscuity malts with herbal, floral, and grassy-zesty hops. It has a spark, but is light. Flavor profile is crackery, wafery, biscuity, lightly nutty and bready malts with herbal, floral, grassy and zesty hops. There is a light zing along with the initial maltiness. Eventually, it drys out on the palate, allowing the wafery malts to linger long after each sip. Mouth feel is thin with a light crispness to it. Overall, crisp and light with an unoffensive, mild flavor profile.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 24oz can.","  rDev Decanted from an 16 oz (473 ml) can into a nonic glass; best by June 2020. A: Pours a crystal clear, yellow color with a robust, foamy, 2 to 3 finger, white head formation, moderately good retention, and decent lacing. S: Aromas of grasses and grains, but I can detect a whiff of honeysuckle. T: Basically dry. Flavors follow nose with the addition of a little more than light bitterness. Clean, crisp finish. M: Very light bodied with low to moderate carbonation after pour. O: A very well made, eminently drinkable European Pale Lager. So, so much better out of the can -- in fact, I have never rated it because I could not obtain a green bottle than wasn't skunked. I can see why it was the number one import for so many years. My main gripe is the fairly low evidence of carbonation after the pour, but it still does not justify the low scores pale lagers generally get.","  rDev Pours a crystal clear bright yellow with a thick white cap, minimal lacing. Aroma is faint, corn and biscuit. Flavor follows the nose with a light noble hop touch in the finish. Feel is nice and crisp. Overall better than I remember.","  rDev This was so-so. Ok - almost a solid 3/5. I remember it being stronger and more flavorful when I used to drink it, but of course that was 10-15 years ago. Now my palate is likely changed forever. Clear slightly darker golden color, really no head or lacing, and just faint thin streaming bubbles. Faintly smells of corn and malt. Tastes similarly. No real hops or depth. A little too sweet, but not cloyingly so. No metallic hard water aftertaste. Crisp, thin, mild mouthfeel, quickly fading carbonation. Goes flat quite quickly. Probably won’t have any more of these.","  rDev Out of the bottle it was crisp with some dank malts. This Lager at one time was a benchmark along the likes of Michelob,Lowenbrau back in the day. This is no more than a Label that is nothing what it was. It is however very nice on a hot beach day for me like today. It could be any AAL .","  rDev Maybe I just got lucky with a fairly fresh, well stored bottle, but I enjoyed a bottle of Heineken I had tonight at a house party - haven’t had one in years.  The taste was pleasantly fruity and refreshing and the beer went great with the spicy New Mexican green chilis served with the cheese burgers, brats and chicken.   I remember having unpleasant skunky Heineken s - but this was not one of them!","  rDev Pours a clear straw producing 2 fingers of white, rapidly diminishing head that leaves a thin film of surface foam &amp; no lacing. Aroma is sweet grain &amp; biscuit, grass &amp; lemon notes and a floral, skunky, metallic hint. Taste is crisp biscuit/cracker malt, metallic, lemon &amp; skunk. The skunkiness increases &amp; dominates the finish &amp; aftertaste.  Over the years (I've been drinking beer since the mid-70's) I have consumed untold bottles of this stuff due to its wide availability &amp; have found the aroma &amp; taste to be somewhat variable in this skunky &amp; metallic character. The skunk must be product of handling, packaging &amp; time. Green bottles and blue light!  After writing the above I couldn't stand not knowing if the same aroma and taste could be found in can packaged or draft Heineken. I purchased a large can for reevaluation and observed the following:  Pours a clear gold producing 2+ fingers of white, rapidly diminishing head which recedes to a surface cap of foam leaving a little splotchy lacing along the sides of the glass. Aroma is sweet grain &amp; biscuit, grass &amp; lemon notes with a metallic essence but none of the skunkiness found in the bottle. Taste is sweet grain, crisp biscuit/cracker malt, grass &amp; light lemon notes with a metallic aftertaste but none of the aforementioned bottle skunkiness. Heineken without the skunk! For those who have developed a fondness for Heineken from the bottle they will find a different dimension in the can.","  rDev Pours a filtered golden color with a bigger head, receeding to a small film of lacing atop the liquid.  Smells of light wheat, crackers and a note of coppery caramel.  Has a light and refreshing mouthfeel, due to a well rounded, effervescent carbonation and an easy drinking, light body.  Tastes of white bread dough, a sparkly, mineralic aqueous quality, and dried grass, which generates a lighter bitterness. Turns drier then, with the malts surprisingly turning a bit lighter, opening up the palate for a decent, longer lasting hop dryness. Finishes with a prevailing bitterness atop a very silk appearing aqueous foundation, which remains interesting due to its perfectly nuanced carbonation.  This is a very solid, thoughtfully and clean executed lighter lager with an astonishing rustic, herbal dryness. Its hoppy edge sets this miles away from many other industrial brewed beers of its kind.","  rDev 24oz can bb January 2019 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on can. The beer pours bright, light golden yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a tiny bit of lacing. The aroma is mild and fruity with an apple or pear essence. The taste is a bit of soft malt with a white grape/apple/pear taste. No real bitterness but not sweet. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. There is just a hint of butter on the finish, but it's minimal. Overall, very good Euro Pale Lager.","  rDev (22 oz green bottle, purchased cold... split between a glass mug and a trumpet-shaped pilsner glass - - review #1200)  L: crystal-clear, golden yellow liquid; surprisingly a good bit of foam forms on the pour and slowly recedes... bottle says a 12 oz serving has 142 calories, 11g carbs, 2g protein; ingredients: water, malted barley, hop extract... actually some wide bands of lace, I'll be damned  S: very familiar, semi-skunky European lager smell (Beck's is similar, et al)... no hops... wet grass, grape skin / sultana (golden raisin)... can't get much aroma outta something like this... perfumed polyester, drying cereal grain on the stalk  T: actually rather relatively richly malty, and I dare say it's tasty... with its soft, herbal bitterness and subtle phenolic spiciness (both of which persist for its duration), it comes across like a reduced-strength malt liquor... the malt flavor has a subtle note golden baguette / white bread roll crust  F: sizzles a touch on the tip of the tongue and at the back of the throat with each sip... definitely ain't seltzer water - this has some layered, arguably rich body to it, though it finishes fairly dry, though fading out, not with a sharp snap  O: wanted to review a can of this - I'll come back later and put can review notes here to compare... two most prominent memories of this was 1) at 15, on the way to my first real concert (Page &amp; Plant, Phila. Spectrum) my pops buying cans of this for me and my two friends at a cheesesteak joint and 2) having a bottle of this at a bar in Amsterdam (in 2002) and marveling at the difference in flavor compared to what we get here in the U.S. - also remember the bottle saying 'pilsner' instead of 'lager'... the Frank Booth quote from Blue Velvet will always come to mind too... all told, this to me is much better than a U.S. macro adjunct lager any day - I suppose switching to the hop extract did some good to its flavor too - - I'm floored, this was great","  rDev Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped on can bottom: 'BBD JAN-2019'. Clear, straw colored body. Slight white head, fed by rising bubbles. Each sip leaves a few spots of lacing. Very slight aroma of fruity smell and toasted barley malt. Rather sweet taste. Has some bready malt and fruity hops. No skunkiness, because the beer was poured from a can. Thin mouth feel. Good carbonation. Crisp and clean, with minimal bitterness. First experienced at the Amsterdam brewery in 1975, which was in the beer hall after a brewery tour at mid morning. The servers filled the glasses as fast as one could drink, in the less than one hour session. The crowd noise increased mightily from first glass to the last. Good times. Just look at how far beer has come since then. Ridiculous.","  rDev Bottle from my father in law. Travelling all day, too tired to go out and buy real beer. I remember this being a lot crisper back in the day, now just a cheap pale lager. Adjunct grains very prevalent in aroma and taste. This used to be a treat, now just another macro.","  rDev 12 ounce can into lager glass; canned on 6/19/2017, best before 6/2018. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice pale lager. All around good robustness of pale malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful with a nice body for the ABV. Clean pils malts and mild earthy hop balance. A nicely enjoyable offering. Very well made and spot on stuff for the style.","  rDev From a 12oz can, brewed under contract by Commonwealth Brewery Ltd in Nassau, Bahamas, best by 09/18. Served in a #5 recycled plastic cup.  Pours a clear, corn oil yellow with busy carbonation and two fingers of soapy head. Retention is really rather excellent and leaves a thin, solid curtain of lacing.  Nose is sharp and malty, then vaguely like steamed white rice and grapes.  Taste starts out somewhat pleasant and well balanced if rather thin but gradually devolves into a mouldering, wet barley broth with a slick motor oil aftertaste.   Feel is slick, medium-bodied and well carbonated.  Overall, super drinkable when cold but becomes relatively nasty as it warms up. Recommend chilling to near absolute zero and then shotgunning it like the kids were doing on the beach. +0.25 for being free from the complimentary mini bar.","  rDev Poured from fridge temp. Pours a golden yellow with little carbonation. Nose is pine, slights hops, wheat, and a bit of citrus. Taste is a bit skunky, slight citrus peel, and pine. Not a lot of complexity, but certainly not bad. Feel is a bit dry, and a slight bitter aftertaste.","  rDev The most difficult part of this beer is the skunk aroma and taste. It's impossible to get past the awful taste.","  rDev What's to say? One of those ubiquitous Euro lagers. All the excitement is in their commercials. Drinkable, unoffensive, dull.

I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it  Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather  Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla  A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%  Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic.

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel. T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak. M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity. O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out.

Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present.   The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical.   The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky.   The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering  The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish.   This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!","  rDev Shared bottle, RBNAG 2011. Barrel aged 6 months, with currants added. Reddish brown colour. Intense farmhouse aroma, sour fruit, oak and spices. Sour flavour, good but not impressive.","  rDev Pours clear mahogany with purple glints and a crackly head that lasts a long while. Berries and a complex matrix of funky, tart flavours in the aroma. Lots of sourness and barnyard notes in the first sip. Pineapple juice in there too. Sweet berry notes add excellent balance but things are still bone dry overall. The 10% abv is shockingly well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with prickly, champagne like carbonation.  A stellar wild ale from the OG producer. Complex, nuanced yet still dangerously quaffable. A must try.","  rDev Consecration - 9/17/2015  Look: Pours translucent and murky medium brown. Auburn and chestnut in the light. A beige colored head that disappears with a thin ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lacing and no visible carbonation.  Smell: The aroma is floral, powdery, perfumey and musty. A lot of wood. Fresh currant, cherry and blackberry. Citrus acidity and a faint amount of some apple cider vinegar.  Taste: Sweet and sour. A hint of apple cider vinegar. Some cinnamon spice. Some berry flavored chocolate. Some pithy bitterness. The acidity level is medium for me.   Feel: Very smooth and low carbonation. Some more effervescence would help. Not sure if it’s flattened out a bit over time or not. Sweeter up front and dry on the finish.   Overall: You’d never know this beer is 10% other than feeling the alcohol. No alcohol on the aroma of taste. Definitely has some red wine similarities, but also many aspects from the mixed fermentation that you’d not expect in red wine.

Lovely and expressive red wine barrel with oak, brett, lacto, dried cherry, currant, and sour plum. Taste really does stand out, was skeptical given the hype and specifically the age of the hype, but the red wine makes this sour, playing with the oak, fruits including the addition of green apple and date, flowers, funk, brett, and lacto really well. Almost has a wine pouched cherry aftertaste with oak. Starts wet and vinous, but slowly and steadily makes its way to a drier and wood tannin laden finish, with green sour and funky textures in between, with all three phases melding into one another, best aspect of the beer. Stands the test of time, well done!","  rDev Sample at the Sour Beer fest in Boston on 6/15/2019 My notes say dark and strong.","  rDev Received from @bum4ever in a BIF box. Poured from cork and cage bottle into a teku glass. It pours a pretty ruby-orange color. The thin, ecru-colored head dissipated rapidly. On the nose there is red wine, oak, cherry, brown sugar, and Brett yeast. It's highly fragrant. As expected, it's both sweet and sour with tart cherry and currant, red wine grapes, and vinegar, tobacco and oak notes. It finishes surprisingly bitter. The flavors blend very well. It is well-carbonated and drinks below its 10% ABV. Overall, it is a highly flavorful and pleasing ale. I'm very happy to have had the chance to savor it.","  rDev 375ml bottle, that was bottled on '022218'. Amber brown colored body, with a hint of red currants. The pour resulted in a slightly organized skim of surface bubbles, but this quickly disappears. Has a partial bubble fed ring. No lacing. Aroma of currants and cherry, with a solid component of red wine oak barrel. Has a sweet and slightly funky yeast note. Taste is a tremendous combination of red wine oak barrel, the added currant fruit, and the wild nature of the yeast. Notes of tobacco and slight funk. Rather wet and juicy at the end.  Medium mouth feel, slightly tight vinous quality. Good carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer. Shares a lot of characteristics with a good Cabernet Sauvignon wine, but is more complex with the malts and yeasty funk. Also really hides the higher ABV% well.","  rDev Meager dusting of tan foam which is pretty much gone just as the pour settles, in turn no lacing to speak of but one really wasn’t expecting much of either. Light and fully transparent brownish red with wide yellow rims, while the bubbles are about as miniscule as imaginable there are steady streams of them. The sour cherry scents stunted by caramelized brown sugar and molasses notes, touch of coconut flakes, more vinegary than vinous, turns to pie dough and Ovaltine, not as high-toned as expected nor as generally powerful. Medium-bodied, has acidic punch and feels very firm in the mouth. The cherry, currant fruit flavors strong here but so is the oak. Grilled nuts, cocoa, molasses to at times more American oak dill accents. Clean attack, gets funkier towards the finish and retronasally. No astringency, dryness or deep puckering sensations, balanced and approachable. No alcoholic heat either. Even as one notes this, it bears the stamp of a wild ale, albeit mannered. The grip extends the texture a good bit after the flavors have subsided. Not discerning noticeable change as it warms towards room temperature. Suavely arrayed.","  rDev Pours a fairly clear dark red color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. Very little to no lacing. Aroma of sour dark fruits and red wine. Tart and smooth taste. Red wine and dark fruits. Very good.","  rDev Tart, slight vinegar, herbal, some currant fruitiness and dry red wine barrel, dark caramel malt","  rDev 375ml bottle  Oak forward nose with a lot of vanillins. Very vinous with a lot of cab-sauv, which the currants meld with seamlessly. Notes of cocoa and spice cake too. Taste is more spice cake forward, but with a nice layer of baryard funk and phenol too. Vinous again with a big cab sauv character. Currant tartness manifests toward the end. Big and round cab sauv feel, but with gentle carbonation too. Toasty, oaky, and nutty with cocoa blooming on the finish. Great.","  rDev Pours a ruby-burgundy with a light fog. Head formation is nearly non-existent. Aroma is grapes, currants and oak all layered over a lactic acid sourness. Very straight forward, and focused. Flavor profile is grapes, black currants, oak, toffee and toasted and nutted malts. While it starts with sweet fruit, it ends with a lactic sour twist that lingers on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth, glossy texture.

Consecration  375 ml brown glass bottle, corked and caged,  BOTTLED ON:100316  and sampled on 040718 $15.99 @ The Beer Yard (The Beverage Store), Wayne, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: This isn't the first time I've had Consecration, and it probably won't be the last, but expensive bottles are few and far between for me these days, especially when there are so many new beers out there as well. This, however, has always been a favorite for me, even within the Russian River family of beers so here goes... it's brown in color beneath a very short-lived head of off-white foam. It disappears almost immediately, but that's common for sour beers. As this was a long standing bottle all of the sediment was finely packed and remained at the base of the bottle and it's quite clear. It has some very nice ruby highlights to it. In the nose it's fruity and oaky, vinous and funky. It reminds me of a Flemish brown ale but different. The flavor follows with some added maltiness that's got some caramel to it, and a stiff bitterness. The currant is clear but not too bright, blending in with the rest of the beer so that it becomes one rounded flavor rather than pieces that aren't so finely put together. This one has it all, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus, and Lactobacillus and it shows - yet at the same time it's very refined, there must be some good blending going on in its production. It's earthy, a bit leathery, kind of grassy like wet straw, and even slightly metallic. It's not too tart or sour though, and I don't think that many would be turned away by it. Well, at least people who knew they were going to drink a sour beer, and unlike many other sour beers there is some bitterness there as well. But is that from hops or the currant? And it really is the currant that really makes this work, and what makes it stand out. I don't think I've ever had a currant beer either before or after this, and it's really unusual. It's so refreshing and livening, and although it's a little like dark cherries and black grapes it's really something different altogether. In the mouth it's medium in body and delicately effervescent and caressing. Wow, what a special beer. This is absolutely world class. Even the best Belgian sour producers would have to look at this with at least a little bit of awe. Haha, so I've reminded myself that even though it's expensive, it's really worth it. I could spend the same amount and get twice as much volume in a fairly good wine, but would it satisfy me as much? No, for me, I'm sure of that. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant, I'm not sure what else to say. Seek it out. Review# 5,933","  rDev Taster at brewery. Dark amber with small ring of head. Soft, fruity aroma, Brett. Taste is smooth and sweet, mildly tart. Subdued, but complex. This is what sours should be. Simple and clean, approachable.","  rDev This beer pours a deep purple with a minimal, quickly dissipating head. The aroma is heady and intense, with a strong acetic sour notes, as well as sour cherry jam, blackberry jam, black currant jam, with hints of fig, and graham cracker. The flavor is intense and incredibly complex, with the black currant coming through very strongly, and then a tannic burst that is enormously wine like. There is a chutney tinged, vinegar flavor to the middle, and an almost smoky finish. The mouthfeel is light with bold, bright carbonation. Overall this is an astonishing beer. Probably the best sour I have ever had.","  rDev 2014 Bottle, taster flight at Wades Wines in Westlake, CA.  Pours with almost no head, a deep burgundy color tinged with rust brown.  A subtler aroma than the 2013 Supplication, but there are a lot of red wine qualities with currants and cranberry becoming very noticeable and pairing with aromas of oak as well.  Similar to the aromas but more potent. Apple, cranberry, and oak come through for me, but overall it’s a lot of dried fruits that come together so well. Subtler hints of red wine and tobacco come through as well. An impressive 10%.  Subtle, sharp, seltzery carbonation. Thin body, tart and funky.  Arguably my favorite sour from RR. Supplication is hard to beat, but this 2014 batch of Consecratjon might take the cake.","  A gorgeous reddish brown beer with a quickly fading head. No lacing but a constant patch of bubbles float on the surface above the nucleation site. The aroma is a medley of oak, red wine, vanilla, tart cherries and a hint of chocolate. The taste is woody, sweet, and vinous. There are also cherries, vanilla and chocolate in the taste. This is just outstanding.","  rDev Pours dark rich amber brown with quickly dissipating head. The aroma is red wine, woodiness from the barrel, vinegar, dark berries and some cherry juice.  The flavor follows the nose, it's super juicy. Tons of berry and red wine flavors. It's nice and tart with a slight funkiness. It's delicious. I would seek this out, it's a very good sour, and I'm normally not a fan of high abv sours."]},{"Name":"Corona Extra","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/75/232/","Brewery":"Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V.","Style":"Lager - Adjunct","Alcohol":4.60,"Score":57.0,"Comments":["  rDev If you aren't on a beach, just say no.","  rDev Aroma is sweet, corn, some malts.  Color is pale yellow with a short-lived white head with little/no lacing. Ample carbonation.  Taste has a bit of sulfur, sweet corn, with little or no hops making themselves known. No bittering. The finish is smooth and slightly sweet, with a thin presence.  The body is thin.  Overall, a refreshing pounder that is no better than a much cheaper American-brewed adjunct lager. People paying a premium are either doing it for the image or are getting ripped off.","  rDev 12 oz. clear bottle with a BB of Oct 2021 (sampled May 2021).  Appearance: Clear pale straw body, no head.  Aroma: Mild malt sweetness, corn, and a fair bit of skunk.  Taste: Same as it smells, mild yeasty note, classic lager profile.  Mouthfeel: Medium low body, medium high carbonation, clean finish.  Overall: It's Corona! Pretty classic adjunct lager brew, not much flavor, not much expected. A squeeze of lime and it's easy drinking. About as far from Craft Beer as you can get, so I understand the low scores, but there is nothing wrong here. Pretty perfect for a Cinco De Mayo or a day on the beach or in the hot sun. Not anything I'm going to pick over a craft beer, but I'm not going to turn my nose up at one. Neither should you.","  rDev March 2002:  Over-priced beer with a silly lime-slice gimmick to attract stock-broker wannabes and other idiots. Pass.  Well, I know some quite respectable ladies who actually like this, and I try not to harrass them for it. Personally I avoid it, with or without the lime wedge.","  rDev A 7 oz. bottle of this has been sitting in my Dad's refrigerator for two years. Obviously, no one is interested, so I'll make some room in the box. For what I understand, the duration won't augment nor detract from its original taste. Poured into a pint glass to maximize its qualities, it shows a very light and crystal clear amber color. There's no head nor lacing. If your nose tries real hard, well into the glass, it may detect a faint hint of common beer. It drinks like a beer seltzer with more stimulation from the carbonation than any flavor. There's no other description other than nearly tasteless.","  rDev Bottle no discernible date.  Clear gold, with very quickly-dissipating white head, that leaves a thin ring, briefly.   Smell is light skunk when first poured, to the tiniest bit of grain smell, after the head is gone. I can tell that it's not water, but not by much. A plain sheet of paper, that's been sitting out for three or four days (not fresh, or distinct) , is as close as I can approximate it.   Taste is light bread crust, with a barest hint of sweetness. Not much there, but it's inoffensive. Guessing that's the appeal? A tiny bit of the initial skunk makes a brief appearance at finish, but thankfully doesn't linger. Slight bitterness at finish, that lingers briefly. That at least is some sort of gustatory sensation, so adds slightly more than the almost-nothing , that this beer otherwise generates.   Feel is light, with moderate, soft carbonation that leaves a light pleasant tingle after finish.   Overall, other than the fact that this was cool &amp; wet, on a hot summer day, this beer was a waste of time, brain cells, &amp; calories. It did serve as a reminder of why I haven't had it in a long time, so there is that. ;)  ps : A burp brings the skunk back up , as a bonus, internal review . :P","  rDev Sparkling clear gold with a short white blanket settling to a thin ring.  Spicy notes of metallic skunk and resin immediately hit the nose and palate--which is typically what the lime is there to counteract, (however, to clarify, I'm having this lime-less this time for the sake of an actual review)--but that quickly recedes to a breadier, softer corn note.  The body is surprisingly full and fluffy compared to how I typically feel it is, (also probably affected by the lime, but as opposed to the positive effect on the flavor, the lime would negatively affect the body), finishing semi-dry with a touch of grass.","  rDev The first time I ever had a Corona was in Mexico, 1983 I think. It came in a square case. i.e. 20 bottles in a case, $4 for the case, $1 deposit. The beer introduced in The USA a year or two later was a completely different beer. Today, light yellow, light smell, light in taste, light feel, overall, light. I'd say drink ANY other Mexican beer.","  rDev Pours a lightly foggy golden wheat with a finger of white foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is dank, resin, grassy hops and bready, wafery, crackery malts. Flavor profile is the same - crisp dank, resin, grassy hops with bready, wafery and crackery malts. Dankness is sharp and huge. Mouth feel crisp with a medium-thin consistency. It's a little prickly sharp. Overall, sharp and crisp, but the dankness cuts through everything.   Served in a plastic cup from a bottle.","  rDev L:. Pours a straw yellow, with a small fizzy head and a few specks of lacing.  S:. Mostly grain and corn with a strong skunkiness.  T:. Mostly grain and corn, a strong skunkiness.  F:. Light and crisp.  O:. Without a lime in it there are very few redeeming qualities to this beer.","  rDev 330ml clear glass bottle. L: Clear, yellow with almost no head, just a thin ring, and no lacing. No visible carbonation. S: Grainy, not much else. T: Very sweet, no hop flavours, lots of corn &amp; rice, zero bitterness.  F: Soft carbonation and some stickiness. O: Generic, cheap, mass-produced Mexican lager. As a beer, it’s terrible. The obligatory sliver of lime offers an improvement.","  rDev L: Crystal clear amber color, no head, no lacing, good carbonation.  S: Sweet.  T: A watery pale ale. Some malts, some hops.  F: Light bodied, not much going on.  T: A drinkable beer when all is bad. Not a reason to buy it but you could survive it...","  rDev I can’t believe I have never reviewed this brew. I have had it many times after I started reviewing beers, but never reviewed this one. It has never been my favorite, but it is a very popular and easy drinking brew well worth an adequate review. So here it goes…. Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Appearance – The beer pours a light golden color with a tiny fizzy white head of foam. The head fades superfast to leave almost no lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is light overall with some smells of grain and a bit of sweet corn and caramel. There is a little bit of lime and a hint of herb as well. Taste – The taste begins with a slightly grainy and caramel taste mixed with a little bit of corn and herb. There is a little bit of a skunky flavor in there as well, likely due to the use of clear bottles. As the flavor advances some light lime and lemon citrus and a little bit of hay come to the tongue to leave one with a moderately crisp and grainy taste mixed with some lightly sweetened and somewhat off flavors to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body fo the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is average. For the style a little bit of a higher carbonation level would have been slightly more refreshing, but overall the feel is good and creates an easy drinking brew. Overall – Like I said prior, this was never one of my favorites. I never discriminate against “big” non-craft brews (just see my other reviews) as I think in some ways they have access to ingredients and equipment that many small breweries don’t, but this is one brew I have never really loved and, while I am sure I will drink it at some occasion again (like Cinco De Mayo) I don’t recommend per se.","  rDev L: -pours a clear light golden with a small,foamy,white head -medium to high carbonation visible S: -huge skunk,popcorn, lemon,lime T: -sweet corn,lemon,lime,a hint of hop bitterniss and absolutely no finish F: -medium to high carbonation -light body O: I see why they recommend to drink this with a slice of lime, it corresponds well with the skunk. This is a good bit below some of the boring, but drinkable american Lagers i had like MGD. Also why go through the lengths of all the adjuncts and edibles to ensure the Beer staying stable and clear and then making that for naught by putting it in a clear bottle?","  rDev From notes 12/9/11: Pours a clear yellow straw producing 2 fingers of shortlived, white head which leaves little lace as it recedes. Aroma is corn, grain, lemon and grass. Taste is corn, lager yeast, thin lemon, grass and honey with more alcohol presence than expected from a 4.6 ABV, Mouthfeel is light-moderate bodied with moderate carbonation; watery and thin. Best suited to be paired with food or when mowing grass.","  rDev Ok, I know this is a screwy rating, but I have my reasons. I was served the reviewed Corona in a dive blues bar (complete with lime wedge at the top of the bottle) having a great time and the beer just seemed so right for the occasion. Hence my 4 for overall to reflect the beer’s appropriateness for the experience. It went well with the beef brisket sandwiches being served “on the patio”.","  rDev I've made five trips to Mexico over the years, and I've never thought much of the cerveza (but obviously I love the country and the people). I have a really cool Corona t-shirt I bought in Mazatlán, so I suppose I should review the beer. It is incorrectly slammed by a lot of reviewers, but remember, you are comparing it to Budweiser, not your local AIPA.  It pours clear yellow with very little head. A nice finishing hops aroma hits you at first but for some reason it dissipates. The taste is clean sweet and thin, what you expect for the style. The finish is very refreshing.   Recommended, if you are looking for an American style beer for your guests, or you are in Mexico and don't have a lot of options (washes down tequila just fine).","  rDev 24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 9/30/2017. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit too lemon/pear fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery finish. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful for the ABV. Clean pale malt/grains and solid earthy hop balance for the style. Nice barley presence, and not overdone on adjuncts. An enjoyable and well made offering.","  rDev Just slightly better than the Corona Light, a little more flavor and body (but not much more). Same light yellow color, mild head, fairly high carbonation. Tastes of fruit and grain, and improved significantly when consumed with a lime slice. Crisp finish although slightly sour aftertaste. Good for days at the beach/pool or with spicy Mexican food.","  rDev compared to its peers, this aint bad. not sure how its taken me until now to review it, ive had hundreds of these if not more in my life, but a vacation to sunny florida now might skew this one a little bit favorably. feet in the sand, fresh cut lime wedged into the can, and a long drag of this yields instant refreshment, less chemical and metallic weirdness and cheapness than i remember, and rushing carbonation and finishing dryness let it fade at a good pace. its one of the few beers out there that i think is enhanced nicely by the lime, its a little dreary without it, but a little of that green zesty acidity and we are in business. perhaps only a pacifico demands a lime more than this one. it warms up pretty poorly, with some of the adjunct elements diminishing what i liked about it when it was ice cold, which is its cleanness and quickness. i taste no hops, no lager yeast at all, and very little malt, its just yellow water, but its still better than some other yellow waters, and in a beachside context, this will probably always have some value. i drank a few ipas before this one that just didnt take me where this one did. im sure ill have a few of these each year in a warm climate, and im actually very thankful for that...  edit: the new cans are an easy, affordable, and inoffensive shotgun option, if anyone is curious..."]},{"Name":"Flower Power","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/651/6076/","Brewery":"Ithaca Beer Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.20,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev Review 1554  My continuation for beers I usually would not consume.

From the bottle: Nada. I am not a fan of their no longer putting the ABV on the labels. I dig the minimalist look of the new labels, but less is not always more.   I find it VERY hard to believe that I have not previously reviewed Flower Power IPA, but since no review exists, I must press on. I know that I had a bottle for a Bro. Woody Knows Beer piece about a local florist, but this bottle is fresh from the FGBS here in town, so maybe something funny happened on the way to the Forum. SMH.

Even so, I have become skittish &amp; once I Pop!ped off the cap, I gave it a gentle pour followed by a vigorous in-glass swirl. This action raised two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head that slowly fell back down. leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was an oh-so-slightly-hazy Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7), but it seemed to be clarifying as it warmed, leading me to wonder if it might not be a chill haze. Nose had a tropical fruitiness, like mango, papaya and pineapple. Hmmm. Mouthfeel was medium, but very soft, especially for the style. Usually, these AIPAs attack my tongue like Gangbusters coming through the door, but not in this case. The taste was deeply of pineapple, but underlain by a light grapefruit bitterness and a bready malt flavor. I thought of pineapple upside-down cake as I was drinking it! Yum.

Brewed in the style of an India Pale Ale, year round release from Ithaca Beer Company, available in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a tulip glass.  (Appearance) Pours a billowing foamy off-white head over a very mildly hazy amber body with fine sediment in tow. Retention is very good and lacing is light and patchy. 4.5  (Smell) Gentle but aromatic blend of citrusy, tropical and floral hop notes in the aroma, with hints of grapefruit (sans acidity), mango and pineapple. Undertones of pale crystal malt generates just enough malt body to give this beer a delicate balance, although the hops prevail by a slight margin with a moderate bitterness. Potency is moderate. 4.25  (Taste) Hop-generated notes of mango, pineapple and sweetened citrus with a gentle crystal malt sweetness that continues to give the hop presence a lead. Light and drinkable in body with a lot of unique hop flavor, while remaining relatively mild in hop bitterness and malt sweetness. 4  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, smooth, lightly dry. Carbonation is mild, generating a light frothiness and a modestly crisp finish. Body is shy of medium for the style, light/medium overall. Balance is nearly even hoppy bitter to sweet. Alcohol presence is low and there are no off characters. 4  (Overall) A very enjoyable India Pale Ale with a unique array of tropical fruit and less acidic citrus hop qualities makes for a refreshing drinking experience. The lightness of the body, balance of hop and malt characteristics and more gentle hop bitterness places this beer for me on the border between American IPA and  hoppy  Pale Ale, although this is a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer, and you should never stop at just one. Why I picked up a single bottle, I may never know.

Appreciate the hop mouthfeel and the ability to hide alcohol at the high end strength wise for an ipa. Citrus and pine. Stayed floral. One of the first well made East Coast ipas.  EDIT: Had it again on tap at the source in Ithaca. Was pretty good and consistent. Since the original review, plenty of amazing ipas have comes out, so I understand how the scores would slightly dip having this 10 years later even though its fresher than when these were first being thrown in as extras and stuff.   3.5/3.75/4/4/3.75 was the on tap score Oct 2019. Score was all 4's before that. Gonna readjust here.","  rDev Pours a nice golden orange color slight hazed, smell is all tropical, taste has pineapple and citrus hops with sweet malts in the finish, smooth delicious easy to drink , with medium carbonation, this would be a staple ipa in my fridge if i had access to it.","  rDev Amber in color with a fingernail of bright white on top. Heavy lacing is present. The aroma is fairly straightforward with plenty of citrus hops. The taste is aggressively filled with citrus hops with a nice light malt backbone to keep things from being out of hand. The mouth is very crisp and refreshing.","  rDev Bottle into a snifter.  3.5 A: Moderately hazed medium orange color with granular particles in suspension. Two fingers of creamy white head. Retention is about average and a finger ring of lacing is left.  3.75 S: Rich maltiness with plenty of peachy fruitiness. Floral, resiny, and citrusy hops. Caramel malts to round it out.  4.0 T: Hops per above with peachy, orange, and pineapple citrus. Again strong neutral maltiness with caramel notes and light toffee.  4.0 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Pleasantly creamy and super smooth.  4.25 D: Good mix of hops and malts. Great beer overall."]},{"Name":"Old Chub","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2681/14712/","Brewery":"Oskar Blues Grill & Brew","Style":"Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy","Alcohol":8.00,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 mL can from the LCBO; dated Aug 14 2020 and served barely chilled. This is the last of a 4-pack that I bought in late 2020.  Pours a muddied brownish-amber colour, with a deliberately rough pour producing half an inch of foamy beige head. It leaves behind a thin collar, but little else worth mentioning - though a good swirl does leave some spotty lacing and legs behind. Mostly just sweet on the nose - lots of caramel and toffee, with notes of cherry red licorice candy, dates and figs; these obscure subtler suggestions of toasted bread, molasses, plum and alcohol.  A fine beer, indeed - complex and flavourful, though the scales are certainly tipped toward the 'malt' side of the equation, with an almost fruit cake-like flavour at the forefront. There's caramel, toffee, toasted bread and molasses, as well as cherry, prune, date and fig; hints of cocoa and smoked malt at the finish, leading in to a slightly warming aftertaste with lingering hints of toffee, earthiness and dark fruits, as well as a touch of booziness. Medium in body, with relatively low carbonation levels that weakly brush against the surface of the tongue; feels smooth and a little slick on the palate. If you've got more than one can, you might want to pace yourself - it's easy to pour down the hatch, but as Samuel Jackson once said, it'll get'cha drunk.  Final Grade: 4.2, an awesome A-. Old Chub has been on my wants list for a couple years, and I'm thrilled to strike it off. I don't know if this is the best scotch ale I've ever had - it's tasty for sure, with a varied array of flavours, and the 8% is exceedingly well-integrated. That being said, the smoked malt aspects are fairly subtle, and overall it's a little sweet for my tastes - minor flaws for this style, of course, if they can even be considered flaws in the first place. If you see this beer and are in any way curious, do not hesitate to purchase it - I'll be doing so again at the first opportunity.","  rDev Pours deep mahogany with amber glints and a small toffee colored head. Huge raisin, caramel, stewed fruit notes in the nose. The taste is intensely malty with roasty notes mixed with berry and fruity notes. Leafy, woody hops in the back. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Cherry, chocolate and roasted barley notes in the finish.  A nice Wee Heavy. Very malty and complex. A must try if you like malty beers.","  rDev On tap at Das Beer Garden. Deep brown. Smells of toffee and caramel. Light butterscotch notes. Tastes of toasty malts, hop bitterness, then toffee and faint hints of butterscotch. Medium heavy. Hoppy enough to barely taste like a wee heavy. Mostly tastes like a big, sweet brown ale, but hints of the scotch ale come back in the back end.","  rDev 355 ml can served cold into a chalice. LCBO purchase for about $3.35 CDN per can.  Appearance - Clear dark mahogany color. A finger plus of long lasting light tan head. Great spidery lacing.  Smell - Rich and malty, lots of bready, hints of caramel and molasses and subtle bits of smoke and peat. Very balanced and quite aromatic.  Taste - Just like the nose. Starts quite bready and rich with bits of toffee and caramel mixed in. Some bitterness arrives before transitioning to a smoky backdrop. Finishes with smoke and rich doughy bread.  Mouthfeel - Medium body, a bit sticky, light carbonation and hides the 8% ABV quite nicely.  Overall - Excellent Scotch Ale, one of the finest in the style. A beer that has long been sought after, Old Chub delivered in spades. Well worth the price of tasting.","  rDev Canned 6/18/20  I was in the mood for something sweet tonight, and a blind grab into the fridge found this. I've had it around for a little bit and forgot about it but tonight's the night  Pours an opaque murky brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  Sweet on the aroma, but still balanced. Lots of caramel malt, dates, apricot, and vanilla, but balanced out by dark bread and a touch of earthy hops  The front end of the sip has an understated dark fruit, bready malt, and whiskey flavor, not really all that much happening. The swallow however is where this thing comes to life, with notes of sweet bourbon, dry toffee, vanilla, dates, and cinnamon  A thick full body combines with moderate carbonation for a slow sipping beer. A touch of alcoholic tingle dries this up a bit, but still finishes somewhere between dry and sticky  This was good, but not quite as remarkable as I expected. Regardless, it filled the sweet tooth for tonight while also providing a balanced drinking experience","  rDev A 12 fl. oz. can, canned on 10th May 2019 ‘eyes up here’. Poured into a snifter glass.  Appearance: A dark amber copper colour with a one finger beige head that dissipated fairly quickly but left lots of nice spotty lacing.  Aroma: Sweet, caramel malt, dark stone fruit, plum, cherry, cherry coke and pine.  Taste: Light sweetness, light roast, chocolate malt, caramel, coffee, with a hint of smoke and dark stone fruit.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with soft carbonation.  Overall: I like the aroma, but flavour while not bad, didn’t quite match my expectation after that initial whiff.","  rDev Plaid can, canned 5/1/20. Thanks Lee for this one!  Dark brownish black, glowing dark russet/garnet tones in the light. Thin cap of tan foam, minimal spotty lace.  Aroma is malty and lightly sweet, hints of molasses and dark fruit.  Sweet and slightly astringent, dark bread crusts, raisin, and molasses, slightly drying alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied, carbonated to be sure. Overall it’s a pretty standard issue Scotch Ale, that could use a little more complexity.","  rDev A blackish dark brown pour leaves no head, nor does the glass witness any lacing. Be not alarmed. There's some delightful carbonation here that adds to the enjoyment of consuming one of these. A very rich roasted malt aroma takes the mind off the missing head. The taste is full, rich and somewhat complex, with roasted malts presiding over a mild hop appearance. An outstanding mouth feel for a beverage that rings in with a 8% ABV. Since McEwan's is no longer available to me, this'll do.","  rDev 12 oz can pours a dark reddish-brown in color, has a nice creamy off white head that leaves a clingy lacing in my glass. Has a sweet fruity, malty aroma. Nice sweet fruity, caramel flavors balanced with a lot a decent amount of hops, nice sweetness in the finish. Medium body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel, pretty damn good.","  rDev Can 8/2019: Deep garnet brown with a rusty-tinged beige head. Creamy cap provides copious strands and spots of lacing.  Nose is malty, leathery/earthy, lightly fruity. The taste reveals a dark cherry to dig-like aspect to the fruit. It’s a lot more earthy though in a leather and tobacco way. These flavors keep this dark toffee to charred caramel malty beer from being very sweet overall, though the opening note has some vague aspects of a sweet red wine.  Overall, this is more balanced than many Scotch ales I’ve had - in a manner similar to American barleywines being more bitter than the English version. It has enough malt power and light tobacco earthiness to stay within style, though.","  rDev Canned 4/25/14; drank 8/4/14 @ the Yarchives.   Brown/orange murkiness.   Big tan head; strong lace.   Caramel &amp; orange zest nose.   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Mild caramel &amp; mild orange zest flavors; fairly light &amp; sessionable for the style, but missing that big kick I look for.   More of a Scottish ale, perhaps?","  rDev Canned a few months ago, and poured from fridge temp in Idaho Falls! Pours very dark brown with generous light brown head. Nose is interesting - initially picking up some metallic notes, followed by some burnt toffee, spice, molasses, and some dark fruit. Taste is really smooth. Toffee, candy, cherries, charred wood, leather, and tobacco. A really nice scotch ale. Mouthfeel is creamy.","  rDev ** 02/18/2019  Can to snifter.

The nose has loads of caramel and a healthy dollop of stone fruit. Wow.  A quick draw rewards you with a beer that has substance, with the caramel and stone fruit combining to yield a beer that is the picture in the dictionary when you look up “scotch ale.” A pleasure to drink.","  rDev Dark brown / ruby with tight, creamy head. Aroma of malt, wood, peat. Taste is more dark malt, overall very smooth, some smoky and bitter on the palate. Nicely done.","  rDev I had this Scotch Ale at a small pub and I was impressed by the Nitro looking smooth head and the smooth flavor.  Look: the color is brown with a thick smooth cream colored head  Aroma: slightly boozy, sweet, roasted malts   Taste: The flavor is roasted malts and sweet caramel, some coffee, a bit smokey, maybe a tad of bourbon but not much.  Feel: medium body, oily","  rDev This beer is similar to their imperial red ale. Pours a brown color. Good clarity for something brown. A light tan head is produced, above average in size, that 3/4  mark I would say. Aroma of peat, chesnuts, bog, brown malt and a little bit of alcohol. Reminiscient of a winter warmer but heartier.   Taste drops substantial roasted malt (not scorched, but rather, smoked) with campfire notes. Those into the varied nuance of different smoked malts would dig this. Thought it was a little more bitter and the alcohol was a little strong in the mouth feel on this one. Carbonation is a little lower and appropriate for style. Toffee presence pushes through. The heavier than usual bitterness starts to evoke some darker fruit notions. Its a decent representation of style for those into this sort of thing, but I'd rather stick with their hoppier offerings.","  rDev 12oz draft poured into a tulip shows a murky, reddish brown body that briefly floats a 1/4in cream colored head that returns with agitation. Artistic webbed lacing remains behind.  Aroma is oddly boozy over the malty goodness with barely a hint of toffee.  Flavor is more toffee forward.  Mouthfeel is an oily, mouth filling medium but the finish is absent. It just disappears past the tongue.  Overall a fine scotch ale from a consistently successful brewery.","  rDev Tasted from 12 oz can.  L - Dark brown color with a little mahogany. Opaque in the glass, although it appears clear around the edges. Thin but persistent sheet of gray-brown bubbles and lace.  S - Aromas of coffee, low burnt wood and smoke. Clean and sparse, with a hint of alcohol on the nose.  T - Malt flavors with roasted, coffee-like notes dominating. Chocolate in the mid-palate, along with some faint, fresh, lightly floral hops. Smoke in the dry finish along with some alcohol sweetness.  F - Medium to heavy body and barely perceptible carbonation (appropriate). Low to medium hops bitterness. Light alcohol presence for the 8% ABV.  O - Beer is clean, malt-focused and surprisingly complex without being sweet or cloying. For me it hits all the right notes for a Scotch ale.","  rDev From 32 Great Power. In Teku glass. Watching Broken Mirrror 2x01. With pok cheese. Typical scotch ale well executed. Toffee with a bit of booze and smoke. However, nothing bothering, instead providing it some character.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz CAN into a pub glass.  Pours dark translucent brown with garnet highlights. A fine three finger foamy head with plenty of staying power.   Sweet malts are very forward on the nose with aromas of diacetyl and spice. Just a hint of nutmeg and ginger in the background.  The flavors are straightforward and follow the nose down the middle. Sweet butterscotch/carmel malts, with a moderate but not to heavy-handed dose of toast and smoke. Very little hop presence but it's welcome and could even be a bit more potent. It isn't complex but it's still tasty.  The mouthfeel is medium and borders on sticky. Just a touch more carbonation and hops would make this one better.  Overall this is a damn solid wee-heavy and one of the best beers out of a can I've ever had. It isn't awe-inspiring for the style but it checks every box across the board. I'm going to get me some more and you should too.","  rDev Oskar Blues rarely disappoints and Old Chub is one that most certainly did not...  Like most other Scott Ale's this one was beautifully dark, had a nice tan head and it stuck around for most of the glass. The smell was a sweet mixture of whiskey, some spice and malt and just a tad of hops. Though it started out very carbonated, much more for my taste, it tamped down as it got warmer allowing the full, rich Scottish ale taste with just enough of some hops to create a complex but smooth brew to imbibe. Overall, this is truly a solid if not great beer. I've had a few of these already and I think it's now officially on my  Go-To  list when looking for great beers to try again on my own or share with good friends.","  rDev 12oz canned 1/26/17 poured into a mug at fridge temp 8.0% ABV. The beer is dark brown with a light brown head. The head fades to a cap after a few minutes with just a little lacing. The aroma is all rich malt and a hint of smoke. The flavor starts with dense smokey sweetness and stays there. It is neither bitter or cloying. Mouthfeel is full, rich and soft with a wet, but pleasant finish. Overall, very good. This is a great example of the style. Recommended","  rDev CAN Viscous dark chestnut with creamy pocked beige head. 4 Kola nut, tree bark, and black cherry skins. 4 Brown soda loaf, walnuts, fresh figs, earth, birch beer, hint of bacon, some leafy hops and cleansing minty bitterness. Buttered rum as it opens. 4 Just medium, fizzy, a bit hot. 3.75  Chewy and autumnal and all that. Ever so slightly thin, light on the dark fruit and too hopped to be right on style. Didn’t catch the smoke until I knew to look for it. Lovely sipper, and I’m glad there’s a non-IPA, non-stout of this quality widely available in cans. But doesn’t hit the heights of Dirty Bastard, never mind Traquair. 4","  rDev Pours a dark brown almost black color. Thick frothy tan head dissipates slowly leaving sticky tan lacing on the glass with a residual head.   Smell is very malty with roasted malts, some dark fruits, and smokey peat notes.   Taste has lots of smoke up front, almost a hint of smoked bacon, some peaty notes rich roasted malts and bark brown bread. Not super sweet, but its got some molasses and brown sugar in there.   Feel is actually quite full. Medium carbonation. Rich, hearty and filling.  Overall a really nice wee heavy. Outstanding beer at a great price.

I crawled into the depths of my cellar and pulled this five-year-old beer out. I removed the black plastic off the cap. I hesitated and then carefully cracked opened the bottle. I waited in anticipation for the hiss. Gradually, I pried the cap off, a majestic hiss released along with a heavenly smell. The beer is 56 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer produced two-finger head. The head retention was short-lived but satisfying. The murky brown substance falls around SRM 22. The beer had a mahogany hue.

Plum highlights glow in a crisp, clear way from an Offero oversized wine glass. A thin, fine, chestnut head lasts a couple of minutes before becoming a veil and a ring. Spotty lace washes up and down as a film clings but never seems to settle.  Rich and earthy raisins are punctuated by short bursts of brown sugar. Pumpernickle bread and leather give this an aroma of what I imagine a 19th Century English drawing room might smell like.  The sweet/bitter balance is tilted towards the sweetness with occasional spikes in bitterness. It generally follows the aroma with added notes of coal. The alcohol presents similar to whiskey, though very subtle. The finish is long and sweet. Warmth brings out a strong sense of licorice.  The body is full and velvety. Alcohol is well controlled, but still strong given that it is 12%. The carbonation is fine. A late hint of alcohol burn adds a nice texture. Unsurprisingly, there is a great deal of residual sugar.  This is less sweet than other British Barleywines. It is also much more earthy. I will hold the second bottle for the Autumn, but this one was very tasty on a hot, early June afternoon. Unquestionably, this is better served at a higher temperature. Both bottles are vintage release 2019.","  rDev Dark brown filtered, with moderate carbonation and 1.5 fingers of yellowish beige head.

The label also claims  11.3% ALC./VOL.   Appearance: The body is a very dark mahogany brown with good clarity and hints of very dark brown and reddish-brown at the edges as light comes through. The head is a light off-khaki color with a hint of tobacco stained yellow. There isn't much head retention and it fades quickly to a ring and a raft.  Aroma: The beer has a lot of caramel aroma which pushes through and is joined by a bit of wet wood. There is some alcohol that comes through. Oddly it smells a bit cheesy but the alcohol and wood characters come through a bit stronger.  Taste: Buttery caramel floods the palate like velvety gravy. There are notes of wood, nutmeg, and cinnamon in the back of the palate and in retronasal character.  Mouthfeel: It is so smooth and wonderful. It gives the blood a bit of a sugar rush which indicates a slightly incomplete fermentation, and this plays out a bit in the stickiness of the beer. It isn't quite on the mark.  Overall: Each worthwhile Barleywine is its own creation and has its own character. This one is spicy with a bit of wood and a gentle thick smoothness lined by a mixture of alcoholic and grain sweetness. This is certainly a Barleywine for those with a stronger sweet tooth, as it feels under-attenuated. I personally wouldn't pick it over other Barleywines that are available but I would be willing to try another beer from another year to see how it compares.","  rDev Beer dinner at Ron’s Corner Tavern and it’s the king of the hill.

Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Slightly hazed mahogany pour with 1 finger of fizzy white head. Nice ring of lacing.  S: Caramel and toffee.. sweet and boozy.   T/F: Sweet and boozy, just like it smells. Brown sugar, caramel, and molasses. Toffee and candi sugar. Modest residual hop flavor, which has largely aged off. Some notes of vanilla underneath. Full bodied and smooth... sticky on the tongue and warming.   O: A big boozy beast of a Barleywine... dangerously drinkable, and this bottle may have been past its prime but held up damned well at 8 years. Would love to snag a newer one for a side-by-side. One to seek out.","  rDev 2013. Poured with rich, full head that slowly dissipated. Mild to medium toffee, brown sugar nose with some BA noticeable. Taste is incredibly mellow and well-balanced. Unlike Bigfoot, I don't know if I'd age this any longer - although I am comparing a BA version to a non BA. Mouthfeel is amazing with creamy body. Very good beer but I was hoping for a little bit more edginess in the taste and feel. Not a knock for an amazingly mellow beer. A bit of residual sweetness in the finish.","  rDev 12oz 2018 vintage bottle (aged about one year at 55F) poured into a becher glass at fridge temp 12.5% ABV 31 IBU per label. The beer pours dense medium brown in color with quickly fading, cola like light brown head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is nice with a mix of oak, vanilla, bourbon and brown sugar. The taste is semisweet caramel (burnt sugar), oak, vanilla, tame bourbon and a touch of alcohol (in a pleasant way). The finish is amazingly mostly dry due to the combination of subtle bitterness, and barrel notes. The balance and feel here are world class. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and features less than medium carbonation. Overall, excellent. I was hesitant to pay the price on this one, but it's exceptional. Not too sweet, not too boozy just well crafted all the way around.","  rDev Snagged a 12oz bottle of the 2018 vintage today ($12.00) at The Beer Store in Nashua... digging in while watching some football...  Poured all into a Smutty snifter.... It's a clear but very dark mahogany color; almost has some ruby/garnet... Head is fine, tan and quite thin, though lacing is OK... Aroma shows off the bourbon, along with some caramel, brown sugar and dark cherry. Body is medium-plus, and it is quite smooth overall.  Flavor also has caramel/toffee notes, and some caramelized brown sugar sweetness. Has some raisin and date action lurking in the background, like in boozy fruit-cake. The bourbon is present and easily detectable yet restrained, never in yo' face. Very much in the English barleywine mold, and quite warming at that. Pretty good, though a bit pricey for the value, imo... Prosit!  4.24/5 rDev -6.2% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25  2048","  rDev 2015 bottle","  rDev Very nice beer!  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful dark reddish brown with a nice beige head and curtain lacing. Vanilla and caramel smell and taste. This beer has a nice lightness to it not usually associated with a barleywine. Just a hint of booziness. Enjoyed it with smoked ribs.","  rDev 2015 vintage, No. 005. 13.3% ABV. 42.0 IBU British Ale Yeast 3500 produced.  Pours a deep crimson brown [Dark Ruby categorization], murky and intimidating. An ivory head of thin foam bubbles up to about a finger and then fizzles out quickly. An island of foam sits on top of the beer, with spots of lacing around the inside of the glass.  A lot of people have likened the nose on this beer to fruit cake, and I couldn’t agree more. Candied dark fruits, caramel, toffee, and sweet, bready malts. Lightly boozy, subtle tones of molasses and oak, but overall very smooth and predominantly sweet.  Rich, sweet flavors characterized by more of that toffee and caramel, as well as an inviting vanilla component. Complimented well by oak and bourbon, the balance on this beer is incredible. It still has that malt backbone that a good Barleywine should have, but it’s not overpowering in any way. As it warms, a surprising hop presence also clearly emerges, adding further complexity to the flavor profile.  Smooth as hell, with a retained carbonation that’s soft but noticeable. Warming and not overly boozy, this beer finishes with the subtlest punch.","  rDev Serving: Bottle Bottled: 2018   A: Pours a ruby-tinged dark mohagany with a finger of beige head. Decent retention for the ABV; early nightsky lacing. (4)  S: Fruit cake. Caramel, dried berries, toasted brown bread, toffee, a whiff of hops. (4.5)  T: Rich, thick toffee flavor. Starts a touch harder with a toasty hop bite flavor that melts into rich creamy caramel and toffee tones, white chocolate,and a pleasantly boozy finish. (4.5)  M: Full body with medium carbonation and a warming, slow finish. (4.25)  O: Wow. This is a tasty damn beer. It pours dark and just on the edge of opaque with a cute little head. The aroma and flavor both hint at harshness and delivering velvety malty sweetness. There is some fruity, spice cake aroma to it, but the flavor is completely toffee and nuts with some background spice and warming alcohol. Lovely to drink. This is one worth seeking out if you're like me and don't usually come across it.

Look and feel is pilsner and acceptable within the style. But, all I taste from this beer is grassy hops. To call it a German pilsner, this falls short by Victory. They need to sample Warsteiner, Wernesgruner, Spatan, Bitburger, Paulaner, Kulmbacher, etc. Mexico made Bohemia Pilsner is a far better German pilsner than Victory Pils. That said, it is a decent American pilsner if you are looking to scratch that itch.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.3%. Clear golden colour, moderate to low white head. Nice aroma of floral, grassy and herbal hops, some sweetish malts in the background. Medium sweet and malty flavour, followed by distinct herbal hops. A good pilsener indeed, but some European ones are better.","  rDev Single bottle from Party Town Clear pale gold with a nice fluffy head. Good retention. Great pilsner.","  rDev Enjoy by 08 March 2020. I believe this is a 5 month enjoy by date so was likely canned ~08 Oct. Pours yellow straw colored &amp; translucent. Plenty of lacing remaining throughout. Aroma of mostly grains and some biscuit. Taste follows aroma with addition of resiny, herbal flavor. Slight hoppiness in the finish. Flavor is quite clean. Mouthfeel seems medium and a slight crispness. Completely dry with some heft to it. I've been meaning to have tried this for a long time but it seems to be languishing on shelves when I've come across it. Saw a fresh pack and picked it up. Solid pilsner brewed in the US of A. Will assuredly be revisiting this in the future.","  rDev Medium carbonation with about medium body as well Aroma is lemon,lemon peel upfront and strong.

Grass in the nose. The mouth gets a nice pilsner-like bitterness, ending very well overall. Yum!","  rDev Light clear gold color with world class white cap and lacing.  Aroma of rich malt and herbal, floral, spicy hops.  Taste is a bit hop forward with rich malt quickly following. The hops posses an herbal aspect that's a little more pronounced than I usually get with a Pils style which I suppose is an American brewing touch. Otherwise the hops are bright, spicy and have that firm hoppiness often found in European Pilsners. Malt remains like a percussion instrument providing a bass line while hops sing merrily along.  Medium texture with balancing carbonation.  I was looking forward to trying this one and was certainly not disappointed. Remarkably good and I'll look for it again.","  rDev 'Enjoy by 13 FEB 2019' I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this beer yet! I don't drink it often but it's one of those classic beers from an OG in the craft beer scene. Is it a coincidence that I'm reviewing this now while the scene moves in favor of lighter, more flavorful lagers? Mayyyybe. It's just a solid, reliable, traditional Pilsner with a slight American twist with the addition of a tame but noticeably floral hop profile. Delicious!  And how fitting, one of the classics and first true craft beers I drank over a decade ago serves as my 900th BA review!","  rDev De Craftbeer-shop.com. En copa Teku. Jugando a Avernum 6.

The taste is clean, crisp with a nice hoppy bite at the end. Good stuff!","  rDev This one is great pils.   Perfectly clear yellow body, nice white head.  Herbal and grainy smell.  As it warms the hops come out wonderfully. Noble hops are present there for sure. I'd say this is a combination of hops with a big proportion of saaz.  The balance and drinkability are amazing. A real drink of thirst.  A classy beer.","  rDev Pours a clear golden color with a one inch white head that was well retained and left lots of lacing. Smells and tastes of grassy hops, floral notes, grains, light spice, and a malt presence in the background. Medium bodied, well carbonated, nice hop bitterness and a dry finish. Very well done.","  rDev On tap at Das Biergarten. Clear golden yellow. Smells of spicy and grassy hops. A hint of bright tropical fruit hops. Tastes of grassy and spicy hops throughout.

Very good.","  rDev Well, my peeps, I think it’s safe to say that I have finally found my Pilsner! Prima is glorious and delicate like Audrey Hepburn shopping for a new clutch. On top of that is a smooth grassiness like Simba rollin’ around the jungle floor before Scar offed his father.  Just goodness here, my peeps.","  rDev 12oz bottle, enjoy by date was smudged but known to be fresh, poured into a Victory snifter glass. Enjoyed on 8.2.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.  The beer pours a bright golden color, nice clarity with just a hint of chill haze and a tall white head with good retention and soapy lace. The aroma is great, bright noble hops with a nice crisp earthiness, mineral water, pale grain, lightly floral with a bit of citrus. The flavors are nice, crisp hops, cirtrusy with a nice grassiness that offers light bitterness with plenty of grain and mineral water and a touch of grapefruit peel at the finish. The mouthfeel is good, crisp, light, delicate with nice a dry finish.  Verdict: A very good pilsener from Victory. Perhaps the quintessential example of the style brewed in America, nice balance, so refreshing and easy to drink.","  rDev Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a light golden color with a small white head. The aroma is sweet malt. The taste is a ton of hops with a dry finish.","  By far the best Pils I have had to date...  Though not my preferred beer style, Pilseners are one of those styles that in my mind I should like more, but I don't, and I'm not entirely sure why. But this pils, holy crap, this is a pils I can get into. Though not much to look at out of the can - much of an also ran yellow-ish beer color, it does have a nice frothy head and a tiny bit of lacing. The smell has a malty character with orange undertones, which contrasts the crisp (is that lemongrass I taste) lemony flavor sloshing around in my mouth. Mouthfeel is very light and has a dry finish as advertised. Again, quite possibly the best pils I've had, and I'm glad I have a few more on hand to partake.","  rDev Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Willi Becher glass. 4.25/3.5/3.5/4/4 A: Hazy yellow orange with heavy effervescence and two fingers of short-lived, white head. S: Sweet, sulfuric, and crisp. A metallic tang amongst the fruity-malty grain. T: Clean and lightly sweet. This is an excellent pilsner. But there's not a lot going on. The grain isn't sulfuric in the taste, unless that's the lightly bitter bite on the endtaste, but I think not. The mouthfeel is moderate, with some fizz and some heavier sugars. O: Lightly sweet, balanced, clean. But aside from a mild floralness, a perfectly balanced bitterness, and an interesting whiff of fruit, I might as well be drinking fizzy wheat tea. Very mild. But sometimes that's what you want.","  rDev 12 oz can poured into a  Pilsner  tulip glass. Best by 10/4/2017. Bright, but cloudy gold, with a one finger head that moves to a thin lace after a few swigs. Good lace retention on the side of the glass. The aroma is crips hops, bread, and grass. The taste follows suit, with some lemon notes. Mouthfeel is medium light with medium carbonation.. Glad I waited on reviewing this, the initial six I bought turned out to be past the best by date and was a little off. This is not.","  rDev Grassy, toasted barley and lots of noble hop earthiness. Clean and crisp. Slightly bitter finish, almost dank. The American standard of a German classic.","  rDev Pours a medium straw producing 2 fingers of white, moderately lasting head &amp; patchy lacing. Aroma is biscuity malt, floral &amp; light lemon hop tones, some faint grass. Taste is similar with crisp, clean grain, bread &amp; more intense hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium+ carbonation, slight pepper in the finish.","  rDev Bottled BB end of March, 2017 Pours with a little more chill haze than it ends up with when it is a straw yellow/white. The body is mostly clear and you can easily see laconic bubbles rising to the surface.. The head doesn't grow too large, even with a fairly vigorous pour. The head has a foamy soapy look and provides nice lines of lacing.  The nose has a grassy/crackery note to it. The pilsner malt comes out nicely, and the bittering hops are not rushing at my olfactory sense. There's perhaps just a little citrus - a sweet-tart little spritz in the mix as well.  A medium bodied beer, the up front notes come mainly from the malt, a thick cracker-like taste. A grassy background grabs my palate's attention as it focuses on it. As the hops come forward, there's a brief note of cardboard. Fleeting, the grassy hops some forth to shake my tongue. There is a decent little effervescence here that is mildly distracting to me but might be considered refreshing to others. The lingering notes sometimes seem to have a little unripe grapefruit pith to it.  A classic beer that was one of the first beers that turned the tide for me on desiring a hoppy, more bitter beer. Fond memories, for sure, but I still really enjoyed it these many years later.","  rDev Pours a deep gold, not as pale as most pilsners that I'm used to. Some floral hop aroma. It's very grapey with a little bit of bite on the finish. A decent pilsner that's different from the others in the local market.","  rDev Lushious golden body with the perfect amount of haze, with a 2 finger fluffy head. Lots of glorious lace left as well. Just awesome. As good as it gets for a pilsner.   Crisp malts and honey on the nose, light oat.   Very tasty, very clean. Lots of grain flavors to start, with a pleasant fruity banana aftertaste. This is not devoid of hops however - as lots of czech influence comes out to play with sharp biting hops thoughout. Bready finish.   Feel is crisp, smooth, clean. Exactly as a pils should be.   Overall, I totally get the hype with this one. A world-class pilsner in every right.","  rDev A: crystal clear; pale gold in color; 1 finger finely pored white head that receded to a very thin cap; nice lacing;  S: grainy malt; a hint of grass;  T: muted; follows the nose; mild bitterness on the finish;  M: light to medium bodied; moderate carbonation;  O: very easy drinking;","  rDev Clear yellow-gold with a large, bright white, foamy head.  Smell is banana bread, or is it cornbread, with bitter grass, a little piney cologne, and even some pungent funk. I get tortilla chip as it warms.  Taste is astringent hops, grass, grapefruit rind, and pine tar. This is wild, and somewhat harsh--I see why this was considered, and still is, extreme for the style. Lemon and light wheat are also there.  Feel is quite dry and bitter."]},{"Name":"Narwhal","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/86149/","Brewery":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","Style":"Stout - Russian Imperial","Alcohol":10.20,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev 12 oz can, 2020 vers.

It pours a thick looking oily black, very clear.   The smell is of chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, char, molasses and I think just a hint of licorice.  What I find surprising in the taste is the chocolate, but this is fresh and I look forward to letting this age and seeing how it changes, but right now I am getting a significant chocolate flavor, that seems slightly sweet at first but as the coffee and roasted malt takes over, the sweet sensation fades to a hefty but short-lived combo bite of char, espresso, acridity, and some bitterness. Coffee acridity and char lingers a little, but pleasantly.   Even young, no alcohol beyond a pleasant warmth. I'd call it medium body, somewhat creamy, just enough carbonation to hold it up.

The aroma is aptly described on the label, as there are  notes of oak, vanilla and coconut. The head transitions into some nice glass lacing. This is a poignant tasting affair. The delicious roasted malt forward is rich and velvety smooth. It really does bring notes of oak, vanilla, coconut and even a little dark chocolate along the way to an expresso and slightly alcoholic finish. The slight alcohol taste there only augments the overall. A whale of a great brew.","  rDev I cant believe Ive never reviewed this beer before. 2020 vintage poured at cellar temp into my snifter. The beer pours a dark coffee color with no light passing through my glass. A creamy tan head of 1.5 cm foams up and rests on the surface as a dense creamy covering. Super dense lattice that clings to my glass on a swirl and after each sip. THe aroma is rich and malty with dark chocolates, roasted malt, some light char notes and a bit of molasses. Maybe a little earthy hops but this is definitely a malt dominant nose. First sip reveals a medium to thick body with smooth texture and fine and very tingly carbonation. The beer drinks very easy and doesnt have any stickiness or chewiness to it. Could be a little thicker body if I had to find a complaint.  Flavor is roasted malts, dark chocolate, almost like bakers chocolate with a bitterness to it. I also get some molasses and a bit of dark fruit in the middle, but this gets buried by bitter bakers chocolate and roast on the finish.  No hop character on the flavor profile and the alcohol is also very well hidden, making this a little bit of a dangerous beer.

This is much more of a true stout than the current pastry craze and is more roasted grain with finesse than vanilla/chcolate/malty/sugary pastry that has become the rage. Much more traditional in style but also more of a  beer drinker's stout  than a dessert or syrup for ice cream!","  rDev Bottled 8/8/19  Black ,with some dark brown at the edges, with a moderate , quickly-dissipating tan head.   Smell is chocolate liqueur, cocoa, and a vaguely minty aroma, which I'm guessing is alcohol+something else(hops?).   Taste is almost-unsweetened chocolate brownie, cola, yesterday's coffee, finishing with slight roasted nut (pecan+walnut) flavor. Light bitterness that comes in late.  Feel is high-side of medium , oily, with some late, very very fine carbonation tingle.  Overall, it's a good non-BA stout. Worth a try if you like that sort of thing.

Really solid imperial stout with probably the coolest artwork out there.","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed January 2014.  All of the components are here but the boozy, vinous, and lactic/acidic notes detract from an otherwise solid stout. A mixed bag IMO. ","  rDev L- Completely black, not a photon gets through it. Pours with 5mm fine-bubble mid-tan head, slowly receding. S- Coffee, with a rich sense. T- Pungent coffee, quite a prominent charred smokey edge to it with intense deep molasses. F- Rich (occasional fleeting hints of 'sweet'), pungent, right in the winter-warmer category for me. Carbonation in the glass and mouth are both still good. O- This might be the most pungent American beer I've had; I wonder how this divides people over there? I like it, but people not into strong coffee might enjoy it less.

A: Pours a basically black color with a less than one finger, light brown head, rim retention, and spotty lacing. S: Aromas of black coffee, unsweetened chocolate, orange zest, walnut, and licorice. A white pepper note. T: Sweet to semisweet. Flavors follow the nose. Bitterness solid and consistent with the style. M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Almost chewy, but very crushable. O: A really delicious Russian Imperial Stout. Always fascinated by the beast, now, I supposed I have a new object of fascination.","  rDev My bottle was a 2012 vintage and I finally decided to crack it open in honor of the London citizens that used a narwhal tusk to thwart the terrorist attack. Beer held up very, very well and I was pleasantly surprised on how well it was made.","  rDev I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet, obviously one of the better Imperial Stouts on the shelf right now.  A: Pours a near opaque black color, with just a hint of red around the bottom and edges. A dense tan head rises to two fingers with excellent retention. Some lace left behind as well. S: A huge malt aroma, with roasted malts, espresso, bittersweet chocolate. Black liquorice, and even some grassy hoppy aromas. Tons going on and it is all in balance and excellent. T: Like the nose, an incredibly nuanced malt flavor. That goes from roasted to coffee/espresso, bitter chocolate, toffee. Black liquorice again, and a lingering bitterness builds as this warms. From a combination of a substantial grassy hop presents as well as bitter bakers chocolate. Again, really balanced and excellent.  M/O: A full body with crisp carbonation for the style. That smooths out as this breaths and becomes a bit more resinous and sticky without being overbearing. A great sipper, one of the more pleasing Imperial Stouts to drink. As I never tire of this, and it never becomes too much of a chore to sip on.  Yep, like I have said above, one of the better examples of the style. It also ages well. A classic from Sierra Nevada. I'd have to have this side by side with Old Rasputin but both are tops for me in this style.","  rDev 2019 vintage. Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. Packaged 10/16/19.

S: Bittersweet chocolate, espresso, woodsmoke, and a hint of char. T: Quick burst of dark dried fruit, quickly followed by woodsmoke, char, and baker’s chocolate. Hint of espresso in the background. M: Medium heavy body. Darkly sweet and dry throughout. Moderately bitter. Lingers and matures on the palate. D: Nice winter sipper. Really like the woodsmoke and char notes as well as the baker’s chocolate.","  rDev Poured to a snifter glass.  A: Body is dark and syrupy while head is brown-ish, past the beige color. S: Aroma is very good on roasted malts that resemble dark chocolate, molasses and milk chocolate. There's a slight hint of alcohol but barely noticeable. T: Taste is incredible with a generous part of sweetness incoming from the blend of roasted malts that results and a balancing bitter tone from the chocolate itself - not sure if was used at all. It's not a pastry stout but it's a close-to-perfection-grade old-school style beer. It's not fashionable but it's damn relevant. M: Body is medium to high. Alcohol is barely noticeable.

Lots of wood,licorice, and very earthy","  rDev Bottled on 9/6/19  Pours a deep black body topped with around a finger of dark khaki foam; the head recedes fairly quickly to minimal spotty lacing, paper-thin islands of cap, and a bubbly collar of froth.  Aroma is heavy on the roasted malts to open, leading into dark chocolate, dark fruit (raspberry and blackberry), and nutty tones of peanut and walnut; subtle light roast coffee and quiet vanilla sweetness maintains a balanced, growing prominence in the backdrop.  Taste shows underlying dark fruits interwoven between toasted malts/grain and bakers chocolate; milk chocolate contrasts a building roasty bitterness and minor astringency in the finish.  Mouthfeel has a light-medium body and carbonation with a creamy peak along the mid-palate as a level, roasty bitterness/malty char builds along the way into the finish.  A well-executed old-school feel to this stout sees ample roastier tones shine against an understated backdrop of malty sweetness. The bitterness works to a good degree here until the astringency sneaks in and begins to hold this one back; even-keeled, nicely defined character, and very solid overall otherwise.","  rDev Very dark appearance with nice tan head.

Bakers chocolate, fresh earth &amp; faint strawberry flavors up front; black coffee notes on the finish.   The nose promised a fruity treat, but the flavor was a harsh RIS all the way.   Interesting, but I liked the nose better. Perhaps age would tease that strawberry out...","  rDev While many love this stout. There is just something about Narwhal for me - an oddity. One time I placed this as a hint of grape cough syrup, but only that one time. Not a fan.","  rDev Pours a perfect pitch black, like the darkest depths of the arctic sea, with a muddy cocoa ice floe of a head about a finger and a half thick that persists deep into the arctic summer. Rich chocolate and raisin smell. Other deep dark brew notes like prune, coffee, tobacco and the abyss.  Taste is bitter sweet, dark chocolate, some coffee roastiness, sweetness that hints at plum and black cherry and blueberry. Incredibly coherent flavor, many complex beers parade tastes across your tongue, this one arrives wholly formed and settles in like an arctic winter.  Mouthfeel is quite pleasant, not as pillowy as some big stouts I've tried and a tad bit toward the syrupy, but overall this is one fine expedition of an ale. Overall this is one of my favorite big stouts, hard to beat it in terms of value, accessibility, and downright, no nonsense, beery deliciousness. Can't wait to see how this monster ages.","  rDev Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, chocolate. Taste is of alcohol, chocolate, roasted malts, more bitterness than I expected, did I mention it is boozy? Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good beer, but I was expecting more.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Label is stamped for bottling date of '09/20/18'. Black colored body, with very slight dark brown highlights when back lit. Half a finger of light tan head stays around as creamy cap and higher ring. Each sip leaves behind some lacing but most slide back down into the beer. Aroma of dark roasted malts, with strong coffee and layers of chocolate smells. There is a little smoke, which presents itself stronger in the taste.  Taste is dark roasted malts, espresso coffee, and chocolate from milk to dark cacao. Hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and dark fruit. Thick, creamy mouth feel. Alcohol gets into the nasal passages. Adequate carbonation, but more flat than bubbly. Kind of dry at the end. This is a complex tasting stout, well balanced, and a pleasure to drink. Has a range of expressions from sweet, to dry, to smoky.","  rDev 2018 vintage - 12oz bottled on 8-30-18  1 1/2  dense tan head on a black stout that has the faintest brown tint at the edges. Great retention at 1/2  and thick foamy lace. Looks great. Sweet, dark roasted malts. Coffee with cream aroma. Spicy hops are in the mix as well. Bitter dark chocolate. Strong espresso flavor, roasted malt bitterness. Charred flavor. Piney hops are present currently. Medium body (??) not as full/velvety as expected. By no means thin but on the RIS scale it's medium bodied in my opinion. Not medium flavored though as this packs a LONG lasting finish of bitter roasted malts and hops. Tannic, chalky mouthfeel. Really good especially so early on. Bottled only 5 weeks ago.","  rDev Polished black marble with a creamy dark tan film and collar.  Smell has a brighter note to it than you'd expect, like pungent, sweaty peach, paired with the more expected elements of smoked almond, baker's cocoa and tobacco.  Taste is nutty licorice, cedar that nears a piney bitterness, almond paste and cocoa liqueur that's a bit warming with a slight sting on the swallow.  The round body has a crisp fizz that leads into a semi-dry, woody exhale.","  rDev Pours pitch black with a tan head, Smell was roasted malts and chocolate. Taste had cocoa and hops with some musty leather a nutty finish. mouth feel had some roasted bitterness in the finish.","  rDev Surprised I never rated this one. Drinking a year and a half old bottle from August 2016. Roasty malt and chocolate notes on the nose, taste is almost bitter for a stout. Not really roasty, but definitely some chocolate and coffee notes. I see smoky in the below description, and that's a pretty good word for it. Smooth, not oily at all. Pretty good, but not as great as I've been led to believe. Maybe I should review one fresh.  Edit: drinking a seven month old bottle, up the taste and overall review to 4.25. Great cigar beer.","  rDev 12 oz bottle, 2017 version, dated 8/22/17. Poured into a tulip glass, pitch black with a half finger quickly disappearing tan lace. The aroma is coffee,cocoa powder, roasted grains and chocolate. Sprinkle in some anise to that on the taste. Mainly cocoa and coffee. As it warms, chocolate takes the forefront. Fairly full feel, the carbonation is medium low. Overall, a tasty RIS."]},{"Name":"Finestkind IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/141/16403/","Brewery":"Smuttynose Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":6.90,"Score":91.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 ml bottle, as Smuttynose Finestkind IPA, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger.

I was hoping this was a 3-month dating window, not 6 months but I'm inclined to guess the latter as the flavor and aroma were not all that impressive. Some pine, grapefruit, and pithy bitterness. Meh.","  rDev Can = pours a lightly hazed gold with a 1 finger white cap that reduces but lasts - aroma is grapefruit-floral-piney with a decent sweet malt underpinning flavor follows aroma - clean finish, not overly hoppy but a session IP decent but not distinct.","  rDev Drank it from the bottle. Dank, piney hops and lightly sweet malt in the nose and taste. Perfectly balanced. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Effing delicious, old-school IPA.","  rDev 473 ml can served cold into a mug. Purchased from the LCBO for $3.15 CDN. Best before July 2017.  Appearance - a hazy rich golden coloured beer with orange highlights. Rather juice looking. A fine finger of white is poured, had good staying power and a film of lacing wraps around the top of the mug.  Smell - some citrus, pine resin are stars. There's a freshness here to the aroma that is rather inviting. Possibly some orange.  Taste - plenty of hops, citrus with grapefruit and lemon very minimal sweetness. Somewhat earthy and with some more pine resin, a nice blend of flavours that give no doubt this is an IPA. Would love just a little more sweetness, but this is quite good. Tastes better the more you drink of it.  Mouthfeel - smooth and crisp, medium bodied, leaning towards the heavy end of things. Prickly carbonation and dry finish.  Overall - this one didn't quite live up to expectations, but still a very solid IPA. I certainly see why it is highly recommended.","  rDev 16 oz tallboy from the LCBO; best before July 6 2017 and served slightly chilled.   Pours a hazy golden-amber hue, with just over a finger's width of foamy, frothy white head seated atop. It recedes evenly over the better part of five minutes, smothering the glass with a curtain of sticky lace as it does so, eventually leaving behind a generously-sized collar of creamy foam. The aroma is just one burst of hops after another, underlain with some bready, caramelized malt sweetness - there's citrusy grapefruit and orange, with loads of earthy pine resin as well as a mixture of dank, herbal, floral and earthy elements.   A delicious, flavourful IPA with a near-juicy feel at times from the fruity, citrusy aspects of its hop profile. Bready malts and some light caramel notes provide the scaffolding, but it's the flavours of orange and grapefruit which really leap out at me. Not to leave out the apricot, mango and pineapple, or the tsunami of bitterness that sweeps over your palate as you approach the latter half of the sip. Pine resin, dank herb and citrus pith, with lots of earthy bitterness, and it's all wrapped up nicely by some floral hops, which leave a dry feel on the palate. Medium-bodied, leaning toward the fuller side, with mild carbonation and a smooth, satisfying texture; a little slick/oily, feeling like it coats the tongue with each sip. As an unabashed hophead, I figured I was going to like this one, and it did not disappoint whatsoever.  Final Grade: 4.4, an excellent A grade. Finest Kind IPA is the sort of near-flawless, aggressively-hopped American IPA that brewers in Ontario have been attempting to emulate for years. Only a few of them have truly succeeded, however - because I really feel that Smuttynose's example here is better than 90% of the domestic stuff that I can find at the LCBO. This is only the 2nd Smuttynose beer I've had the chance to try, but I will definitely be keeping an eye out for more in the future. In the mean time, I'll be buying these cans regularly while they remain stocked and fresh. A great way to celebrate my 1400th review - cheers!","  rDev Pours a halfway mix between juicy and clear. Kind of glassy, hazy, just nice. And of course golden. 2 finger head of just glorious proportions. Webs around the glass. '  An amazing nose. Just so fresh, clean, bright...full of pine, citrus, orange juice and pith, and some light but pleasant caramel notes.   Pretty piney, with citrus accents, some light toffee, then a dash of onion and dank. Becomes a little harsh after awhile. Still real drinkable.   Heavily carbonated with a resinous pith. Slight stickiness. Semi-dryness on the finish.   Overall, worth the hype but for sure it's a bit intense after a few sips. Recommended for hopheads.","  rDev Pours slightly hazy brass with a choppy shortlived head. Ridges of lace coat the glass on the way down. Tangerine, grapefruit, honey and cracker-like pale malts in the nose. Huge wall of citrusy hops in the first sip gives way to tropical fruit and floral hop flavors. Eucalyptus bitterness is prominent throughout. A very solid - but never distracting - bready malt profile provides just enough balance. Full bodied with high carbonation. Mouthcoating bitterness and more citrusy, tropical notes in the very long finish.  This is a fantastic, benchmark IPA. Jam packed with juicy hops and loads of bitterness, but still balanced and approachable. A must try.","  rDev Dull golden appearance, yellow, almost 1.5  of white head, good retention. Looks the part. Aroma was not giving up any of the Amarillo goodness. Disappointed I am son.  Taste was a ton of bitterness, the Simcoe is definitely representing. Santiam, can never taste those so I dunno. Alcohol too pronounced. Lots of bitterness, but they do it without drenching the beer in crystal malt, so that's nice at least. I don't get the love for this one. Good, not great.","  rDev Look: It pours golden with a slightly moderate off white head. It has some lacing and a bit of haze.   Smell: It has aromas of toast, light caramel, low floral and a bit of grass.   Taste: It has flavors of floral, toast, light caramel, and floral.   Feel: It has a moderate body and has a moderately bitter finish.   Overall this is a very favorable and easy drinking IPA.","  rDev Orange amber with a beige ring that leaves sporadic lace.  Smell is pine, grapefruit candy, and melon.  Taste changes over to melon candy, and piney hops, but is not too bitter.  Soft and froth. A favorite of the old lady's, especially with that label.","  rDev Pours mostly clear, slightly hazy golden amber with a dense creamy white foam head. Smells like sweet honey malt, zesty fresh lemony orange and grapefruit citrus, some tropical notes, mild caramel, with earthy floral grass and pine. Tastes like biscuity honey malt, very dank floral earthy herbal hops, woody grassy pine, very herbaceous, with a touch of caramel cracker and zesty tropical citrus. Feels medium bodied, thick and creamy with low carbonation. Overall a real nice earthy herbaceous IPA.","  rDev Comes in a clear, slightly bubbly gold color with a solid finger of tight white head. Head dies a bit after a minute, but retention is mostly excellent, as a ring of head stays for the duration of the drinking process and it leaves nice lacing along the glass. The aroma reeks of Simcoe--wet cannabis, dankness, pine, a bit of the  cat pee  thing. A big dose of lemon peel. There's zesty orange and some sweet bready malts. Up front, you get a bit hit of pine and dankness. In the middle, you get biscuit malt sweetness, but it is fairly unobtrusive. There is a big herbal character, like basil and kale. The finish is medium-plus bitter, dry, and citrusy. Grapefruit pith, lemon, orange peel. The aftertaste lingers of citrus peel. The mouthfeel is medium, almost medium-plus. Almost creamy in its heavy-handed hop oiliness. Finishes dry and is very drinkable.   This is one of the best widely available IPAs of the Northeast. Highly recommended for any hophead in search of a bang for their buck.","  rDev I used to drink Smutty Finest Kind pretty steadily on-tap while playing trivia on Wednesday nights at Brendee's Irish Pub, but I fell out of that habit after moving to the other side of town &amp; frankly, I never expected to see it in a CAN! Viva The CANQuest (tm)!  From the CAN:  Brewing fine beers in NH since 1994 ;  Make mine a Smutty! ;  Please recycle and be nice to each other.   Man, these brimful craft CANs are really giving me fits today! Once more, the Crack! had no room for the tab to go &amp; resulted in some light foaming through the vent as a result. A brief calming period was then followed by a gentle Glug and then by an in-glass swirl. This last raised a finger of dense, foamy, tawny head with good retention that left nice lacing in its wake. Color was solidly Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was like welcoming back an old friend with the familiar blend of grapefruit citrus &amp; pine menthol from the hops, underlain by a caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was more lemony than grapefruit, and more biscuity than caramel, but the pine coolness was very evident. The Notes section mentions 75 IBUs, but it was well-hidden. That, or my self-described/self-avowed hophead self has become inured to high IBU beers. Uh oh. This was a very tasty, easy to drink AIPA that did not see fit to beat my poor, bruised tongue into submission. Finish was cool, dry, lightly citrusy and a real pleasure. I am very glad to see in come in a CAN!","  rDev Golden colour, thumb of head, solid retention and sheeting lacing. Fruity mangos and hints of citrus and mandarin on the nose. Nice bitter citrus flavors dominate alongside a solid fruity backbone of mango and pineapple. Fantastic rendition of the style.","  rDev I’M BACK!!! With a bang too - Smuttynose Finestkind IPA! Well as it turns out my fitness regime is doing well and I’m permitting myself 1 beer to review per week, which allows the Doc beer reviewing goodness to continue unabated! [Villagers: “Yay!”]. So Smuttynose is one of those legendary American IPAs that people whisper about in some sort of garbled incoherent copiously hop-driven breath on various beer sites around the world (aka ‘Merica!). It has long been a target on my BIG beer hit list, and now like the ale equivalent of Ramón Mercader I am about to plunge my ice pick (i.e. my tastebuds) into its ear (i.e. my beer glass).  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Presents a cloudy/turbid sunburst orange with a 2 cm white/cream head that won’t quit. Plenty of carbonation action inside the glass but we know better than to judge against that (even though this is an IPA not a Lager dammit). Man that head is still there even after my whole preamble, impressive head. 9/10.  S: Sweet orange blossom citrus notes mingle with a hint of dirty, earthy hops and yep - you guessed it: Bold piney characters. This is hops all the way baby! The defining feature of this brew IMO is how floral it comes on in the aroma - almost touching on a Fraoch (or Heather Ale) with its flowery scent, bravo. 9/10.  T: Assertive yet restrained hop bitterness really lays down the gauntlet to more dry than sweet malt characters. From beginning to end this is a hop-driven IPA and it is unabashed about it. Flavours range the gamut from: Piney, citric, grapefruit through to dirty, earthy and floral notes. The finish is bitter but not overly so compared to most American IPAs. This is then a superlative effort from the smuttiest of noses. 9/10.  M: Mid to light, almost medium bodied with a light, almost flat carbonation. If there is any negative to be had with this brew it would be with the body, a touch light, but I am nit-picking now. 8/10.  D: Best beer I’ve had from New Hampshire... [erm, the only beer I’ve had from New Hampshire, but the point still stands!]. The 2 biggest pluses to this brew, the takeaway points if you will, are 1: The floral aroma, and 2: The even-handed but assertive bitterness throughout. In fact it’s only after sipping my next brew did I realise I could still taste bitterness from the Smuttynose and that was a week later! [Lies, damnable lies!]. 9/10.  Food match: Make it Asian cuisine with some spice - you’re gonna need it."]},{"Name":"Newcastle Brown Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/81/639/","Brewery":"Heineken Nederland B.V.","Style":"Brown Ale - English","Alcohol":4.70,"Score":76.0,"Comments":["  rDev I still remmeber stealing a few of these out of my dad's minifridge to bring to a neighbor girl's house, swigging it while grimacing, pretending to like it...

A good but somewhat overrated beer. Aggressively carbonated. Better in the Good Old Days when it was stronger.  Rerate, draught in Newcastle: I found the colour to be darker brown than the bottled version (can that be?), and the flavour was fuller and richer - even though the pub tried to ruin it by serving it ice cold.","  rDev Have had Newcastle Brown more than a few times over the years, but until today, when had poured from 12-oz. bottle into nonic pint, have not had since 2012, when it went well with tacos, or since it has been brewed in the U.S. by Lagunitas.  This beer looks every bit a beautiful English brown, from amber-brown color to lovely light-tan head and lace. Aroma is Noble hops and mild malt, but there's not much of either. Both and even a little fruit are there on drinking, but barely.  Heineken and Lagunitas would seem to be bravely preserving the Newcastle Brown tradition.","  rDev Pours brown with a ruddy, ruby transparency when held against the light. Finger of white foam with poor retention. Aroma is nutty, caramely and bready malts with toffee, raisins and molasses to add a little touch of sweetness and depth. Flavor profile is caramely, bready and nutty with light molasses, raisins and toffee. It's unoffensive and easy-going with a hint of sweetness. Mouth feel is lightly creamy with a very fine grit to it. Thickness is medium. Overall, soft toffee makes it a chewy, sweet candy bar within an unoffensive, mild brown ale.   Bottle. Reviewed from notes.","  rDev Gosh, how is this no longer brewed in the U.K.? I'm getting old and know it since I used to love this beer and it's dark, ruddy, sticky nature. This brew was nothing like that as it seemed as watered-down as any mass-market brew from here in the states. I know that my tastes have changed but please, it's a crime to alter a beer this much and keep the label the same!  Sure, this poured brown and clear but what else would you expect from an English Brown Ale? Not a lot of nuts or caramel in the aroma as it felt like herbal tea and not-so-dark bread. Hints of Yuengling (which is a lager) could be found here as this needed more nuts and malt to give it heft. Hints of apple and pear came through on the palate making this feel like a light Marzen or Octoberfest, with the caramel and roasted body being a distant memory to this longtime imbiber. Lightly carbonated and lacking in lacing, this felt like a weak beer that's seen better days, but lived off it's past glory that had faded long ago...  Sure, there's hardly any booze here but as I remember from my younger days  Where's the beef?  would be the appropriate catchphrase for this hallmark of a beer. Yes, the meat and bulk were not to be found here but you wouldn't know it based on it's reputation. Have this for old time's sake but also have it to realize how far we've come from this, and how bad corporate mergers have been for this industry...","  rDev Reviewed as part of BJCP training. 13B British Brown Ale. Best by Sept 2019. Never reviewed it as the clear bottle always scared me. Still have no idea why they keep it clear this day and age  Pours a decent fizzy bubbly smaller head with decent retention, mild lacing, very clear medium to lighter amber-brown almost ruby color  Nose thankfully no skunk, more sweet aromas, caramel, toffee, a little biscuity brown malt, a bit of chocolate, and light herbal earthy hops that blend nicely with the rest of the beer, and a hint of fruity esters in the background  Taste malt up front, a little toasty and biscuity but more in the caramel toffee range, seems to come on a little sweet but isn't actually sweet, mild mineral notes in the background, as well as a flash of fruity esters, hops come with a little earthy note and lighter bitterness, a light chocolate as well, finishes a bit on the sweeter side but more towards dry, a touch of mineral or maybe skunky note finally coming through  Mouth is med bod, a little soft creamy feel, with medium but creamy carbonation  Overall not bad, thankfully not skunky like I expected, so it must have been handled well. When not skunky it's a pretty decent British Brown.","  rDev Pours a clear, deep, dark mahogany coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smells of toasted, bready, caramel malt and a distinct nuttiness, with a hint of brown sugar. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by toasted, bready, caramel malt, although there are some light floral, herbal hops in there somewhere as well, with notes of roasted nuts, brown sugar, corn and a mild diacetyl butteriness. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and slightly unpleasant diacetyl/corn aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel with a light body and medium carbonation.  This has some decent toasted, caramel malt notes and a good nuttiness to it, but really suffers from mild diacetyl and corn notes as well as a rather light and watery body. It's drinkable enough, but certainly nothing special.","  rDev From notes 2/8/13: Pours a clear cola brown producing only a single finger of off-white, flimsy, soap bubble, rapidly diminishing head that leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is weak and thin with toasted and caramel malts, roasted nuts and as expected little detectable hop profile. Taste is only a slightly more robust version of the nose with a little bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Some bottles have a hint of butter after mid-sip and it is not uncommon to get a hint of skunk. Mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation.","  rDev Poured from a clear bottle into a tulip glass. Clear brown color with decent head and lacing. A bit of a sweet skunky smell. Taste of roasted malt, a bit sweet. I remember this being downright exotic back in the day. An ok classic!","  rDev On tap: A clear medium brown, with a revivable head that likes the edges when calm.  A caramel leaning neutral nose. There’s an expectation of a malty beer here.  Taste doesn’t follow through, thankfully. There’s still a caramel sweetness, and barely any (but a little) breadiness to the malt side. Neutral bitterness does counter this to keep it from being a malt bomb. Still leans sweet.  Decently lively carbonation despite the look. This beer was at one point such a different thing, it was near one of my favorites. I’ve definitely changed, not sure if it has. Liking it better than my last memory, but not as much as I once did.","  rDev Pours a deep auburn brown with a medium head that has slightly less than average retention but does leave some lace. Nose is lightly malty, lightly cardboardy, slight butter, and overall clean. Taste is also malty, but with a little better balance than expected. Light, but reasonable flavor, and the slight diactyl on the nose didn't impact the taste. A bit watery, but reasonable for a 4.7% beer. Overall, not great, but not as bad as the reviews suggest.","  rDev Pours a clear light brown with a half inch off white head that left no lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of lightly roasted malts and tastes on the sweet side. A very simple beer, Lightly carbonated light mouth feel ( slightly watery), light bodied. Decent choice when the only other options are macro lagers.","  rDev Pours a dark brown color with a minimal off-white head that disappears quickly. Aroma is malt. Tastes of malt with a hint of hoppy bitterness at the finish.","  rDev There isn't a whole lot not to like about this. Nice caramel-sauce color, with a decent off-white head and lots of lacing. The aroma and flavor are heavy with notes of caramel, dark bread, prunes, and raisins. The beer is rather light in body and mouthfeel and not overly sweet on the palate. The finish is clean, with a slightly bitter note. This is pleasant and drinkable, and would make a decent pairing with a variety of foods.","  rDev Pours a clear amber color with a half a finger of effervescent off-white head. Has some decent retention, but leaves very little in the way of lacing. Decent looking beer in a pint glass.   The aroma is very, very faint. There are notes of corn and roasted grains, with perhaps the slightest hint of toffee on the back end.   The taste is underwhelming, to say the least. Grainy, with some faint notes of caramel. There's a tinny, metallic taste that comes through in spades on the finish. Bitterness is low.   The feel is light bodied with relatively high carbonation. Carbonation is right for the style but the body is rather thin and watery.   Overall, a pretty damn poor example of an English Brown Ale. Granted, it's an easy drinker and perhaps a bit more flavorful than a Bud Light, which is probably what they're going for nowadays. Still not something I'd pick up on the regular.","  rDev Listed in the  1001 , my review to come upon a re-taste with open mind. MJ's  Guide  gave this 3 of 4 stars, but that was before Heineken bought it.","  rDev ** 06/28/12 On Tap at the Cabin, Freehold, NJ AROMA: Nutty Aroma, some vanilla LOOK: Light brown. Very Small Head. TASTE: Not bad.

Why Breweries still don't use brown bottles is beyond me","  rDev Clear bottle and thin brown pour make me think how weak. Aroma was not much, maybe some tea leaves, not enjoyable.  Taste is a thin but earthy experience, if you don't like hops maybe this is your cup of tea. Kind of has quite a bit in common with tea actually. There's a tad of sweetness, but as far as malt, hops and yeast, I really don't pick up much discernable stuff.","  rDev Another maligned IMO legacy brew. A gateway for me along with some others that got me looking for something more than yellow macros. Look: light, clear brown. Not much head to speak of. Smell: light caramel, fruit and nuts. Not spectacular but a decent enough brew IMO.","  rDev Comes in a clear, reddish brown color with a thin white head that leaves spotty lacing.  The aroma offers toffee, caramel,cashews, and brown sugar.  Upfront you get semi-harsh graininess and minerality, and a touch of grass, and then darkly toasted brown bread, caramelized brown sugar, caramel candy, a nice cashew/pecan nuttiness, and a very lightly bitter earthy finish. Clean, with no aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is lightly, medium carbonated, moderately-high drinkability.  The most mainstream brown ale, yet somewhat quintessential. Satisfying, if not remarkable. Decent if not skunky. Worth drinking on occasion.","  rDev Color of dark amber (umber?) with small tan cap and lacing.  Sweetish toffee aroma with a hint of floral/spicy hops.  Flavor is approachably simple and pleasant. Touch of sweetness that accents the toffee. No roast malt bitterness apparent, flavors are the same from start through aftertaste. My BudLight friends like this and consider it richly flavored. My take is where's the rest of it. More a promise of flavor than real flavor (you know, malt, hops and stuff) but what's there is noticeable. It's like the clothier was going for Autumn Brown but took the cloth out of the dying vat too soon.  Relatively light texture.  Given the color and aroma I think this one could be improved with a step up in texture. Oats or other grains could beef it up and provide more to chew on but I'm not being consulted on the matter. I remember liking this in the past but that was a long time ago.","  rDev Here's one I haven't had in years. Poured from bottle to can glass. Color is an iced tea brown, and just as clear. Head is two foamy fingers that's gone before you blink. Aroma is skunked: stewed vegetables. Its somewhat foul and fascinating, I've heard and read about that skunked smell but this is the first time I've experienced it. Taste is quite different: slightly malty and nutty. Not a bad ale for a session if that's what you're looking for. Could do worse.","  rDev From Carrefour. In Ikea's pint glass. Watching Sons of Anarchy 6x06. Nothing special and watery, but very drinkable and with some taste. However, too much expensive for its quality. Should cost half for me to repeat.","  rDev The party beer last night, and a return to something that was a go-to when I drank beer in the late 90s or early 2000s. As I learned more about sun damage, I figured out why the beer could be so pleasant sometimes and swill another. Last nights had very little skunking, though, so was an example of why I drank the beer. The nose is still a bit harsh, with off notes, but the malt does shine, and carries through in the taste, where the hint of hop is just enough to keep this from tasting sweet. Light, and easy on the tongue, if this beer is in good shape it makes a rock solid drinker. Glad to revisit."]},{"Name":"Péché Mortel","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1141/10325/","Brewery":"Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":9.50,"Score":98.0,"Comments":["  rDev A - Pitch black pour with toffee colored lacing.  S - Intense chocolate roast aroma with some char and deep coffee aroma.  T - Coffee roast, char, deep chocolate malt roast all up front and ends with a lingering chocolate roast/coffee bitterness.  M - Full silky body with some slight thinness around the edges and very dry on the back of the tongue.  O - This is a Classic and fantastic Imperial Stout that never gets old. Highly recommended.","  rDev 11.5 oz bottle notched 1 0 2 (my research shows this is a batch number and means nothing) poured into teku glass at fridge temp 9.5% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with just a hint of light penetration around the edges. The head (or lack thereof) never fully develops and presents as the finest, razor thin ring around the glass. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring coffee and a hint of booze. The taste is bittersweet coffee, chocolate and slight oxidation. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, there's not a lot of life left in this bottle. I wish this beer was still imported. I would try fresh given the opportunity. Scores are skewed up as this bottle was just purchased off a room temperature shelf this week and has clearly suffered.","  rDev 341 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 9.5%. Black colour, moderate tan head. Aroma of coffee, roast malts and dark chocolate. Rich flavour, but not too sweet, notes of roast malts and strong coffee, also plenty of bittering hops. Hints of dark bitter chocolate and unsweetened liquorice. Good beer, but not as outstanding as expected.","  rDev Poured from a bottle that looks to be dated about 4 years old. Black as night with minimal chocolate milk head leaving scant lacing ,appears rather flat. Nose is muted coffee,smoky roasty malt and a bit of sweetness. Taste is mostly smoky with a slight bitterness. Interesting. Finishes almost like an espresso but drier and woody.","  rDev Nearly opaque, coal-black body with an incredibly dense, rocky, creamy light tan head; thick, sticky rings of foam cascade down the glass. Fine aroma of cocoa and milk chocolate, mocha and vanilla. The taste is made up of a quietly sweet chocolate and charred grain character; coffee bitterness builds strongly at the mid-point and lasts long into the finish. Heavy, silky smooth body; oily.  I've been searching for this beer for a while now, and happened upon it by accident on a trip yesterday up to Boulder, CO. And I have no idea if newer versions are available (this sample was bottled 2018-09-21), but this relatively older version tastes incredible. The coffee component is well-maintained. Balanced, complex and luxurious!","  rDev Consumed 3-Mar-2019 at Cambridge Brewing Co. Stout Week. Nice foam. Black color. Coffee and malt aroma and flavor. Moderate sweetness. Sweet finish.","  rDev Pours jet black with soft, tan foam.  Smell is very much about the coffee, but there is some fudge, hazelnuts and tobacco in the background.  Taste is roasty and again, very coffee driven. Notes of dark chocolate, fudge and pipe tobacco are also present along with a hint of ash and some bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated.  Overall, a very nice coffee stout, just lacking a little bit of body for me.","  rDev About as good as a non-barrel aged stout can get. Some think this beer is overrated, but I think it superbly roasty and very well balanced. I put it slightly above Fremont Dark Star and that is saying a lot.","  rDev Bottled on 5/4/18  Pours a deep black body with about a finger or so of creamy-looking tan foam; head retention is decent, and recedes slowly to a paper-thin cap and an only slightly thicker collar; ample bits of thick lacing wall a good portion of the glass with great consistency.  Aroma bursts with intensely roasty espresso, bringing a meddled depth of dark fruits hints of dark and milk chocolate; soft vanilla comes and goes, adding a semi-sweetness, while the interplay of vaguely present but punchy hops alongside roasty malt sees a foundational balance shine through.  Taste is largely familiar to the nose, still highlighting an unavoidably big, roasty coffee bean character bolstered with earthy dark chocolate malt and wisps of dark fruit; hints of smoke and light hops come in on the finish.  Mouthfeel brings a slight creaminess sitting atop a dry, medium body (fleeting thinness prevents it from getting any heftier) with leveled carbonation to start; a brilliant, roasty bitterness that pops across your tongue develops along the way; dry finish with a subtle but lasting roasty, gritty bitterness.  Intense coffee guides this one all the way, and it drags a ton of depth from the bean even at nearly a year old. Uniqueness on the palate caps things off for a pure, well-done coffee stout, and leaves me wanting to seek out both fresher bottles and variants.","  rDev Trade in from drunkenmess' cellar! 2015 edition. Smokestack Snifter.  Deep inky black pour though not as thick as some RIS (that that's ok) with a beige head of 1/2 finger.   I get metallic coffee and some Raisinets on the nose, with a slight caramel presence, piney hop, boozy oak, and more metal.   Flavor brings a good dose of piney hop to the table, almost like a Black IPA, with following thick sweetness, dry cocoa powder, and molasses. Metallic coffee and charred espresso bean is also dominant, with some chocolate notes popping up here and there. Caramel and dry boozy oak surface as well. It's a rough sipper though, very hoppy.   Feel is creamy and has a nice smooth carbonation to it. Resiny hops linger on the palate creating a film.   Overall a bit on the bitter side for me personally, it is more like a Black IPA with chocolate and oak than a great RIS. I've always liked my beers malty anyways unless it's an IPA (then bring on the hops!). Would likely pass next time as it's not my taste.","  rDev Popping the bottle cap unleashes a collection of aromas, led by dark, roasty coffee - and I am 3 feet away from the bottle. Incredible aromas.   The pour is as black as night, underneath a dense tan head. The first sip unleashes an onslaught of rich coffee flavors I’ve never experienced in any beer, but they’re not overwhelming - there’s some dark chocolate and a subtle toffee note to keep things nicely balanced.  The mouthfeel is substantial and, in spite of the heavy coffee notes, a bit creamy. This beer is more than worthy of the hype it receives, IMHO.","  rDev Thanksgiving morning beer!  Poured very dark brown from a bottle into a tulip glass. Good beige head and great lacing. Strong coffe smell. Great flavors of dark coffee, dark chocolate, berries and warm spice. Very nice beer!","  rDev Look: It pours black with a dark brown head. Head retention is good.   Smell: It has strong aromas of coffee and roast. There are dark fruits low in the background with a slight hint of vanilla.   Taste: It has strong flavors or roast and coffee that produces quite a bit of bitterness. There are low levels of dark fruit with low levels of burnt flavorings. The vanilla is a little stronger in the flavor than the aroma.   Feel: It has a full body and is quite bitter. There is a tinge of harshness in the initial flavor that eases throughout the tasting experience.   Overall, a very good imperial stout with strong coffee and roast flavors.","  rDev L: Pitch black with a foamy light brown head. Good retention. Spotty lacing is left behind.  S: Intense coffee, bordering on green pepper/chipotle. Subtle smoke. Dark chocolate, cacao, burnt toast, mild alcohol warmth.  T: Big pop of bitter chocolate, burnt toast, and burnt sugar upfront. Followed immediately by waves of coffee. First fresh coffee grounds, and then green pepper vegetal flavors, chili pepper spice, and wood smoke. The bitterness and roast lingers, with a subtle warmth going down.  F: Medium-plus--not creamy, thick, or chewy, but smooth and slick. Well carbonated. Leaves the palate slightly sticky.  O: A world-class imperial coffee stout. Perfect for those who prefer bitter stouts.","  rDev From the back label:  BOTTLED ON: 2018-05-04 12:46 LOT:160   Appearance: It pours an oily black into a pitch black body. The head is medium-large and settles at a medium height with amazing retention. It has a creamy textured khaki head. It is picture perfect.  Aroma: It has a very nice coffee aroma with just a bit of a burnt wood scent in the background and a light aroma of caramel.  Taste: Coffee comes through at first and it is quickly joined with this carbon flavor like steak char. It has a nice roasted, burnt character to it which works very nicely with the earthy coffee flavors. It has a bit of a smoky aftertaste. After a while of drinking the beer it also starts to pick up a bit of that pepper flavor that sometimes comes from coffee.  Mouthfeel: It is smooth and easy to drink with a full body and a clean, dry finish. It is very easy to drink and it sits very well on the palate. The more the beer is consumed the more the quality is appreciated on the palate.  Overall: This is a very enjoyable beer that has been dialed in exquisitely. It is a very simple and well executed coffee imperial stout that leaves you wanting for nothing, except another glass. It is a very memorable beer that will leave a lasting impression on the drinker. Years later I can still recall the first time I had this beer and it has never failed to impress since that time. I will continue to drink this and I would highly recommend it to others.","  rDev Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smell is dominated by roasted coffee and malt, with hints dark chocolate, tobacco and spice. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by slightly sweet roasted coffee and malt, with hints of dark, bitter chocolate, toffee and tobacco. There are also subtle notes of dark fruit and and spice: nutmeg, vanilla, along with a certain earthy character and a light smokiness. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and low carbonation.  Quite complex and well-balanced. Even though the coffee flavour is huge, it's not overpowering and there are a lot more subtle nuances to this. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a lot of those subtle notes, especially the spice, tobacco and earthiness are actually from the coffee itself, rather than the malt/hop bill.","  rDev Poured from a bottle dated 4-27-16.  The beer pours black with a very thin, tan head that disappated quickly leaving a ring and minimal lacing.  The smell hit me with sour milk and milk chocolate immediately. As it warmed up there was coffee and baker's chocolate.  The taste is very dark chocolate, coffee, dark malt, and a hint of the sour milk that minimizes as it warms. The coffee flavor is slightly burnt espresso.  The mouthfeel is medium carbonation, a medium/thick feel with a lingering tongue coating and long finish.  Overall, this is not what I was expecting after hearing so many great things about this beer. It's still very good, but the coffee is a bit overpowering and slightly burnt.","  rDev Poured from a single-serve bottle into a stemmed stout glass  Black, black, black is the color of this brew. Opaque, inky, oily, black. The head is tan and restrained but solid and gives way swiftly to foam and lace. This is a fabulous imperial stout.  Bitter chocolate and strong bitter coffee (as in espresso) notes hit the nose immediately in equal measure, though the coffee comes just behind and is the lasting aromatic impression. Toasted, just this side of burnt malt notes independent of the coffee/chocolate come through with just a hint of booze in the background. And there is a ton of the aromas that are there.  After the bitter presentation of the aroma, the flavor is an unexpected revelation. The espresso aroma belies a somewhat rounder dark-roast java note mixed with chocolate again, but only slight bitter notes. Brownie-batter mixed with semi-sweet chocolate nibs join the party. Licorice root and molasses that weren't evidenced in the nose are ample in the flavor; and the booze is there to warm everything up. As the brew warms, hints of darker fruit (cherry?) and hop bitterness arrive. There are many things going on here, and they are all fantastic.  The mouthfeel is very thick, and nearly  sticky  and  heavy,  and yet it never quite tips over that line. There is just enough bitterness, just enough booziness, just enough hop, and just enough char to keep things solid. If there had been just a touch more carbonation, this would have been stupendous.   Overall, a deceptively drinkable heavy-hitter imperial that keeps the drinker guessing and experiencing throughout. A must try if you haven't.","  rDev It pours jet black and very viscous with a small tan head that does not stick around for all that long but one that leaves a lovely lace behind. The aroma is just pure concentrated espresso coffee. The taste is equally espresso-like but supported by fair amount of malt sweetness. Lots of burnt notes. Full mouthfeel and with little carbonation.","  rDev Bottled 12/29/2016, 6 months young and it pours pitch black color with a huge sturdy 2-3 finger tan/sand colored head that was packed with bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving outstanding lacing as it went down. After a few minutes the head was a 1/2 finger foamy layer on top that I could run my fingers through and the lace left rings as it went down. Golf clap.   Is this my morning Starbucks or a coffee stout - either way the smells is delicious, with burnt coffee grinds, fresh ground coffee, whole coffee beans, roasted malt, charred wood, ash, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, anise or licorice and toasted pumpernickel bread. Says on the bottle  Imperial Stout brewed with coffee  and that is exactly what you get. Some may nitpick on the coffee dominating, but to me it's perfectly executed and has an outstanding aroma.  Flavor picks up right where the nose left off: bold black coffee (like Starbucks Sumatra or French Roast, Kona even), smoke, char or ash and all things roasted, toasted grains, cocoa powder, a sharp acidic bitterness, dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate syrup, very burnt bread crust, brownie batter, more chocolate, light nutty notes and some metallic hints. A cornacopia of dark roast coffees and the associated fresh ground coffee beans are the star of this brew, with the malt backbone and a small display of piney hops adding to the mix. The bitterness level is high but enjoyable and fades off quickly like wasabi. One of the best tasting coffee stouts that I've ever had, I'd even place this along side the barrel aged giants because for me it was that good.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied which could be considered light for an imperial stout, but this had some texture and gritty aspects as it slid across my tongue. The bitterness was high but enjoyable, the carbonation on the flat side, but this had some much flavor and malty goodness that I sipped and savored each drop. A world class stout, highly recommended.","  rDev 6/26/17 (Chicago): 11.5 oz bottle poured into snifter. Pitch black pour with one finger tan head and mild lacing. Strong bitter coffee aroma. Excellent bitter coffee, dry roasted malt balanced by sweet chocolate taste. Thin texture, no carbonation, easy smooth drinking. Nice after dinner drink, has a good kick. Love this beer!","  rDev From Bierkraft. In Teku glass. Playing Void &amp; Meddler. Nice coffee profile,notorious yet not excessive.Lighter body than other coffee stouts,less creamy,quicker drinkable. Some herbal hops at end","  rDev Brasserie Dieu du Ciel! Péché Mortel, 9.5% ABV. Pours thin and black with no head. Nose is coffee and roast malt, taste follows, with hardly any bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall outstanding.I like the strong coffee taste without strong bitterness.","  rDev A - Pours black with a thin tan head. Heavy amount of soay lacing.  S - Aroma is roasted malts, espresso and milk chocolate.  T - The taste follows the aroma. Bitter black coffee upfront followed by roasted malts and some light milk chocolate sweetness.   M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Soft creamy mouthfeel with a dry crisp finish.  O - This is an exceptional coffee stout and highly recommended for coffee lovers.","  With over 5 times as many ratings as the brewer's #2, it probably is safe to conclude this is a cash cow.  And as good as Peche Mortel is, I cannot believe there are 70 American Imperial Stouts rated ahead of it. While I've seen an AIS look like this before and while the coffee/chocolate aromas meld well, I may not have tasted one as smooth as Peche Mortel. It is as rich in the mouth as an RIS ... and the alcohol is subdued.  I shied away from this because I don't like to think about Mortal Sins when I'm enjoying an ale... particularly when it accompanies a rich chocolate dessert I just had ! By being so cautious, look what I missed.... and what I hope to Have again.","  rDev Nice dark appearance. What a wonderful coffee flavor. very strong aroma. This is one of the best coffee beers that I have had. There is no uniting for the coffee. It is excellent.","  rDev Poured into a snifter. Jet-black with a modest light tan head that slowly settled into a wispy cap. Aromas of fresh roasted coffee, cocoa, dark cherries, and toast. A rich-tasting beer with copious amounts of roasty malt, dark bread, coffee, and a milk-chocolate finish. Full-bodied but not too sweet. Great stout.","  rDev Shiny Orc's blood with a tan, creamy, dense head.  Smell is really chocolately at first, with roasted nuts and smokey malt too. It then develops to an almost oaky smell. THEN a more fruity coffee aroma emerges as it warms further, and this wasn't fresh. To think the bouquet I might get when it's right off the line.  Taste is roasty, almost smoked malt. Then chocolate comes in--both dark chocolate and malted milk balls. A woody taste then develops, and slowly the nutty coffee emerges.  Feel is kind of thin with minimal froth, finishing semi-dry. The thinness is surprising considering the depth of roast and color.  I really want a fresh one of these. As it warms, this is the most rapidly changing beer I think I've had over such a short period of time. And it manages to accomplish this in an enjoyable way.","  rDev Pitch black color with a thick thin dark caramel head with short retention. Assertive aroma with predominant notes of roasted coffee beans, Belgian chocolate and licorice. Flavor with notes of bitter coffee, a bit of lactic acid, cocoa powder, vanilla, plums, a good deal of hops, mild char, cigar, blueberries, molasses and black currant. Quite dry and bitter aftertaste with a lasting roasted note.  Velvety medium to full body with mild carbonation with tiny bubbles. Alcohol of 9.5% is very well disguised. Hoppy and bold Coffee RIS with true coffee notes and good dark complexity. Well attenuated, which contributes to show well its dark side."]},{"Name":"Choklat (Blackwater Series)","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/40058/","Brewery":"Southern Tier Brewing Company","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":10.00,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev 650 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11.0%. Pitch black colour, moderate creamy tan head. Intense aroma of cocoa / chocolate. The flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa, but the sweetness is not too extreme. Also some roasted coffee notes. A moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish (Chinook and Willamette) balances some of the chocolate sweetness. Very drinkable for an 11% beer. I had no problem finishing the bottle - but if you hate chocolate, this is clearly not a beer for you.","  rDev 22oz bottle. No dating information found. Black colored body, with ruby back lit highlights. Two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap. Leaves very little lacing. Aroma is similar to a chocolate malt. Smells very sweet. Taste is sweet but also bittersweet, and with a little smoky char. Displays many types of chocolate, from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate. Roasted malts are there for support. Mouth feel is about medium, but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. Good carbonation. This is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate, fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. Ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience.","  rDev Pours a brown so deep it appears to be shoe polish black. Garnet colored when bright light is passed through it. The pour produces a strong finger of foamy, moderately lasting, mocha head that leaves a rounded surface cap, a respectable collar ring and a pasty wash of lace 1/2 inch above the collar. The presentation is above average for a higher octane Imperial Stouts. Aroma is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate... deeply roasted malts, with hints of toffee, spice, prunes and a little alcohol booze. Taste is even more chocolate. Rich dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate syrup, chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate pudding, vanilla (like Oreos and milk), something nutmeg-like and alcohol spice. Puts me in mind of a deeply chocolate eggnog (if there is such a thing). There is little alcohol booze (for the ABV) and a faint hint of dark fruit. Velvety smooth in the finish it has almost no prickle between the finish and aftertaste but the hint is there. The aftertaste is earthy, chocolate, slightly bitter, roasted and burnt. Alcohol is evident as spice, warmth, flavor and maybe bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, smooth... velvety smooth, tongue coating creamy and chewy with a very thin peppery prickle.","  rDev Look: It pours black with a dark brown head. Head retention is moderate.   Smell: The initial aroma is a strong deep dark chocolate aroma. It reminds me of a brownie as it warms a bit.   Taste: This has a rich malt flavor with dark chocolate and cocoa. There is some roast and some slight burnt flavors. There is a bit of cherry in the background as well. Dark fruits are very low.   Feel: It has a rich, velvet like texture that is smooth and creamy. It has a moderate amount of bitterness to it.   Overall, it is a very rich, chocolate beer. The dark chocolate is the dominate flavor of the beer with some supporting elements in the background.","  rDev Pours pitch black with an extremely tin tan ring of head and virtually no lacing. Smells like chocolate milk with roasted malts. Taste lives up to the name as it is a chocolate bomb with both milk and dark chocolate present as well as a touch of bakers chocolate, molasses and roasted malts. Medium bodied, very lightly carbonated, smooth and creamy mouth feel with a slightly dry and bitter chocolate finish.","  rDev Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay with okay lacing left behind. Aroma is lovely milk and dark chocolate swirled together. There is a dash of dry, baker's chocolate as well. Flavor profile is one smooth chocolate bar. Toasted and roasted malts up front with an emphasis on smooth, buttery toasted malts. There is a hint of milk chocolate at the start that swells and grows generating a chocolate milk like flavor profile at the finish. Splendid smoothness throughout. Mouth feel is medium in thickness, with a buttery smooth, and creamy texture. Overall, a well crafted dessert beer. Despite being made as a dessert, it is still smooth throughout the flavor profile, delivering tasty chocolate notes along the way.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Almost solid black, medium light carbonation. Nice creamy solid feel,great bidy. Aroma is bakers bitter chocolate, molasses,raisins, and a bread/yeast smell. Taste is identical, high abv is warming but it doesn't dominate the flavor. I really enjoyed it for what it was, a very good dessert beer","  rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into a speiglau stout glass.   Look is a pitch black with a tan head.   Aroma is light malt, but not much chocolate.   Taste again is kinda subdued malt but no real malt or hops.","  rDev Well, I wasn't 100% sure I wanted this beer considering g a couple bad chocolate beers I've had in the past. However, I decided to go for it and am glad I did. Pours Uber dark brown, opaque, with a creamy medium head that sticks around and leaves a creme ring and spotty lace. Nose is a damn Hershey bar. They didn't go half ass or try for a melding of stout smells...it is straight up chocolate bar. Okay, I get some nice vanilla as well and maybe (maybe) some roasty and plum fruit notes, but not much. Taste is mellow, rich, and of course chocolatey. Fortunately, it doesn't come off as weird either. Overall, a really good beer.","  rDev S: Very dark brown. A very stable head that remains for a good ways through the session. Takes a flatter, glistened tone over time.   A: Hershey's Chocolate World is not a far stretch. If you haven't had the pleasure of stepping into a macro chocolate factory, I imagine your local boutique could sub. Either way, a multi spectral aroma.  M: Full, soft...very sticky. Surprising bit of roast astringency.  T: All types of chocolate. Raisins, dark cherry. Vanilla bean, wood, and coffee finish","  rDev ** 02/29/12  AROMA: Chocolate (Duh),  LOOK: Thick Dark Black appearance with no Head.  TASTE: Sweet Chocolate, I see now on the bottle that bittersweet belgian chocolate is added to the already chocolate malt; a little syrupy…..dare I say too much chocolate.   Maybe ok for a Dessert Beer. ** 01/16/15  Giving this a 2nd try. Still overly sweet. Alcohol is masked well.  Maybe i was a little too harsh the first time, but I still think this is too sweet as most ST Blackwater seems to be.  2.90 up to 3.48.  **","  rDev From the 22 oz bomber in a snifter. This beastly brew pours a rugged coal black with a quickly dissipating head of light tan foam that settles to a thin ring and subtle lacing. Nose of bakers chocolate, subtle charred dark malts, coffee, and medium strong booze. Flavors exceed the nose with  strong booze laden dark chocolate candy that is lightly touched by cream and caramel with light char notes settling on the back with a zesty herbal  hop bitterness to bring it all together. Excellent mouth feel; low carbonation,  creamy, smooth, and warming with a bitter malt and warming booze finish.   Excellent---look forward to this every year.  Cheers","  rDev 22 oz bomber poured into my Central Waters snifter while on vacation in Wisconsin.   Deep dark obsidian black with a beige-brown 2 finger head. 100% opaque. Beautiful.  Smells like Hershey's syrup, very old Krackle bar, and slight metal.   Oh. This could have been so much better. It starts with a milisecond of chocolate and chocolate milk, but then it gets washed out by a burning, boozy flavor - vodka - that wrecks the whole thing. There's a touch of lactose, and heavy charred roast notes at the finish, with more of the boozy hotness. Leaving it on the palate a good ten seconds lifts some of those chocolate notes, but the boozy hottness is almost too much here. I'll give it a decent score here because there is character...it's just buried.   Feel is great, it's nice and thick without being chewy, but yes, very hot, and semi-dry on the finish.   Overall, somehow i knew it was too good to be true that Chokolat was like a Chocolate Bar in Stout form, and I was right. I'll continue the search. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but for those that are exclaiming too much sweetness...how did you find it beneath the alcohol?","  rDev Southern Tier Choklat Stout, 10% ABV, 65 IBU. Pours thick and black, with 2+ fingers of tan head, decent lacing. Nose is malt and chocolate. Taste is milk, chocolate, and a strong coffee bitter close, a bit tangy. Like their Creme Brulee, I find it overcarbonated which detracts from mouthfeel. Overall just OK, prefer Samuel Smith Organic Chocolate Stout, but like the Sam Smith I pick up some mineral bitterness.","  rDev Bottled on 10/27/15.  Pours opaque near black with a half-inch tan head that quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. The smell is of milk chocolate, vanilla, earthy hops and a hint of booze. The taste follows with sweet chocolate up front and subtle bitterness on finish. Medium-to-thick texture.","  rDev  The Pupol Vuh, the sacred book of the Maya, unfolds a complex web of mystery around a beverage known as xocoatl. We're not surprised that ancient hieroglyphs depict chocolate being poured for rulers &amp; gods. Cacao is a mystical bean. Choklat is every bit a dessert beer, encompassing the complexity of the darkest, bittersweet candy together with that of the original frothy beverage. We combine the finest ingredients to tempt your senses &amp; renew the power &amp; interrelation of history in every bottle.  Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout brewed with chocolate. Annual release in 22 oz. bottles and recently, 12 oz. bottled 4 packs. fall 2014 vintage reviewed alongside a winter 2013 vintage for a vertical comparison.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.  (Appearance) Pours a smooth, foamy head of a light creamy brown shade over a very dark brown, near black body. Retention is very good and lacing is light and spotty. 4.25  (Smell) Lightly sweetened chocolate syrups, cocoa nibs, chocolate malts coalesce for a very chocolate-heavy aroma upfront. Underneath lies a subtle caramel and pale malt filling, subtle but decadent. Little earthy or hop bitterness present, leaning this beer towards intentionally sweet, but not cloyingly so. Potency is moderate. 4  (Taste) Smooth pale malt and caramel bread body with some moderate earthy roastiness and a lesser chocolate delivery than in the aroma, a bit better balanced than in the aroma but notably missing sweetness in the balance, and the earthy qualities of this beer go unchallenged. Finishes lightly roasty and bitter, but clean and smooth. The lightness and accessibility of the body make this stout easy drinking, but its simplicity doesn't keep it all too interesting. 3.75  (Mouthfeel) Texture is smooth, silky, lightly chewy, moderately dry. Carbonation is light, generating a medium frothiness and a lightly crisp finish. Body is shy of medium for the style, medium/heavy overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to earthy bitter. Alcohol presence is light and there are no off characters. 4  (Overall) Overall a respectable dessert beer that doesn't really have the boldness to hold out beyond the season. A nice beer if you favor the subtleties and range of chocolate flavor, you will get much more than just chocolate syrup and chocolate malts in here. Not too bad, but not as enjoyable a beer as Southern Tier's other imperial stout choices. 3.75  Southern Tier Brewing Company's Choklat: A Stout Brewed with Chocolate 3.87/5.00  2013 vintage (2 years, 7 months aged): Pour is a slight shade darker than its more recent vintage, equal froth and smoothness, a tad darker even. Aroma is very similar as well, although the chocolate is a bit smoother and more subtle in its delivery, and bitter nutty characters are a bit easier to detect on the surface. This vintage's flavor is a bit better rounded, with more preserved sweetness which better calls attention to the addition of chocolate, while keeping a respectable earthy bitterness in the background. Texture is smooth, slick, silky, lightly chewy, mildly dry. Carbonation is very subtle, with a delicately crisp finish. Body, balance and alcohol presence are nearly the same as in the fresh vintage. Overall this beer does a decent job at holding out with time while not developing any particularly interesting qualities that justify its cellaring.  Recommended Vintage: Fresh, although with the newer 4 packs you shouldn't be too bothered about forgetting a bottle or two.","  rDev The beer pours a nice creamy light tan head that dissipates fairly quickly and the nucleation point only creates a thin film on the surface. The beer itself is very nice and appealing. The color is a nice chocolate black while the texture is slightly syrupy with a nice thickness that makes it look extremely appetizing.  The smell is very good bordering on wonderful. It has a very strong dark chocolate smell that definitely overwhelms the other notes and a cream sweetness that complements very well and keeps it from being too bitter. It's really good and comes off as a milky chocolate syrup.  The taste is P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. It has a nice sweet and lightly bitter chocolate note with a bit of cream from the barley flakes. The hops are by and large hidden or at the very least light enough not to notice. The taste also has a moderate caramel note from the malts that just make this beer freaking delicious.  The feel is just wow. It's a heavy bodied beer with some very light carbonation. The beer is fairly creamy smooth and a delight. It strongly resembles a smooth and less viscous syrup.  Overall, buy this freaking beer! I don't normally like Southern Tier but my god this beer is divine. Get it. Now. Stop reading this review and buy a four pack!!! I mean IT!!","  rDev on tap at knickerbockers in Altoona pa. brought to the table in a half pint glass.  black body with small off white head which dissipated quite quickly.  aroma was really pleasing to a sweet tooth chocoholic like me. strong chocolate aromas.   taste, well, the heavily roasted malts kinda overwhelmed the chocolate a bit. while some might enjoy this a lot, i was left wishing they were a little less roasted.   feel was on the thin side of medium.  overall, a decent enough beer, would likely get again.","  rDev Initial look, aromas were amazing. Milk chocolate abounds and was excited to drink. Taste was great with a nice earthiness, lots of chocolate, subdued coffee and a sweet lactose feel. After that, and as the beer warmed, the bitterness took over and skewed tha balance and took away from the initial excitement","  rDev I tend not to indulge in the chocolate beer scene, but glad I did here. Looks inviting, but the smell lets me know that chocolate belongs in this ale. The taste is on the bitter, oily side; but balanced. (That's the way I like my coffee, too.) Mouthfeel? Smooth and totally unaware that this is 11%. Try this beer if you want to get to Chocolate Heaven. And if you want to go back again, buy two bottles.","  rDev Bottle (DOB 10/22/15) into pint glass. Pours like used motor oil - dead black, thick and viscous. Light brown head. Initial impression is (d'oh) dark bittersweet chocolate. Like liquid chocolate cake icing. There's a tiny bit of hops in the finish, but not much. Thick mouthfeel. Light carbonation. Alcohol is not at all evident.  This is not a beer that I could take in large doses, but it sure is fun as an occasional indulgence.","  rDev Picked up a bomber from Craft Beer Hop Stop on Veteran's Day for $10.99. Bottled on 10/27/15.  Beer poured black with a nice tan head that has some hang time.  Nose is of dark cocoa but kind of different...hard to describe.  Taste is bitter dark cocoa well played into a mildly roasted malt base. There is enough hopping to balance things out nicely.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth.  Overall a very nice beer that is fine as the beer of the night or paired with something chocolatey for dessert!","  rDev 12oz bottle - DOB 10/22/15, 2:12PM. Served in a snifter.   Appearance: Black with no light coming through. Thin dark tan head with some occasional strands of lacing that slowly slid back down the glass.   Smell: Exactly like a rich medium percentage-cacao content dark chocolate bar, with a nice underlying sweetness. With a swirl there is some hint of alcohol in the nose.   Taste: Very rich. Bittersweet chocolate at the start and finish, with a solid rich sweetness in the middle. Some coffee notes as well. Bitterness at the finish does take on some herbal/leafy qualities, but mixed in with the bitterness you would get from a very high cacao content dark chocolate bar. Pretty obvious that this beer lives up to its name.   Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy with just right carbonation. Definitely coats the mouth and teeth.   Overall / Drinkability: As often with this brewery - a rich sweet full flavored dessert in a bottle, but definitely still an American Imperial Stout. So good I wish I had the 22oz bomber rather than the 12oz bottle, but this beer is quite good and is definitely worth having again. Very good by itself as a slow sipping and savoring beer, but would be good with a steak or burger. Definitely a beer for those with a sweet tooth, like me!","  rDev Pours black with decent tan head I get some finger lacing but the head goes away mostly. Smell dark sweet chocolate you can smell some of the alcohol little smells like a chocolate brownie. Taste well is amazing sweet dark chocolate of course a little of the alcohol comes through just enough to enjoy again very dessertlike  Feel fairly thick very smooth going down little burn from the alcohol. Overall an excellent beer perfect balance of chocolate and alcohol.","  rDev Poured into a Saint Somewhere wine-style glass. No freshness date.  A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light brown head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a large center patch of sheer surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind.  S- Smells like straight Hershey's syrup covered in crumbled walnuts.   T- Fudge, hot chocolate, malted milk balls. All the decadent chocolate notes are there with minimal alcohol flavor considering the ABV. There's also some caramel, vanilla, peanut brittle and a hint of coffee. Bitter roast aftertaste. The sweetness is definitely there the whole way through the glass but it never gets too overbearing (for my taste at least).  M- Creamy and luscious with medium-low carbonation and the fullest of bodies.   O- The ultimate chocolate dessert beer. You have to like sweet stuff to appreciate it but, if you do, you definitely want this.","  rDev Old bottle, old label. Black as liquid, flimsy beige pour that doesn't substantiate itself. Aroma was dark, bitter chocolate .   Taste was more bitter chocolate, not sugary type, we're talking rich, dark bitter chocolate, solid malt bill, alcohol regulated well, impactful chocolate mouthfeel. You had one job and you delivered. This and Rogue Double Chocolate/Single Stout make up that echelon of Chocolate beers right below the grandaddy of them all, Chocolate Rain.","  rDev Dark brown with a small, tan frothy head.  Chocolate is not as prominent on nose as I thought, with toffee and caramel coming in just as or even more strongly. There is even a good amount of malt and hops present, with the malt giving off a spent grain aroma. Not a sweetness bomb like most Southern Tier.  Taste is slightly bitter chocolate, not too sweet, with a frothy, light, tangy body.","  rDev DATE TASTED: December 19, 2015 ... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... OCCASION: finished the first round of gift wrapping... APPEARANCE: black as, er, Blackwater (?), with a thin, brown head that shows a creamy, resilient half-finger staying power; lacing slides in sheets... AROMA: overpowering sweetness born of chocolate, toasted malts, licorice, toffee, and subdued hops--but holy, heavenly chocolate, suggesting confectioner's kitchens or the M&amp;M Mars factory... PALATE: creamy as the head suggests; full-bodied, warming and active at the teeth...the aftertaste is formidable and welcome... TASTE: chocolate, sweet and pronounced, with toffee and vanilla...robust is an understatement...like a cake or mousse liquefied.... the toasted elements evoke a smoked cheese,,,... OVERALL: I had this on draft at The Corner Pub, and I had to revisit it...at home from a 22 oz. bomber, it only stands taller and more formidable, encompassing the palate and demanding every inch of attention with each sip--a BIG beer... phenolic in a highly drinkable,fashion...","  rDev L: Jet black with a thick tan head S: not a ton on the nose, some bakers chocolate T: not as sweet as I remembered from a few years ago, the various chocolate (dark, bitter, etc) soften the roasted malts F: thick and creamy O: I'm glad I revisited this one","  rDev I had this beer for lunch, maybe I should have had it for dessert! It has an incredible chocolate signature, very smooth, very drinkable and it packs a big punch!","  rDev On tap at Black Friday. Velvety smooth, aroma confirms beer namesake, flavor brings it all to fruition. Chocolate essence abounds, very smooth despite the high ABV.

According to the stamp on the can, this was canned on  03.09. 200019034.  Apparently, Founders has an in-house time machine, and this beer was retrieved from the era the Dune books are set in.  Poured into a Mad Bomber IPA glass, this had a nice, but, fluffy, beige colored head that sat on top of a dark copper, slightly red colored beer with some nice clarity. Said head took a long time to drop and left lots of lace behind.   Peppery, spicy Amarillo hop and rye malt notes greeted the workers at my olfactory. Some sweet, bready malt notes as well.  Taste is spicy and peppery up front. Earthy, Rye malt flavor comes to the fore especially at the fadeout. Fairly good-sized, bready malt backbone to this, which isn't surprising given it's midwest DNA, but is not sufficiently massive to be disturbing to a PNWer like me!   Medium bodied, with an almost creamy mouthfeel.  Really like this. If it were local to me I'd have it in my fridge on a regular basis. Thanks, Whyteboar!","  rDev From old, undated notes. Had this on draft.   Murky orange rust hue.   Tan head; minimal lace.   Skunky weed &amp; grapefruit nose; hint of caramel.   Thick mouthfeel.   Grapefruit with a hint of caramel; viscous but enjoyable.","  rDev Now I'm trying to figure out a blind tasting, courtesy of a @foundersasap in our NBS BIF #9  I am a little baffled by this one.  It's a garnet tinged amber color. Light sandy head that rises a finger or so, loosens up, and quickly recedes. (I'm assuming it would have a little more head retention had I opened earlier). Really pretty color. Smells of rye, some earthy hops, and a hint of caramel malt. Taste is rye, buckwheat, a tad of pine resin, with a gentle almost floral honey note. Also a smooth pepper note peeks in. Mouthfeel is slightly less than medium. Low carbonation. Finish is a tad slick. Overall, I'm guessing a rye IPA, or an Amber ale with some rye in the mix. So what is it?","  rDev From notes 10/31/11: Pours a hazy amber producing 2 fingers of beige head. It leaves nice lacing as it recedes. Aroma is spicy rye, brown sugar and caramel balanced with the hops. Taste is sweet, spicy rye, caramel malt, toffee, with earthy herbal, grapefruit, pine and grass hints. It has a fine bitter/spicy finish. Complex.","  Tap pour at Buster's on 28th (Mpls MN) Amber brown colored body. One finger tan head. Leaves a few thin rings of lacing. Not much aroma, mostly rich malt. The taste is where this beer really shines. Combines the rich malt, solid floral hops, and the spice from the rye. Solid combination of flavors. Medium, creamy mouth feel.  When distributed in a bottle, this was my favorite rye IPA. It is always a treat when this can be found again, and here it is presented on tap at the very friendly Buster's on 28th. Kudos to the brewer and to the server.","  rDev Deep rich red appearance with nice white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is very mild. Taste is also very mild with only a hint of hops. In general great mild flavor and refreshing.","  rDev Nicely pleasantly surprised by this beer, tried on tap. Nice dark amber color with small amount of head, trace lingering lacing. Smells of floral hops, tastes of hops with some citrus, malt biscuit, faint hints of caramel. Thin mouthfeel with some mild carbonation throughout. An excellent easy-to-drink IPA.","  rDev 32oz growler filled last night poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp. The beer pours bright reddish brown with khaki colored head. The head recedes to a cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma offers a hint of rye and some citrus. The taste is multifaceted rye ranging from spicy to caramel to bready. It's complex enough to seem like a different beer on sequential sips. Hop bitterness is there just for balance and perhaps lending a bit of citrus and pine. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, excellent. It's a shame this is draft only now outside the brewery. Very enjoyable. Recommended for fans of rye.","  rDev (From notes taken at the Hop Cat in Ann Arbor.) Poured from draft into a pint glass, a clear golden red with excellent head and lacing.

Pours thin and medium red with a finger of white foamy head that dissipated quickly and left some lacing.

Bottle exploded upon opening though it had just sat perfectly still in my fridge for over 48 hours. As a result the beer was very flat.  09/15/2012 RE-RATED LATER: Upped ratings after 2nd-6th beers were better, still a lot of sediment and low carbonation, but smoother feel when the experience doesn't start with a bang and a face full of foam.  **","  rDev Comes in darker than red, light brown. 3/4  head with substantial retention. Aroma was not as hoppy as amarillos usually are, the rye tempered this a little methinks.   Taste was solid amount of rye, bready. Hopped up, but not into ipa territory I thought. Plenty of caramel and rye all over this. One of those 2nd tier rye hoppy beers for sure. Good, not great.","  rDev Draught pour at Davis Beer Shoppe into a nonic pint. Pours a gorgeous amber brown with 1.5 fingers of high density light tan head that did not dissipate quickly and left a sheet of lacing. Nose was a little mute, sweetness possibly from caramel malt, spicy from the rye. Loved the taste, lots of spice with pleasant but not overwhelming hop character. Mouthfeel was very good, carbonation spot on, and the finish has a hint of bitterness in a sea of spicy. This is a great example of a red rye IPA done right!

The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An  arrogant  beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!","  rDev Reviewed from notes.  Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.  The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.  The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.  Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer  feels good .  Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done.","  rDev From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The  oaking  process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original. Starts hoppy and bittersweet but immediately increases in bitterness to finish dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lingers long in the aftertaste.","  rDev ** 06/01/2013  Aroma is pure hops and barley. Dark copper color, but translucent. Small white head. Thin feel. Low carbonation. A bit too strong and bitter, though I think the oaked version of this beer us a touch smoother than the original. Some good flavors, but all over the place.

High ABV masked by the smoky bitterness.","  rDev Appearance: Deep clear dark amber with a moderate, slightly coarse off-white head, withthin lacing, which leaves irregular tidemarks.   Aroma: Prominent notes of sweet malt, somewhat earthy and herbal hops and prominent oak notes. There is a prominent undercurrent of sweet and spicy alcohol.  Taste: Opens with strong toasted and caramel malts, soon followed by strong herbal hops and sweet alcohol. The oak barrels contribute prominent and strong earthy, wood-infused flavors. The sweet alcohol lingers throughout, and along with the oak, forms the backbone of the taste. Finishes with a persistent, lingering earthy hop note.  Mouth feel: Smooth and full, very soft, with faint carbonation.  Drinkability/notes: A rich and elegant beer, to be consumed with reverence.

F: Medium body, medium carbonation","  rDev 650 mL bottle included in the Bastard Box that hit LCBOs last month. Bottled Oct 8 2015 and best enjoyed by Jan 7 2016. Served slightly chilled.  Looks a lot like standard Bastard - foggy copper-amber hue with brick red highlights, and equipped with a nearly one-inch crown of creamy, buff-coloured head. Great retention; it lasts the better part of ten minutes before receding completely, coating the glass with a messy layer of lacing as it steadily creeps ever downward. A lumpy cap and generous collar survive afterwards. Looks perfect to me, but the aroma is comparatively humble - light notes of buttery oak and vanilla come through, with the remainder being a toned-down derivative of the base beer. Bready, toasty malt and toffee/caramel sweetness, with additional notes of pine resin, citrus and dried orchard fruit.  This strong ale has a familiar backbone consisting of lightly toasted bready malts and toffee sweetness, combining with a hint of prune fruitiness. The hops rush in on the back end, providing that intense bitterness you've come to expect from this brand: oily pine resin and pithy grapefruit citrus. Finishes with floral notes, ethanol and woody oak chip flavours that dry the palate out almost completely, leaving an astringent feeling on the tongue. Medium-bodied, with middling carbonation levels that gently prickle the palate, resulting in a relatively soft, creamy mouthfeel.   Final Grade: 4.27, a high A-. Oaked Arrogant Bastard is more of a sideways step than a forward one - it's a very nice beer, but IMO I'm not sure if the oak chips really improved it much. The relentless resiny bitterness and bold grapefruit citrus flavours are still there, as is the equally-sturdy malt backbone. The oak chips serve mostly to dry the finish out considerably, playing mostly a supporting role in the flavour profile itself. I encourage everyone who enjoyed the standard Bastard to give this one a shot, as it's certainly a good variant on a rock-solid theme.","  rDev Pours mahogany red-brown, with a thick creamy khaki colored head. Smells like dark caramel, oak, vanilla, pineapple, coconut, fruity light citrus, and grassy hops.

That's about it for this one for me. The smell is uninspired with a mouthfeel that was carbonated and astringent.

T: Spicy rye comes right out, as well as some resinous pine, then it opens up its fruity side, a little citrus, grapefruit, lime, and orange, apricot, plum, dark berries, and passion fruit, some earthy herbal notes, maybe even a hint of oak, all held together with a complex malty backbone, bready, toasty, slightly roasty notes, faint chocolate and coffee, and toffee sweetness.   M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, ever so slightly creamy.   O: The last time I had this was probably the last year they put it out in 6 packs, which was before I joined BA. Really happy to have it back, if only as a rare seasonal. Excellent rye beer!","  rDev L: Clear dark amber/light brown with a creamy off white head. Long lasting retention, and sheets of lacing.  S: Toasted rye bread, black pepper, fennel, cumin, grapefruit peel, ruby red grapefruit flesh, and pine needle.  T: Grapefruit zest and flesh upfront, juicy and citrusy, followed by a large malt backbone of toasty pumpernickel bread with herbs and spices. Cumin, fennel, black pepper and chive. Plentiful rye flavor. Finishes lightly dry and moderately bitter, piney with lingering resin and citrus pith.  F: Medium, creamy carbonation, slick and slightly oily--finishes dry with a slight lingering stickiness.  O: Excellent rye IPA! A perfect blend of West Coast IPA with massive rye flavor.","  rDev Appearance - Pours deep brown color with big fluffy tan head. Spotty lacing all around the glass.  Aroma - Floral hops, spicy rye, touch of malt, little sweet caramel.  Taste - Taste is really balanced, getting some malt and a little floral hops up front. Sweet caramel and peppery rye and then bitter citrus rind on the finish.  Feel - Medium bodied, well carbonated, touch of dryness on the finish.  Overall - Not always a fan of rye IPAs but this one has nice flavors and is really well balanced.","  rDev Pours an opaque, maroon with a thin, creamy white head. Smells of wonderful combination of rye and citrus hop. Great rye presence that balances well with red malts and hop. Good peppery spice. Bitterness resinates.","  rDev A: crystal clear; amber in color; 2 finger light beige head that receded to a thin cap; OK lacing;  S: grain and a little rye spice;  T: malt and spice from start to finish; moderate bitterness at the end;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; lightly dry finish;  O: not as good as I remember; other than bitterness, there was no hop character;","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle, from the Fall Pack. Bottled on '07/13/18'. Clear, medium amber brown colored body. One finger, slightly off white head settles to interrupted cap and ring. Leaves behind some larger spots of lacing. Spicy in the aroma, with slight citrus and malts. Taste expresses the spicy side of the rye, along with the floral and fruity hops, and the solid lightly roasted malts. Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation with slightly felt tongue burn. Has a full after taste of the rye spice and the hops. Another one of the beers that I bought on a regular basis when available in its own packaging. One of the first rye influenced beers I tried, along with Founders Red's Rye. Both of which are no longer available as a stand alone packaged beer. I like the rye spiciness. This bottling reminds me of what I enjoyed from years past. Smooth, well balanced, full of flavors, with the spicy kick. Awesome to be able to enjoy again. If you like the rye component in a IPA beer, I heartily recommend this one.","  rDev 12oz bottled 7/11/18 (27 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6.6% ABV. The beer pours bright red tinted rusty amber in color with prolific tan head. The head recedes to a cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is woody, earthy and spicy rye. The taste follows with peppery, woody earthy rye. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, very good. I loved this beer when it was a seasonal. Still one of the best rye beers out there.","  rDev Nicely done IPA with rye. Medium dark amber with thick fluffy off-white head. Just the right amount of bitterness, smooth palate, dry finish. This is a really good IPA.","  rDev 12 oz bottle (12/23/17) poured into an IPA glass. Glad to be able to get some SN extremely fresh in NC, thanks to great things happening out in Western NC. And glad to see this one return. Pours a dark amber orange, with a three finger white head that retains for great portion of the glass. The aroma is heavy pine and bread/rye. The taste is right in line with the nose, a good balance of rye/pine/malt. Medium level of carbonation and heft with a slightly bitter finish. A tasty easy drinking rye IPA.","  rDev ** 02/21/13  AROMA: is rye, hops, orange rind. LOOK: copper color. Big Head. TASTE: Bitter/stale Hops, rye.

Medium body, average carbonation. Sweet at first but with a bitter finish.Taste of caramel, malts, herbs, spices.","  rDev Pours a rudy crisp brown with a thin tan head that dissipated somewhat but left lots of lacing and a thin tan film on the beer.   Smell has some aromas of orange, peach and mango with an undertone of spicy rye and pepper. The rye and malts become more pronounced as the beer warms.   Taste has notes of orange, mango, and a fruit like character initially giving way to a strong malt flavor with lots of spicy rye notes. As the beer warms the malts and rye become more pronounced. Overall the spicy pepper and rye notes tend to overpower the hops. I would have appreciated a bit more balance.  Feel had medium carbonation, but heavy, sort of sweet.   Overall a solid rye IPA. The balance skewed towards the malts/rye flavors at the expense of the hop, but it was still a decent tasting brew.","  rDev Bright, clean, copper penny color with a 1/3  off white head on top. Falls to a 1/4  and retention there is great. Thick lacing left behind. Sweet malt, light orange peel/orange candy. Medium to full body, low to mid carbonation. Malt driven, spiciness comes thru mid to late, bittering hops are intense and linger on with the spiciness of the malt. Really good, part of a variety 12pk -- I would buy it on it's own.","  rDev 12oz bottle pkgd 01/28/16. Served in a pint glass. Beer pours an orange amber color, clear, but darker than expected for Sierra Nevada, supporting a very large head. I get very little in the way of aroma -- maybe a little bit of malty bread smell. Flavor brings the new-classic combination of rye bitterness and hops, in American Single IPA proportions. Piny, bready, with a slick, cloying mouthfeel. I'm having really mixed feelings about this one. This is clearly not my favorite rye IPA, but is it any good? Is it too simple? Is it simple because that's what its balance demands?","  rDev Pours a clear, vibrant Amber in color with a full two fingers of dense very light khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is very subdued, hints of caramel malt and a touch of breadiness. Taste is equally subdued but has a general underlying sweetness with some caramel and spicy rye with bready undertones and a slight bitterness in the finish. Medium+ mouthfeel with low-moderate carbonation. Overall a decent beer, easy drinking but not terribly interesting."]},{"Name":"Trois Pistoles","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22/30/","Brewery":"Unibroue","Style":"Strong Ale - Belgian Dark","Alcohol":9.00,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottle poured into a nonic  Brewers Notes: Drawing on Quebec folklore, Unibroue chose the name Trois Pistoles to honour the city’s historic importance and pay homage to the legend of the Black Horse.

The aroma is subdued (my beer is warming), but appetizing and a bit boozy. The taste is delicious malts and yeast. I don't think this sample is very old, but this style would age well.

Taste is cherry and date fruit, and some dark malt; this combo is sweet. Mainly at the end is the yeast, which dries out the palate through the after taste. Mouth feel is full. Some spiciness on the tongue. The higher ABV% does bring a boldness. Very good carbonation. Low bitterness.

The aroma screams Belgian Strong Dark Ale with notes of coriander (leading), dark fruits, dark malt and spicy yeast producing the main bouquet. Taste is and assault of dark fruits: plums, raisins, cherries and more with dark malt, coriander and a hint of floral hops rounding it out.

Transparency drops to null and the beer darkens a little when the final ounces of the bottle are poured into the glass. Head is two fingers of khaki foam and it retains remarkably well. Aroma is dark fruits, berries, grape jam, roasty, toasty, and nutty malts. Little pop of sweetness up front with a slightly more bitter, balanced finish. Flavor profile is grape jelly, dark fruits, berries, clove, a pinch of banana and nutty, toasty malts. It is sweet throughout, but never crosses the threshold into 'dessert' levels. Sweetness is waned away at the finish by the alcohol, which creates a soft and slow burn on the tongue and lips long after a sip. Mouth feel is thick with a frail graininess that breaks down into a soft, fuzzy carpet as the beer sits on the tongue. Overall, thick and lightly sweet with some nutty malts.

S: Tangy/tart with aromas of molasses, cherry wood, berries, and orange. T: Tart and semisweet. Flavor follows the nose this the addition of at least clove and cardamom. Bitterness keeps the sweetness and spiciness in line. M: Medium bodied with insane carbonation. O: Wow! Just a delicious, flavor forward, Belgian dark ale.

Mellow peppery esters followed by dark malt and and dark fruit flavors, raisin, and fig. Medium light, acidic bitterness through the middle followed by sweet banana and dark malt flavors.

The aroma offers hints of dark fruit and a subtle clovey Belgian yeast note. The taste is more clove, raisin, plum, sweet bread and spice. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. There is no noticeable bitterness with the balancing of the beer left to the unnamed spices referred to on the label. No alcohol presence in the aroma or taste. Overall, very good.

Taste is similar with with fig, raisin, spice, some biscuit malt, caramel and yeastiness. Its cleaner/thinner/dryer than many of this style but the flavors pleasant and get better with warmth.

Overall a very good beer, with clean/dry flavor and presence, more so than others in the style.","  rDev These Canadians can sure put out a beer...  I can describe this high ABV beer in a single word: Unique. It had a very unique look with the dark brown, red highlights and thick but quickly dissipating head - enough remained for lacing to be visible. Unique in smell as it did not have that overpowering boozy tang to the nose and for that matter on the mouth. Though I will admit, it started chugging it almost and then it hit and I had to slow down (I think Imma gonna sleepa gooda tonight...) Anyway, unique taste due to this light boozy background that hits you later, and hits you it does. A very good brew and a unique representative of the style.","  rDev Pours a dark brown with a two inch, fairly well retained tan head that left nice lacing.

This is a really damn good beer.","  rDev It pours very dark brown with a huge tan head. The retention is not great but there is some lacing left behind. This being a bottle conditioned beer I'm a bit surprised the bottle has a twist-off cap (albeit covered in foil).

Yeast,malt,and dried fruit aroma that comes off as very strong. Taste is identical to aroma with just a tiny but of bite from carbonation,high abv,and perhaps a small amount of hops.

The scent was also tantalizing as at just 7% ABV it was boozy to the nose as it was to the tongue - but balanced well, not overpowering.

Body/Overall: medium body","  rDev Cork and cage 25 oz bomber allowed to sit out of the 45° F beer refrigerator for about 10 minutes before opening. A substantial  pop  upon twisting the cork out after removing the cage. Poured about half the bottle (a little less) into a 16 oz goblet.  Aroma of dark bread, caramel, and spice. A bit of sweetness in the aroma, along with dark fruits, raisins. The aroma is complex and inviting.  Dark brown color on first look, with an amber-red with a back light, with abundant carbonation. Tall, thick, creamy, off-white head from a somewhat gentle pour. Thick lacing if you tip the glass that slips down just a bit toward the head once you put the glass back upright. As the head recedes, there will be some lacing lingering just above the thick cap on the side of the glass. As you drink, the opposite side of the glass has thick lacing reminding you of what you've just enjoyed.   Sweet bready taste, dominated by caramel, raisins/dates. The mix of caramel, bread, raisins, and spiciness is thoroughly delightful. The taste lingers nicely on the tongue, with just a slight touch of bitterness in the finish. By the finish, the sweetness has given way to a dry ending.  Feel is moderate, with substantial carbonation noted as well.  Aftertaste has the fruit, caramel, and spices lingering; very pleasant, indeed.","  rDev Pours a deep, dark amber coloration with a huge, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark/red fruits and estery spice notes, with just a hint of a certain earthiness. Taste is great balance of slightly toasted, bready, caramel malt, very light earthy/herbal hops and estery spice, with notes of dark/red fruit: fig, raisin, redcurrant, clove, black pepper and hints of leather and tobacco. Finishes semi-dry, with a light bitterness and some bready/caramel malt and earthy/spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This is a very close contender to Westmalle, with a good balance and complexity, never turning to sweet, but perhaps still being a tad more sweet and fruity, while somewhat more earthy and leathery at the same time.","  rDev 11.2oz bottle marked L18-427 (bottled roughly a year ago) poured into a Chimay chalice at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours bright dark amber to light brown in color with red highlights and light khaki head. The head builds quickly on a gentle pour, then recedes to a thin cap. Minimal lacing. The aroma is sweet resembling candi sugar and dark dried fruits with a bready element as well. The taste is semisweet caramel bread with a light fruitiness transitioning to a mildly bitter, drying finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation to the point of being barely prickly. Overall, very good. A timeless and delicious beer.","  rDev On tap into a chalice. A fairly hazy dark brown color. The head was beautiful - creamy, light tan, and persistent. This is my standard for Dubbels.

Just outstanding.","  rDev Well, sweet hell, BA’s - I’ve never had myself a Belgian Dubbel before, so I’m kind of jumping into this one a buck naked virgin.  Now, scurred of this bad beauty Raul is not. And Raul ain’t gonna call this one basic, but it kind of is. We got caramel like it was sponsored by a Snicker; we got fig and raisin and plum like it was endorsed by your grandpapa’s favorite laxative company; and then all that mellows out all kinds of simple and smooth.  It ain’t wild. It ain’t crazy. But you know what? It’s just good.   Peace!","  rDev Cannot believe I haven’t reviewed this before.  Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.

I’ve never had this one fresh, but I’m excited to try it regardless, especially for the Cellaruary thread. Let’s get into it  Pours a muddy dark brown with a finger of tan head that immediately fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing  It is pretty wild the complexity a Stout can have without barrel aging; everything speaks for itself without any distraction. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark toast, toffee, earthy bourbon, light roast coffee, and charred oak  I know the age and abv definitely play a role in bumping up the complexity and robustness of this beer, but it's an impressive thing regardless. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, black cherry, caramel, charred malt, dark bready malt, bourbon, light raisin, and a touch of red wine. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, rich red wine, charred malt, toffee, black cherry, and a touch of acidic coffee  A full body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a somewhat hot beer. Finishes off dry with a lightly tart fruitiness  This is solid stuff right here. I really can't believe I waited this long to try it. A far cry from the KBBS I had yesterday for review 1000, but a wonderful beer in its own right. Hopefully I can get a fresher bottle next time","  rDev 2016 bottle, cracked open in 2022.  A - Pours opaque, black with brown highlights. Minimal light tan head. Fades to a pencil thin line around the glass, no lacing.  S - A big nose of alcohol warmth, boozy and bourbon-like, vanilla and malts, roasted up nice.  T - Follows the nose, with a fat malty open, chocolate and dark fruits, vanilla and a subtly bitter finish.  M - This is such a big beer, not heavy for it, and more drinkable than I expected. Warm, minimal carbonation.  O - Superb. This is not my favorite type of stout. But incredibly well built. Great example of what can be done.","  rDev Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Black colour. Intense aroma of sweet malts, roasted barley, leather, liquorice and oak. Very sweet, alcoholic and roasty flavour with notes of molasses. Interesting, but overdone.","  rDev 12oz bottle, obcenely expensive, 3 years old  Almost black, cola edge, not much (if any) foam to speak of, smells like coffee beans, hops, and paint varnish. Very bitter and sweet, the coffee is bitter and sweet, the hops are bitter, the malt is honey-like in flavor and feel and sweetness (i.e. pure sugar). If I can describe the taste in cave-man terms -  chocolate sweet, malty, then bitter coffee alcohol burn .  This is a big, thick, chewy beer, and it hides the 18% astonishingly well, actually able to fold the  woody  alcohol flavor back into the rest of the attack on your taste buds: coffee, chocolate, honey, and all the sweet malt duking it out on the sweet/bitter battlewargrounds, making a mess all over your tastebuds","  rDev Drank 12/2020 out of a tulip, bottle dated 2013.   Psyched to finally drink this bad boy, been sitting on it for a while. Found it to pour a little thin and found the mouthfeel to be a little thin as well, especially compared to some of today's thicker pastry stouts. But the good news was the beautifully but not over the top boozy smell, and the same for the taste. Tradition mix of roast and and dark malts, but again, not over the top in any direction, with a nice boozy taste to it. Really enjoyed it.","  rDev Bottled in 2008 and purchased off of a shelf (in a store near Three Floyds, I think). Stored in various cellars and hutches since then.  The pour is, of course, pretty limp. But it's still got a surprising amount of fizz considering its age and intensely elevated ABV. It's a very dark red with a demonic ring of fizz in the middle that, I swear to god, looks like the ring from the movie The Ring.  The aroma is intense. I can smell thick, sour barley from two feet away. Taking a proper snort, the aroma becomes surprisingly thick, like Hershey's syrup and booze.  Age has treated this wonderfully. It's still weird, but not especially rough. The flavor nodes proceed as clear stages without any cohesion, like different parts of a cream-based salad that have curdled and separated throughout the years. Bitter barley moves into milk chocolate, which moves into soy sauce, which finishes on brown sugar and whiskey burn.   Overall... I dunno. I recall paying a price for this that seemed ridiculous in 2008 but was probably about what I pay for a 16 ounce can of mediocre IPA in 2020. It's definitely worth trying, but when compared to other super extreme classics like Utopias, it doesn't have the same sense of artistry. Nonetheless, producing a drinkable beer at 18% is an impressive feat.","  rDev DATE: August 7, 2020... OCCASION: enjoying my forty-fourth birthday eve with an amazing combination of this DFH WWS (this, the 16% ABV version) and Rush's Beyond the Lighted Stage.... GLASSWARE: Lindemans pokal snifter... pours a deep black body from a three-day, well-sealed grunt... a slight ring of browning bubbles surrounds a small upsurge of life in its middle... thick licorice, raisin, pinot noir, cocoa, soft coffee hints, and an intense, almost seering vapor of roasted malts... my goodness, a foreboding promise embedded here... its body is slightly oily at the entry, before it curls into a heavyweight drop of comforting warmth akin to whiskey... and yet, a bit of dryness... first in the profile is the licorice, which gives it a dessert-like quality... its secondary flavors include cocoa, coffee bean, and biting, aggressive malts that blanket the throat... a powerful, wine-like finish, boozy and full, with a malty blanket of raisin and whiskey... a tremendously strong hit of malts, with the grape and dark wine strength ...and yes, what took me so long to try this? maybe the price, which I have seen vary but mostly stretch the wallet... at $15.99 for a grunt, this wins and reminds me what awesome products DFH can craft...","  rDev 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Bottled 11/1/16, had 2/3/19.  Pours dark and opaque, a little garnet on the edges, with a half inch quickly dissipating foamy head and a little spotty cling. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, cocoa, figs, molasses, caramel, raisins, some smoke, a light hop aroma. Flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, raisins, molasses, smoke, caramel, less figs than the aroma, a pleasant hop bitterness throughout. Very light alcohol bleeds through. Really smooth for the ABV, a great full body, well carbonated.   An incredibly well executed beer. Has terrific, expressive aromas and great flavors. Drinks like it’s 9%, not 18%. Definitely one beer you should experience.","  rDev Bottle dated 4/23/19 into pint glass. Pours a dark brown with essentially no head. Initial impression is molasses, licorice, vanilla, and somewhat bitter herbal hops, overlaid with a very healthy dose of booze. Mouthfeel is slick and oily; carbonation is sufficient to lend a little prickle but really doesn't enhance the taste much. Finish is boozy and aa little bitter, with lots of molasses.  All things considered, I don't think this is worth the toll it's gonna take on me tomorrow morning. I can find better AIS's at lower ABV.","  rDev Appearance: Billowy, off-white tan head crowns an utterly opaque amber body, and retains very well. Scattered, patchy lacing adorns the glass walls.  Aroma: For an ale with an ABV of 16.25%, the alcohol must be a prominent component of the aroma; it presents spicy , vinous, and sweet, lacking any harshness. Nonetheless, there is also molasses, brown sugar, dark fruit, licorice, vanilla, and a little roast coffee.  Taste: As in the aroma, the spicy, sweet, and vinous alcohol is front-and-center. There is also brown sugar, molasses, licorice, and dark fruit. There is also quite a bit of wood and vanilla. Finishes, as expected, with prominent alcohol, molasses, and bitter herbal hops, though these are balanced quite gracefully.  Mouthfeel: Thich and syrupy, with only a bare hint of carbonation.  Drinkabilit/notes: To say that World Wide Stout is over-the-top is an understatement. But, you already knew that. Extremity can lead to greatness, and surely, this is such an instance. World Wide Stout is certainly shareable, my wife and I split a bottle and found that a half-bottle each was quite satisfying.  Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium balloon glass.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a small off white head. Smells of dark roasted grain with nice fruit profile. Tastes of fruity dark roasted grain, slight coffee. Beer is full bodied and a sipper, yet has good carbonation and is dangerously easy drinking. Overall, a very good beer.","  rDev Bottled 4/11/19. Poured at 56 degrees, black with ruby edges, and a fast fizzy tan head that dissipates quickly leaving a thin ring and even thinner island of micro dots on the surface; thin legs at best on swirl.

Smokey roast nuts, char, burnt brown toast up front; licorice, chocolate, toffee, oak, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, molasses, roast coffee bitter finish. Medium plus full body; medium minus carbonation; face flushing warmth from 16% abv; smooth tongue coating. Overall a tour de force of flavors - multiple layers of roast, malt and barrel notes with fruity dark cherry and sugary raisins in the finish.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Stamped bottling date is smudged, but I think it is November of 2017. Black colored body, with a red mahogany back lit edge. Not much head upon pouring but a nearly complete light brown cap sticks around. No lacing. Aroma wafts from the glass, and is quite intense when the nose is close. Smells of dark roasted barley, dried dark cherry, prune, and raisin. Presents a whiff of leather and tobacco, with a little cacao mixed in. The booze is what drives all of this into the nostrils. Taste is layered with dark, smoky, roasted malts, and the slight sweetness of dried dark fruit. Has alcohol expression similar to port. Kind of dry, with some chocolate at the end. Mouthfeel is a little thin. There is certainly the numbing sensation from the high ABV%. Supportive carbonation. Leaves an oily sheen on the glass, that slides back down into the body. The beer has a very long presentation, with different aspects expressing all throughout the main swallow and into the long after taste. There is a lot of breadth and depth to this sipping beer.","  rDev Bottled Nov 2009  A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a half finger of dense and rocky tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing. S: Smells of alcohol, roasted malts, dark fruits, and a hint of chocolate. T: Taste is roasted malts, a little oxidation, dark chocolate, coffee, some dark fruits. Oxidation is there, but it isn't excessive. Overall this one has held up well. On the swallow there's more roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, and slight charred wood. This beer has a very long finish. M: This beer is on the heavier side of medium in body with a slightly syrupy feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low end of effervescent while the beer has a drying finish due to the ABV. O: Overall this beer is an experience. It has a lot of flavor and complexity. There's a lot going on and it all seems to be pretty well balanced. It's also held up really well as there are barely any signs of oxidation on the beer. Well worth a try and well worth aging.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 2014 into the test glass. A - Deep and dark, no light penetrates the shell, carbonation provides a thin ring clinging to the glass. S - Dark fruit, molasses, raisin, fig reduction. on dark toast T - Follows the nose well add, some anise and a hint of mole. M - Sweet dark start, leads into cola reduction on the palate. finish is full and dark fruit based. O - An amazing experience, rich and full of tactile elements. Nose is quite something as well","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Bottled on 8/9/19, so very young.  Pours nearly jet-black. Hints of reddish-brown. A two-fingered foamy cola dark-tan head quickly subsides, but leaves a nice creamy ring of lacing.   Regardless of whatever else I say about this beer below, let no man say I did not extol its olfactory virtues. It smells excellent on initial presentation; and as it warms, it just gets better and better, nearly approaching dark boozy brew nirvana. The brew has strong aromas including molasses, dark/dried fruit (raisin, date, prune, plum, dried cherry), brown bread, dark chocolate, brandy, tobacco, leather, anise, char, toasted grain, and definitely booze. As it warms, the herbal qualities of the brew open up more and more. This brew smells absolutely fantastic.  The flavor definitely follows the nose until it runs headlong into a boozy roadblock. Toasted malts aggressively forward on the tip of the tongue. The brew quickly rounds out with a panoply of flavors. Raisin, date, chocolate, anise, coffee, brandy, rum, port wine, ash/char, toasted grain. And then--the finish is a combination of booze and some unexpected citrusy/hoppy notes, which may just be the booze showing up in multiple ways. The ABV is difficult to describe. On the one hand, ye gods, this is one boozy devil. On the other, for 18%, it's remarkably restrained, I suppose. I imagine some aging would do this bad boy some good. It seems to round out as the brew warms, and yet, hmmm.  The brew feels far lighter than I expected. Just shy of outright full-bodied, it nevertheless is malty as hell. The carbonation, though, is remarkably present at the finish. The booze just keeps this from being a knock out of the park. It's almost numbing on the throat, like a lozenge.   This brew, at least in this young stage, is the beer equivalent of a  million dollar move with a ten-cent finish  in basketball parlance. It looks great. It smells spectacular. But the booze is just strong enough to be a distraction from what otherwise seem to be excellent complex flavors. I consciously tried to rate this with the admittedly-high ABV in mind. But I still determined that it simply didn't measure up to some other high-ABV brews I've rated. As a case in point, Raison D'Extra by this same brewer has a similar (although admittedly slightly lower) ABV, but hides its booze much better, and lets the complex flavors shine through. That said, I acknowledge that I tried this bad boy when it was less than two months in the bottle. Consequently, I bought an extra bottle to stash for a year or two to see if it rounds into shape. For now, however, it lies dangerously close to  boozy novelty  territory for me.","  rDev 12oz bottle, dated 04/23/19, poured into a short tulip glass boasts a midnight black body with a cola colored edge when backlit. A 1/8  cream colored cap of tiny bubbles quickly falls to a thin edge-hugging ring and leaves a clean glass behind.  Aroma is subtle but roasty, vinous, and boozy.  Flavors match and bring complexity. The roastiness is neither chocolate nor coffee, but rather, barley. The vinousocity ©, is neither grape nor wine, but rather, stone fruit.   Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and quite full while clearing the palate cleanly.  Overall a great example of the style.","  rDev Dark as night and poured into a snifter without any head. I smell alcohol right up front with molasses, licorice, caramel and some dark fruit. WOW! the alcohol is strong but the taste is rich. I get the figs, prunes and date flavors. Molasses and maybe a hint of the licorice. I like that it lacks very much sweetness but is in no way bitter. I like the alcohol burn in the mouthfeel but it's otherwise creamy smooth and it's a sipper, really. Overall this is fabulous and I hope they keep it at the Total Wine. Bottled 4/11/2019. About $10 a bottle.","  rDev 12oz bottle served in a snifter glass. Bottled on 04/11/19 2028. ABV on the bottle says 16%, not 18%.   Appearance: Pitch black letting no light through. Initial tan head died back to a thick ring. Some occasional strands and islands of lacing that slide back down the glass or dissipated, as expected with a high ABV stout.   Smell: Molasses, roasted malts, alcohol, dark fruits/raisins and a tiny hint of something metallic.   Taste: Lots going on here - dark fruit/raisins, roasted malt bitterness, some caramel/toffee, molasses, bitter coffee, definite alcohol note.   Mouthfeel: Nicely thick and creamy, good carbonation, quite warming from the alcohol, semi-dry finish with some stickiness on the teeth.   Overall / Drinkability: A great full-flavored stout, not dominated by chocolate and coffee flavors, but with lots of other flavors that work with a beer this strong. A bit hot since it's a fresh bottling - I should pick up another bottle of this and let it sit a year to see how it changes. I should try this again in the winter - a great warming beer, but maybe a bit much for a summer evening.

Of course, I know the brewery produces outstanding beers. And this beer was one of those that encouraged aging ( ages well ). I drank this one a couple months after it was bottled. But man oh man was it a treat...pours a deep, dark, rich, opaque black color with loads of tan fluffy head and abundant smaller rings of lingering lacing that lasted for a long time. Smells amazing, deep rich mocha fudge, medium roast coffee, vanilla, caramel and some more faint roasted nuttiness. Taste follows the nose, and everything is so well-balanced, rich, deep, complex, flavorful. Smooth, chewy, rich, full mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. The ABV wasn't printed anywhere on the label and when I later found out it was 18% that just blew me away. This beer's high ABV is about as dangerously well-hidden as it gets!

Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol  heat  is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.  Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel.   This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!","  rDev Boy this one’s good. Whew. Powerful and strong yet flavorful and clean. So-called “triple” IPA obtained fresh from Founders via growler. Purchased on 9/6/19. Start off only decent, pours a honeyed medium amber color with a little white head that quickly settled to a thin film. Also just a little scarce spotty lingering lacing. Even with a rocky pour, the fluffy white head had settled quickly. The aromas, however, were just incredible. Beautiful fruity hops of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, guava and lemon. Also some nice malt, floral and herbal hops, bread, caramel and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, very rich and flavorful with good balance. The strong hit of hoppy bitterness was well offset by the sweeter malt backbone that had a good presence. Mouthfeel was excellent, sticky, slightly luscious, smooth and coated the palate. Good amount of carbonation. This was definitely a sipper, the higher ABV was quite present even with the beer cold, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’m happy that Founders brought this one out of retirement to serve it on tap at their brewery.","  rDev Bottled 5/24/15; drank 6/28/15 @ the Yarchives.   Semi-opaque ruby red appearance.   A rough pour produced a nice tan head; nice lace.   Grapefruit, mango, booze heat &amp; faint caramel notes in the nose.   Thick, sticky mouthfeel.   Caramel, raspberry &amp; strawberry flavors up front; a brutally bitter, dry alcohol heat finish.   Good flavors lurk beneath a punishing finish. Too bad.","  rDev Poured on tap. Pretty clear amber copper color with a modest light tan head. Plenty of grapefruit and orange on the nose, balanced with toasty malt. The taste was similar- bitter orange and citrus with some earthy notes. Not as malty as I expected given the huge ABV. Clean dry finish with a ringing bitterness.","  rDev I got this down at friar tucks in Savoy IL with my good friend and neighbor. The scent had hints of bitter citrus and molasses. The taste was bitter leaning with rich caramel malt fight. The mouthfeel is fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it's ok.","  rDev Pours a hazy deep amber/brown producing 2+ fingers of moderately lasting, creamy but variously bubbled, chunky, moderately lasting, beige head that leaves nice sticky webs of lace. Aroma is thick caramel, brown sugar, light vanilla, floral, pine resin &amp; citrus hops swimming in alcohol booze. Taste is burnt caramel malt sweetness well balanced with cedar, pine &amp; citrus hops up front with hops dominating by mid-sip, becoming full throttle by the finish &amp; delightfully bitter in the aftertaste. Starts predominantly sweet before turning hoppy, finishing dry, extremely hoppy &amp; bitter. Alcohol prominent throughout &amp; expressed as warmth, bitterness &amp; spice. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-medium carbonation, oily &amp; syrupy, mouth coating, gritty on the tongue &amp; slightly astringent in the aftertaste.","  rDev Not something for everyday, but good for something different.

Pours fairly hazy ruby red/light orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, lemon/orange peel, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light toffee, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/pine hops and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light toffee, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, creamy/bready, and lightly slick balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent huge DIPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the huge ABV, and despite aggressive bitterness. A very enjoyable offering.","  rDev On tap in Greenville SC. Pour is hazy brown-copper. The large, foamy off-white head is durable and leaves foamy lacing. Aroma: boozy, hoppy and sweet, with a promise of toffee. Flavor: moderately-high bitterness, but less than expected, and more sweet malts. some complexity. A bit boozy  Overall: a malty triple IPA.","  rDev A really nice beer, but overall killed by the candy sweetness. This could have been great. Caramel and toffee sweetness in the aroma, sweet malts in the flavor, a sugary malt bomb. No sign of the ABV though, although I suspect it will sneak up on me later.","  rDev Had on-tap at Alley Katz in Citrus Heights, CA  Appearance - Served up in a snifter with a finger's worth of sandstone colored head. The brew itself is relatively clear and beautifully deep ruby red. Good retention before dissipating to a thin, broken layer of surface suds. Good lacing, with chunks and large spots making up the bulk of it.  Smell - Interesting aroma, with notes of orange, grapefruit, sweetened raisins, toffee and a bit of spice.  Taste - A bit of a mess on the tongue. Near overwhelming amount of pine and citrus bitterness, while malts come through with a raisin bread-like sweetness. Cinnamon spice. Aftertaste lingers with more pine, grapefruit pith and a whole lot of boozy astringency.   Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Sticky texture; near syrupy. Dry, boozy finish.  Overall - One thing's for certain: this will definitely challenge the taste buds. Even for a well-versed hoppy beer drinker such as myself, I find this a bit rough and abrasive. It's certainly not undrinkable, and it does have its positive qualities, but I won't ever be dropping $20+ on a 4 pack for it.","  rDev Gotta love the outliers. This is on the edge. 112 btu, 12% Abv, dark bomb.  A: Looks great. 4 on color. Tawny, hazed, alcohol mirrored body, over set by scant lace and after a thick head, just a ring. Best color. S: Given what's to come, too light. malty, candied fruit, pine resin, sweet, approaching barley wine. T: Ample, complex, extremely bitter. Peppery, spicey, pungent yet still clean. Complex, strong herbal and earthy hops. Sweetness is balanced by the bitterness with candied fruit and tart citrus custard. Grand Mariner like. F: Thick, brandy body with low carbonation. Sharp &amp; crisp for the degree of sugar.  Overall:Warms up quickly and burns. The alcohol is prominent as are the pungent, bitter hops. As A bros wrote:  This beer is insane. No, absolutely insane! dropped bombs on our palates, ﬁght ﬁre with ﬁre! Aim and launch it at some really spicy ","  rDev Clear amber color with off-white head. Aroma has caramel, dark oranges and earth hops. Taste starts with big punch of hops, bitter and abrasive. Earthy, resiny and grassy. Intense, bitter finish and aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation. Overall it's a well made beer but triple IPA is not one of my favorite styles.","  rDev Pours very hazy dark amber, almost red, color with a 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. Very malty, citrus, caramel, piney aroma. Very appealing. Definitely a boozy taste. No hiding that. The strong malty taste almost drowns out any citrus but has a nice, aggressive piney hop at the end with a very smooth, creamy, caramel like ending. Strong astringency at the end.

Had never heard of it before purchasing it. Super pricey ($6.99 before the 10 percent deal) and it will be tough to live up to. But I love Founders (it’s currently at top-10 brewery (min. 10 reviews)) and I like boozy beer. Let’s do this.  Poured a copper, amber, hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of frothy, khaki head. Some hints of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Excellent spiderweb foamy lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)  Smelled a big whiff of tons of hops, not sure about 10 though. Could single out Mosaic and Citra out specifically, but that’s it. Also got tropical notes (stone fruit, mango and light pineapple), caramel, hints of spoiled orange peel and citrus zest. Initially smelled pretty good, but thinned out quickly. (Smell - 3.75)  All right, no hiding that 12 pct. Got a punch in the face of hops - Mosaic, Simcoe and Citra are most noticeable - to go along with tropical rind, mango, red grapefruit rind, juicy stone fruit, candied sugary caramel, resin backbone, herbal grassy hops and hints of vegetables. (Taste - 4.00)  Medium body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Finish starts out super boozy, but smooths out nicely. (Feel - 4.00)  This was better than I thought it would.

T: It's a full blown war between malt and hops. Pine and citrus, grapefruit, lemon, orange, gives way to fruity tropical notes, mango, passion fruit, peach, and a little plum, all fighting for supremacy against a mountain of toasty bready malt and caramel toffee sweetness, with a little booze (which is pretty expected in a 12% beast).  M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation keeps it from getting too syrupy, mild warmth.  O: This beer is an absolute monster. Sort of an imperial IPA meets barleywine. Fun one to try and a fine beer, but I can't say it'd be what I would reach for if I was craving a 3xIPA. I'm curious to see what a little age would do to this one.","  rDev Sticky and rich feel to this on first sip...boozy....first taste had some light tropical rum like notes....aroma more pine....pine emerges on the taste as well.....toffeeish malt...a somewhat sharp biting bitterness on the finish...more of an alcohol sharpness than hop finish...  Overall I find this too boozy and alcohol laden with all the hops really not shining through much. I've had many beers with more ABV and less biting alcohol notes.","  rDev Pours a hazy, opaque ruby-plum with a thick white khaki head. Head retention is moderate to strong with good lacing. Aroma is a blast of hops with notes ranging all over the spectrum. Dominate notes of the aroma are resin, floral, and earthy. The flavor profile actually has a considerable amount of toasted, biscuit malts, or perhaps all of the hops are cancelling each other out. Hop notes in the flavor include resin, pine, and spruce. Mouth feel is full with a smooth, velvety texture. Overall, it's a huge beer. Not only is the ABV at 12%, but the hop notes are incredibly abundant. Despite the complexity and hugeness of this beer, it does remain easy to drink or sip. Rather enjoyable. It does not seem to be  harsh  as the IPA stereotype suggests, although this is one I would recommend for  hop haters  to steer clear of, especially at this price (hops are expensive).  Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev 2016-06-11 12oz bottle bought in Hill City, SD, driven to Denver, and flown home to Seattle. Bottled on 05/02/16. Served in a tulip.  Pours a surprisingly dark clear amber with medium-small head and lots of very fine carbonation. Smell is tropical fruit, ripe pineapple, smells nice.  Taste is a fruity sweetness with a delicate floral note and a moderately bitter finish. Somewhat dangerous in its ability to hide 12% abv. A little roasty character seems to come through (or I might be fooled by the visible darkness). Subsequent sips enhance the bitterness to extremely high levels, but its somewhat vague. Keeps me coming back for the pineapple sweetness, though.  Mouthfeel is very thick, sticky, almost a barleywine. Overall, it's a worthy but not excellent beer.","  rDev Half growler from Whole Foods in Fairfax VA. Pours a deep amber with small-medium head that leaves a ring and spotty lacing. Nose more dried fruits come from the heavy malt than citrus and some earthy from the hops, but both are present. Flavor is deeply sweet and bitter together at once...sort of a barleywine meets IPA hop bomb. Candied fruit comes in strongly, but the high bitterness cuts through to prevent any cloying feeling. Full mouthfeel. Overall, a very good beer, but maybe too much of everything doesn't quite equal a well balanced beer.","  rDev From a bottle, this chestnut colored beer has a 2 finger head, off-white in color and providing good lace. The aroma is all about hops...musty, pungent, woody, spicy, hops. The taste has plenty of malt sweetness as a canvas, but the story is painted by the hops. Flavorful, pepper, fruit, pine, citrus peel, and pine. Lots of complexity here. Dangerous because it really hides it's ABV, but this is one incredible beer.","  rDev Huge thick orange pour, this is a sandwich in a bottle. For having so much dry hopping, this didn't come across as really all that. Hops yes, but fresh dry hop late stage aroma hops? Not as much, came through a lot more like a barleywine, with all the heavy booze and malt stuff.   Taste packs a ton of bitterness into a massive caramel presence. This is pretty much a barleywine for all intents and purposes. Its hot. You can't discern specific hop flavors because there are so many different ones in immense ways that it all just coalesces into a giant barleywine.   A neat beer, but hardly something I really wanna drink a bunch of in one sitting."]},{"Name":"Resin","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10607/77299/","Brewery":"Sixpoint Brewery","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":9.10,"Score":92.0,"Comments":["  rDev slim can, best by Nov 14, 2021 (oops), into THAT!

Orange colour, moderate head, slightly off-white. Surprisingly moderate aroma of American piney and grapefruity hops. In the flavour, however, both the piney / resinous and grapefruity notes are very distinct - still the beer is reasonably well balanced, the malts are sufficient, with a certain fruity sweetness, and where I expected an unbalanced resinous hell, there is actually as much smoothness as you can expect from a 103 IBU beer. Might well buy again.","  rDev Clear, bright golden coloring, big ivory head that settles down quickly.  Aroma is all kinds of citrus, big hop bitterness, all the things that the hophead yearns for, really. Lemon and lime and orange rind. Pine needles and flower pedals. Kinda nice.

Great dark caramel coloration with a strong reddish tinge, head is thin and not long lasting, but I can overlook that. The smell was full of malt, some hints of the hops, and a tad muted.

Candied grapefruit and orange peel, orange marmalade, caramel, toast, lemonade powder, pine sap, earthy dankness.  T: Big juicy orange and grapefruit upfront. Blood orange and ruby red grapefruit juice, as well as candied grapefruit peel. On the mid-palate there is a firm toasted bread malt backbone, slight caramel, slightly sweet but not too sweet. On the back end, in typical Sixpoint fashion, there are those subtle tropical fruit notes--candied blueberry with guava and lychee. The finish is piney, earthy, and resinous; moderately bitter of pine needle but not an overpowering medicinal bitterness. There are also faint green onion/garlic notes. Finishes well-balanced, with just touches of lingering sweetness and bitterness.  F: Medium-plus-bodied, well-rounded with a nice chewy breadiness. It's not creamy or milkshake-like, but it's a substantial filling sensation. Moderately carbonated, just enough to push across the palate fairly rapidly.

Nose is actually much lighter than expected with some dank pine and a few generic fruity tropical notes. Taste is bigger, and certainly features sticky resinous pine. Has a touch of sweetness, but not overly for for such a big beer. It also keeps some of those fruity tropical notes. Perceived Bitterness is certainly lower tha the 103 IBUs listed.

Poured into an Ommegang snifter.   Pours a surprisingly gold color (I expected burnt orange like a barleywine) with a fluffy creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a mossy ring with lace built up on the sides.   Aroma is pleasantly fruity and bright with elements of grape and citrus, slight pineapple, slight melon. Everything is brighter than expected. I guess I should shift my focus.   Flavor is a bit wasted at this point with some oxidized hops in tow somewhere; trying to re-align, I spot some more vinous but still white grape-ish notes, some oak barrel, a little bit of muscat, some melon rind, white grapefruit, honey, chive, and a bit of cilantro or other fresh herb.   Feel is crisp and starchy, but has a nice sticky yet oaky barrel barrel presence. Alcohol presence is rather high but to be expected, though feels more along the lines of a 12%'er. Drying finish with that microfiber sponge feel.   Overall this beer isn't bad, and I should try to find it fresher to get a better picture of it. Dogfish Head continues to be the curator of off-centered shit and this is definitely one of those examples. I like it though, it's twisted and won't fit into any of your neat little polite food tray-sized niches.   Price paid : $3.69 / bottle Would buy again : Probably, to try it fresher.","  rDev Bottled 1/22/20  Ancient ales, huh? My first one of the series, I didn't even realize they were doing a batch this year  Pours a lightly cloudy orange/gold with just a white cap that fizzles away to a ring of bubbles very fast and leaves no lacing  Quite the odd aroma here, I'm picking up a lot of different notes. There's an earthy, peppery spice carrying through, white grape, and raw honey all combine to make an odd but not bad scent  Oh yeah, that's a fuck ton of saffron in the taste, not really something you expect in a beer, even though this is brewed with it. The honey comes though strong in the beginning, sweet and unrefined, and only gets sweeter as the sip progresses. However, there are tart fruit notes to finish, mostly white grape, peach, and green apple. Oddly enough, the flavor reminds me of some strange nitro energy drink I had years ago that I think was supposed to be grape flavored and had some spice as well  Pretty light body and mild carbonation, this thing bounces back and forth between tart and sweet to keep things interesting. Finishes just off dry  A perplexing beer for sure. One could argue that this is a great example of a beer with non traditional ingredients and pulls it off due to lack of expectations. Others however, might say that this is hardly beer and is not good. Regardless of how weird this is, I like it quite a bit. DFH always keeps it weird","  rDev Bottled on 6/28/2019, revisiting this classic after who knows how many years.   Look: The beer is translucent with a slight haze. Straw - pale gold. Some visible carbonation. A bone white head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer, with some larger bubbles here and there. Some lacing at first that eventually goes away.  Smell: The nose on this pops with sweet and bready grains, and bright, vinous white grape that has white wine qualities. Apple and apple skin. Honeysuckle. As the beer warms the ABV becomes slightly noticeable, but not in a distracting way.   Taste: The taste is sweeter than the nose suggests, and the honey really comes out in the flavor. It’s bit heavier on the palate than the nose, as the white wine quality gets a bit lost with the sweetness. Quite bready and sweet with some yeast esters showing. The beer does dry out a bit.   Feel: Medium level of carbonation that offers some nice lively body to the sweet flavor. Starts sweet and dries out.   Overall: The nose on this beer is great. The flavor profile is a bit sweeter than the aroma suggests, and I’d love more of the grape profile in the flavor. That being said, this beer is very drinkable for 9%, and overall very enjoyable. Happy to have revisited.","  rDev Pours a copper-orange with bits of grit and particles suspended within the liquid as if they were frozen in time. Head is a finger and a half of off-white foam with modest retention. Aroma is honey, caramel, orange, tart green grapes, grassy, herbal and floral hops with a bit of biscuity, toasty malts behind. Very odd, but bright, aroma. Flavor profile is dense, layering notes of safron with tart, juicy grapes, orange rind, and honey. Malts form a light bready, earthy base, but the overall consistency is 'sweet'. Mouth feel is lightly pulpy with that suspended grain playing a role within the texture. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, thick and rindy with hearty notes of grapes and honey making for a sweet and off-center brew.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Bottle from Brewers Haven. Clear, medium golden body with a small cap of foamy head. Grainy aroma, malty, reminiscent of some of the emmer or spelt beets in Germany. Taste starts out malty before turning over to some savory, herbal flavors, woody, juniper. I guess the ancient Sumerians had it pretty good...","  rDev Bottled 06/28/19. A light orange color with an odd look due to the tiny specks of suspension. The light carbonation is a nice addition though. No head. The aroma is nice. It does smell sweet like wine. Taste follows the nose and I get some sweetness that would make me think of soda pop almost. The flavors on the tongue are like an orange drink. It tastes good but it doesn't seem beer like at all. The mouthfeel is very nice. I think you pour this into a cup and tell someone it's soda pop and they wouldn't know the difference. That 9% ABV would be a BIG surprise though. Overall an interesting experience that a beer nerd would appreciate from the truly great craft brewer Dogfish Head, Milton, Delaware.","  rDev On tap: Yet another style-bending brew, DFH’s website’s current description isn’t offering up much as to whether this should be more of a gruit or just a “miscellaneous” beer.  Have had this before, probably about a dozen times. It comes to me as a Belgian pale with a bit of spices and honey. It is likely far more sophisticated than the ancients’ version from which the recipe was engineered, which is fine with me.  Crystal clear golden leaning amber/orange with a lovely head that leaves striations against the glass. A very small sticky aspect to the otherwise light-medium body.  The “beer” cleans and dries well, but in between is a honey sweet, orchard fruit, spice-countering beverage. The beer has a bittering note that resembles spruce, but also a meadow flower aspect (that I want to associate with the yeast for unknown reasons).  A nicely done beer that I think could be entered in a broad-based saison contest and not be thrown out immediately (though it also wouldn’t win).","  rDev This is one I've been meaning to try for a while. The head dies quickly and the nose features a dry nose with grapeskin and funk.   There is an ale like body here but the flavors are mostly favoring grapes. An interesting concoction, but glad I only got a single.","  rDev ** 06/12/19  bottle to pilsner glass.   LOOK: beer, straw color, medium white head, ok retention. AROMA: hay, grass, grape, apple,  TASTE: hay,apple, grape, light barley/rice. FEEL: a bit flat, but smooth and drinkable.  Not excellent but interesting based on the idea.

Aroma is sweet and dry, honey, cereal, muscadine grape, clove and thin banana. Taste is sweet with honey, muscadine grape, other fruity hints, Belgian yeast character clove, a little alcohol and a metallic hint. Spicy finish, sweet aftertaste. Crisp flavors. I'm not enough of a grape man to recognize Muscat grapes but this Southern boy knows his muscadine grapes (a species native to the southeastern/south-central U.S. and it sure presents muscadine-like elements in both the nose and mouth. Alcohol while detectable is well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with low carbonation, smooth but a little syrupy and tongue clinging.","  rDev A sweet, creamy slow-sipper that is pretty wine-like. Honeyed pear and apple flavors with a bit more carbonation (thankfully) than expected. Unique and worth a try.","  rDev Dogfish Head Midas Touch Ancient Ale, 9% ABV. Pours cloudy yellow, with a one finger white head. Nose is malt, honey, and sweet grape. Taste is sweet grapes, almost no bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall excellent.","  rDev Pours a clear golden orange color with a thick foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma of white grapes and some honey. There is definitely a wine/mead mixture on the taste with some honey thrown in at the end. Lighter bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation.","  rDev Slightly hazy orange color with beige head. Aroma has sweet, syrupy malt, candied tangerines and resiny hops. Taste is bittersweet with dried fruits, candied apricot, bitter orange peel on the finish. Medium body with medium to light carbonation. Tasty, complex, well hidden ABV.","  rDev Midas Touch has a medium, white head, a yellow, hazy appearance, some bubbles, and not much glass lacing. Aroma is of odd, honey, sourdough, and spiced white bread. Taste is of those elements, with low or no bitterness. Rather heavy mouthfeel, here. Midas Touch finishes medium dry. Hard to get a handle on this one.   RJT","  rDev One must love honey to love this mead beer but it's pretty great. 4 for originality.  A) Pours a slightly hazed, honey orange body with a deep rich dense pillow head that laces but doesnt last (fruit in beer does that). s) Wine, honey, over ripe sub-baked grapes on vine, and saffron. t) Begins with honey, over ripe grapes and pears, but more late hang on the vine, over-ripe without being sweet, more fertile, wild, and pungent - then resolving into a bitter, peppery see saw and an off-dry finish. f) Wine like, clear finish, mid way between wine and saison.  o) Loved it. Must be in everyone's repetoire. Will pair well with pork, chicken, bbq and sushi.","  rDev Almost-clear, deep gold, with light white head.  Smells of white grape juice, something faintly spicy, and sweet malt, similar to cornbread+honey. A bit of brandy-ish booziness as it warms, which bumped up the smell score a bit.   Tastes : honey, coriander-like, but smoother/mellower (the saffron?) , white wine, and a slight tannic/woody flavor. Finishes with a light, drying bitterness.   Moderate, lightly oily, feel, with fine, lightly prickly carbonation on the finish.  As described on the label, it seems a (well-balanced) mix of mead &amp; white wine. + a golden ale. I like it, and will likely have it again.","  rDev This beer pours a rich deep fold with a smallish head. The aroma is sharp and astringent, with white grape, gooseberry, roses, violets, sweet bread, cinnamon, green apple, toast and toffee. The flavor is semi sweet, with notes of honey, sweet bread, banana, white grape, grapefruit flesh, and toffee. The motuhfeel is fairly full with moderate prickly carbonation. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer that hits that nice point between rich and sweet.","  rDev Along the upper neck of the bottle, in nearly illegibly printed text:  BOTTLED ON 05/09  There appears to have been more but it is rubbed off.  Appearance: The body is a bright golden color with some haze. The head is short and white with a mix of creamy and fizzy textured bubbles. Although it is hard to see through the glass it looks very good.  Aroma: It has a Cheerios aroma and it has a bit of that slightly grassy lager aroma.  Taste: There is a bit of a sweet honey and grain flavor to the beer up front. It has a slightly metallic flavor to the beer but it is mostly sweet.  Mouthfeel: it feels a bit syrupy and it has this slightly acidic character in the aftertaste. The body is about medium but because of the sweetness and the slightly syrupy texture it definitely makes the beer a sipper. The alcohol is expertly hidden. The beer also has a really great smoothness to it.  Overall: This beer is a bit of a mixed bag. While the label claims this to be crafted with  barley, honey, white muscat grapes, &amp; saffron  most of the flavor is lost. To the beers credit it did have a nice sweet honey and grain flavor but it tasted nothing like grapes or saffron. It is also a very smooth beer. I would probably drink it again if I was i the mood for a sweet honey-flavored beer. At the same time it can be so sweet that it makes you crave something savory. I would recommend it to those who are attracted by the notion of a sweet tasting beer that is not full of artificial flavors or fruits.  On a side-note I must say that I have had this beer in the past and at this time the beer is head and shoulders over what it was during previous iterations. Previously it had a more vinous quality and it was a bit more acidic. At the time of this review it is far more sweeter and it dwarfs the acidity aforementioned. It certainly takes a more  mead over wine  approach but even the acidity that is often found in mead is very well balanced in this beer. If you have had the beer in the past and found it unpalatable then I would recommend revisiting it.","  rDev Pours orange with a very thin white head that left no lacing. Smells of honey, herbs, wine and sweet malts. Taste follows the nose along with an additional sour note. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated, finishes dry.

This smells like very little - corn, sweet maltiness, nothing else.  This is a bit more inoffensive than the typical light lager, but there's just basically nothing to this. That's honestly probably the point, but it makes reviewing it kind of pointless.  This is very light bodied, almost water-like, with a vague off putting sweetness on the back end that's faint when very cold, but comes out stronger as the beer warms up a bit.  This isn't the absolute worst of this sort of beer, but it's still not really recommended at all.","  rDev I’ve had 1739 beers and I can’t believe I’ve never reviewed Miller Lite....sometimes they just slip through the cracks.

Sparkling soft gold with a thick white head and clinging collar leaving drippy lace all around the rim.  Smell has hints of white grape and raspberry within primarily white bread and sweet corn overtones.  The medium body and unobtrusive, medium soft yet crisp carbonation delivers flavors of semi-sweet corn, grape and white wheat with faint accents of strawberry salt water taffy, finishing semi-dry. Somehow it remains balanced despite those descriptors, and is not too sweet or bready like many other mass market lagers, executing its purpose of being supremely drinkable admirably.","  rDev Ok, I gave it a 3 overall because I had the beer during a hockey tournament in which I did well.

Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good.

Appearance- A dark yellow color with a small white head. Taste- Has a hoppy taste but not overpowering. You can taste the slight fruit flavor. Palate- A medium bodied beer with lots of carbonation. Has a small bitter aftertaste that many who don't care for IPAs will approve of. Overall- A really good solid Dogfish Head brew. I am not a super-hop head but I enjoyed this immensely.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours red orange with very little head. Smells of pine hops and sweet fruit, apricots of course. Tastes of fruit with slight earthy hops. Beer is nicely carbonated finishes nicely. Overall a very good beer.","  rDev A - Copper color with slight haze, small white head, extensive lacing.  S - Fairly muted, flat hop notes, malts in the form of pilsner coming through loud and clear.  T - Hop is mostly in the form of grass notes. A mild fruity note coupled with a cracker and grain malt hit. Turns bitter on the close, illustrating the serious hopping.  M - Given how bitter the turn is on the close, it is surprising how crisp the feel is. There is a gradual build, though, and it does burden the beer a bit you move into the second 6 oz.  O - This hybrid beer promises fruit, but though I think it is a decent IPA - nothing special, mind, but fairly clean and thoroughly hopped - the fruit is mostly lost. The only hint to its presence is a certain sweetness in the middle. Supporting role, indeed.","  rDev 12 oz, sediment-free bottle.   Clear reddish-amber with a good beige head and very good lacing   Feel: medium body; smooth; Medium+ carbonation.   Smell: soft fruits not specifically apricot with a clear spicy hop presence.   Taste: lightly spicy, APA hop level; solid malt backbone; fruity with subtle apricot   O: interesting and worthwhile IPA variant.","  rDev A: Looks like tea. Copper with a light orange colour, mostly clear and filtered looking, medium carbonation, 3 fingers of beige head.  S: Apricot, Campbell’s tomato soup, totally, with some milk added. Alpha-getti, the whole canned tomato quality comes through. Light fruity orange, light evergreen quality.  T: Black tea, tomato soup, dry tannic quality, good solid bitterness on the end.  M: Thick body, medium low carbonation, very dry finish, like moisture is being sucked from the tongue.  O: A very interesting brew, making me think of canned soup, apricots and black tea."]},{"Name":"Julius","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28743/86237/","Brewery":"Tree House Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - New England","Alcohol":6.80,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev Hazy body, orange and peach toned; huge head, rocky and white; sticky globs of foam cling to the glass.

A turbid swirl of hazy golden orange pushes a most bountiful dense, white, fluffy head to the rim. The retention is solid, and the lacing is layered and clumpy. Nose is bursting with citrus and slightly acidic tropical notes. Orange, grapefruit, and tangerine lead the way. Overripe mango, pineapple, and some pepper-like notes. Taste goes in a little different direction. Definitely orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, and mango. Puling some melon, pineapple, and peppery grass notes too. But it's going in a harsher direction than initially hinted at. More bold than balanced. There is still a lot going on that I like, but she's a bit more than assertive. Mouthfeel is fluffy, active, with a bitter finish. Overall, a very tasty, boldly hopped NEIPA. Maybe this can/batch was a bit stronger than usual. I'd love to give this another shot in the future.","  rDev Deep hazy orange gold color with white cap and lacing.  Aroma is ripe citrus forward with a sharp herbal background. The scent is rich, heady and earthy like the grounds of an orchard with ripe fruit strewn about.  In taste the citrus is more tropical without losing it's sense of depth. I also get something more melon like in the flavor like ripe honeydew that lends fullness and balance to the rich citrus/hop mixture.  Full, soft, velvety texture with balancing carbonation.  A remarkable beer with an impressively balanced range of flavors.","  rDev Pours a bright orange color, about the same color as the can with a medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of oranges mainly. Tastes similar with big orange flavors, some tart grapefruit, and a hint of melon. Tart and juicy finish. Velvety medium bodied mouthfeel, perfect amount of carbonation finishing pretty clean. Overall an excellent beer, possibly one of my favorites from Treehouse.","  rDev Pours a beautiful orange juicy color with a fabulous big head. Aroma is different but really inviting. Not really juicy but hoppy is my best guess. I think I smell some malt in those hops. It tastes different for this style as it lacks any sweetness. I get citrus, grapefruit, passionfruit and maybe peach texture as it's mouthfeel is creamy smooth and lacks any bitterness so this is on helluva blend. I can see how tasters rate this very highly.

Solid.","  rDev Canned on 8/18/20; consumed 9/8/20  Pours an opaque dark orange with soft bronze hues and topped with multiple fingers of dense, creamy white head; excellent head retention fades slowly to a slim, craggy cap, expansive, frothy collar, and a multitude of chunky, soapy rings of lacing rounding the glass.  Aroma bursts with a steady array of juicy tangerine and passionfruit backed with grassy tones and flaky malts as layers of orange complexity develop throughout the bouquet; subtle lemon flows effortlessly beneath a perfectly nuanced tropical profile as ripe guava, mango pith, peach chutney, and fresh grapefruit all develop in harmony over time.  Taste opens with silky peach and more pronounced guava, with wisps of creamy orange lurking beneath; passionfruit and grapefruit peel develop a citric twang to the profile over the mid-palate while herbal lemon zest and a fluffy malt base fades with the finish/swallow.  Mouthfeel offers a medium body synchronized with a delicate and fluffy moderate carbonation, plush along the palate with an impressive consistency and steadily building grit; juicy textures present subtly past the mid-palate, peaking with a fading hop acidity into a dry finish with a mild, zesty bitterness lingering.  A stunningly nuanced approach to the NEIPA, almost deceptively balanced between an exceptionally refined flavor and unfaltering overall structure; a product of significant focus, depth, and ultimately, a level of simplicity which ties it all together as the world-class beer it is; there may be others with more a bombastic profile, but this remains unwavering and unassuming in its brilliance.","  rDev Poured from a 16oz can into a pub glass.   Look is a very hazy pale yellow with a thick white head.   Aroma is bright orange tangerine.   Taste is pithy bitter tangerine. Very bright.","  rDev 16 oz can. Pours a hazy orange with white head. A ton of lacing. Taste is semi sweet with juicy tropical fruits and citrus. Medium to low bitter finish. Overall very good, extremely juicy, Just spectacular.","  rDev Canned 7/10/20 “Buzz is back!” stamped on the bottom  Here we go! I made a trip up to Tree House for the first time yesterday to pick up a mixed case that had 8 different beers. I did have this one and a few of the others last night, but now it’s time to sit down with it and give it a thorough review  Pours a murky, hazy orange gold with a massive 3 finger tall white head that has great retention and leaves nice lacing  A huge explosion of juice in the nose, this is loaded with notes of candied peach, orange, pineapple, and grapefruit. Resiny hops and pale malt balance out the fruit, veering this closer to a standard IPA, at least in the nose  To start things off in the taste, there is tons of orange and mango, not carrying any of their associated tartness. The fruit brightens on the swallow, and is balanced out by incredibly smooth bready malt and oily hops  A very soft feel right in line with the style. Medium bodied with almost no carbonation, this still surprisingly finishes quite dry and just a touch sweet  Damn, this is the first Tree House brew I’ve had the honor to try. It was worth the hour drive for a mixed case. Hats off to these guys, they make me proud to be from Mass","  rDev Poured from 12oz tall can into a tulip. Canned on 6/26/20.  Appearance: ludicrously murky medium-orange hue with a finger of frothy ivory foam atop. Looks great!  Smell: very juicy aroma with lots of orange and mango. It's nicely smooth, with a bit of complexity; it's very enticing indeed.  Taste: oh, that is quite lovely. To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed with the aroma (which was still very good, but considering this beer's tremendous hype, underwhelming nonetheless); however, the flavor is just wonderful. Richly tropical and orangey; subtly complex. There is a whole lot going on here and it all plays together so well. This might be, to date, the best IPA I have had. Just an absolute treat.  Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a huge carbonation and a really super creamy, satisfying mouthfeel, way beyond what this style normally accomplishes. Wonderful.  Overall: I cracked this beer poured, had a look, took a whiff, and thought,  what's all the hype about?  Then I had a sip. The sip sold me on it forever. Just an amazing beer.","  rDev Sweet orange/tangerine citrus, and bready/biscuity nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy and hoppy, orange citrus bitter bite. This is really well-balanced throughout the swallow...it drinks like a double! Soft and juicy mouthfeel on this bad boy! Fantastic!","  rDev Canned on 6/11/2020. Poured into a Spiegalau IPA glass. It pours a turbid, golden-tangerine color with a very large, creamy, bright white head and thick, soapy lacing. The aromatic smell feature sweet tangerine, tart lemon, mango, and a whiff of melon. The initial taste is bright, sweet orange, peach, mango, and hint of vanilla. But at mid-palate the tart lemon and citrus comes alive along with hops that provide a nice, balanced bitterness. The flavors are amazing. The mouth feel is plush and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and at 6.8% ABV it's extraordinarily drinkable. Overall, Julius is the quintessential New England IPA. It lives up to its legendary reputation.","  rDev This baby was fresh - less than a month old.  Pours a completely opaque dirty straw color with less than a finger of head. The nose is citrusy. The flavor profile has grapefruit and lemon flavors but, honestly, it is too light and delicate for my liking. The finish is nicely pithy, resiny and dry but the bitterness is on the low end.  March 2021 update: Gave this offering a second try. This time I gave it the Heady Topper treatment - drank it from the can.  Consumption from the can yields a stronger bitterness on the finish. Also, it seems less thin. As always, it's tough to tell if the difference is real or if it is the power of suggestion.","  rDev My first Julius, taken to go from the brewery. Expectations sky high given the reputation and the two wonderful pints, Very Green and Gggreeennn, I had on the premises.  From the can it pours a hazy orange color with a moderate frothy head. It dissipates after a couple of minutes and yields a sticky ring of lacing.   The nose emits a burst of juicy tropical and citrusy hops aromas, tantalizing and pungent. There are notes of orange, tangerine, lime, pineapple, mango, passion fruit and a hint of peach. A touch of bread and dry cracker comprise the subtle malt aromas. Towards the end, the herbal hops become increasingly dank and spicy, as they impart leafy green, grassy and piney aromas.   Juicy for sure but with a nice dry palate that makes for easy drinking. Delicious flavors of candied oranges, mango, pineapple, grapefruit pith, peach and passion fruit. Great interplay between the soft tropical and zesty citrus flavors. Medium to full bodied with a mouthfeel that opens soft and with a creamy malt backbone. However, as the hops begin to dominate the malts, the mouthfeel becomes increasingly spicy and prickly. Notes of pine and grass add a resiny and dank flavor, while the finish, long and dry, becomes increasingly resiny and bitter. There is a modest presence of clean alcohol spice. The carbonation is moderate and just right.  Wonderful beer! My only regret is that I purchased only 4 cans. Definitely lives up to the hype.","  rDev Thanks to yllib for fresh can.  Appears as orange Julius with white foamy head.  Smells of oranges and tropical fruit. (If heady topper is all grapefruit this is all orange) Taste is an orange and slightly piney bittery balance.  Little thinner body than it would appear.  Nice and refreshing. Unthreatening and unmemorable for me however. For some reason I expected more complexity. Maybe better if it wasn’t freezing weather. * Update: 2nd can from yllib in June. Improved batch and score slightly, still not blown away as much as some other Treehouse ipa’s.","  rDev Given to me by my friend Joe B. Poured into a large stemmed tulip. Canned on Nov 6, 2019.  Maybe not the freshest can, regardless the reality did not live up to the hype. A great new England IPA. One that does not go overboard with the smoothness, but also not the juice bomb I was expecting. 4.5  A - Pours a murky slightly dark orange. Like orange juice with a two-finger white rocky head. 4.25  S - Aromas of citrus, orange, pineapple, slightly sweet. 4.5  T - Herbal and citrus rind with lighter grapefruit and peppery flavors in the background. A tinge of fruity sweetness, except in the finish. 4.25  MF - Medium light bodied with smooth start and middle ending with a dry almost biting finish. 4.5","  rDev Hazy to cloudy orange with two fingers of antique white head. Great retention slowly gives way to sudsy rings of lacing.  Orange and peach in the nose.  Similar citrus and peach up front in the taste, coupled with a firm malt backbone and moderately strong bitterness in the finish, especially for the substyle — a mix of citrus pith and more traditional pine. Makes for a very drinkable IPA.   Full mouthfeel, lightly creamy, with strong carbonation.  This a flagship for a reason, and great example of how a NEIPA should be brewed. Great, balanced bitterness make it one I’d gladly session (despite the ABV).","  rDev Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Hazed juicy pour with 2 fingers of foamy white head.

One finger white head stays around with lots of individual bubbles. Leaves behind some partial sheets of lacing. Faint aroma of fruity malts and baking spices (cloves). Presents a whiff of slightly sour yeast. Taste has several stages of progression. First is slightly sweet fruit with spice (raisin and banana), then some malty bread sweetness, and then the slightly sour yeast at the end. The after taste is a blend, with the fruit and spice coming back. Medium mouth feel, with slight syrup. Good carbonation. Dry at the end.

There is a touch of sour, but only a tinge, especially towards the end of the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium-thick in terms of consistency with a fuzzy, velvety texture.

I found this to have a visually appealing orange-copperish color, weak to no head and no lacing to mention. The smell was a bit also-ran - wheaty, earthy, with hints of fresh grass to it. Sloshing this around your mouth proved to be very crisp and light, very drinkable at 7% ABV.

Phenolic, brett flavor with light hints of delicate sweetness; mild fruit notes like pear. Heavy body yet rather flat; starts slightly sweet but finishes dry overall.

S: Belgian yeasts and malts, fruity, a blue cheese bite, smooth and light, dry all the way through to the finish.  T: Follows the nose. Well balanced. Reminds me of Leffe Blonde, and is in my opinion much closer to true Belgian style than many other highly rated American versions of Belgian beers.

Price: $8.00 Purchased: Dec. 14, 2016 Consumed: Dec. 14, 2016 Reviewed as: Belgian Strong Pale Ale Misc.: N/A  Was staying at the Hard Rock for a work trip and had planned on heading to the Goose Island Pub once I saw that BCBS was on tap. The plan was to review Sofie and Matilda, and have a BCBS. However, once I got there I was told that they ran out of BCBS in the last hour. Bummer. Still wanted to try both beers and was actually surprised that I had not yet.  Poured a copper amber clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy white head when I got it. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Decent wet foamy lacing. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.75)  Smelled banana, pear, mandarin, range, allspice, cinnamon, sugary Belgian cloves and Circus Peanut candy. (Smell - 4.00)  Tasted allspice, Belgian cloves, peppery spices, banana, pear, spicy coriander, Belgian candy, grassy notes, hints or herbal and caramel. (Taste - 3.75)  Medium body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Lively carbonation. Dry finish. (Feel - 3.75)  Not as good a beer as Sofie, but glad I got to try it. (Overall - 3.75)  3.81 | 86 | B+","  rDev Poured from a single serve bottle  Pours a pleasantly hazy, but not cloudy orange/amber. Very little head, but persistent pleasant lacing.   Smell--Evocative of the true Belgians of the style, but somewhat muted. Still, it has a nice pleasant  funk  from the Brett that comes through. The hop and citrus notes are balanced by a honey sweetness.  Taste--American takes on this style can be disappointing in the complexity department. This has a nice range of notes to touch all areas of the palate. Funky Brett, banana, pineapple, honey sweet candi sugar and malt, with just a touch of alcohol burn. A nicely balanced set of tastes.  Feel--Solid, medium body. Not spectacular, but still spot on.  I am a shameless Orval apologist, and tend to hold anything of this style to that unreasonably high standard. This is an excellent stateside take.","  rDev ** 08/10/2015 2013 bottle to pilsner glass. Light caramel color. Globules of sediment float. Big creamy eggshell head. Head lasts throughout beer. Aroma is equal hops and yeast. Taste is creamy hops. Light and summery. Yeast is very subtle, maybe it would be stronger if left to ferment in bottle a few more years. Very nice.  ** 08/04/2018  3+ year old bottle to wine glass. (Bottled 01/23/15) Holds up excellently.   **","  rDev Artwork: A very simple and classy white label with the beer's name on it. Love it.   Appearance: Dark amber. Big head with reasonable retention and lovely lacing. Unintentionally I poured the yeast in which introduced some haziness.  Nose: Very spicy on the nose. Smells sweet.   Taste: Lots of spice, Belgian yeast, and some dark fruits. Rather sweet. Very nice and rich.   Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation bite. Medium body.   Overall: This is a great beer. I'm not sure how much I could drink in one sitting (because of its richness) but then again this was not designed to be a session beer. Would definitely buy again if given the chance.","  rDev Poured a copper red color with a 1F head in an Orval Trappist glass.  The aroma is quite good, but not strong: spice and fruit,  The taste gets more pronounced with warming: strong spicy quality to this beer, and fruit.  Excellent finish: spicy and dry with a hint of fruit and spice.  Overall, an excellent approach to the Belgian pale ale.","  rDev No label information. Brewed in the style of a Belgian Pale Ale with Brettanomyces. Available in 12 oz. bottled 4 packs and in 750ml. bottles. This is the 2013 vintage release.  Poured from a 750ml. bottle to a tulip glass.  (Appearance) Pours a foamy frothed head of a pastel white tone over a moderately hazy golden amber body with speckled sediment in tow and light carbonation. Retention is very good and lacing is light and patchy. 4.25  (Smell) Pale and bread malts with a moderate impact of brettanomyces, generating a moderate funk, some soft sourness and rich, ripe fruit juice characters. Potency is moderate. 4  (Taste) Pale malts with a reserved sweetness, some slight bread body character, and subtle brettanomyces activity, very light, with small order of fruit, funk and sourness notable, highly drinkable and enjoyable, with delicate and graceful brettanomyces and yeast characteristics make for an enjoyable drinking experience. 4  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, lightly chewy, clean, medium dry. Carbonation is full, generating a medium frothiness and a briskly crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, shy of medium overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to tangy, fruit and acidity. Alcohol presence is light and there are no off characters. 3.75  (Overall) A solid Brettanomyces Pale Ale that does a great job at achieving balance while maintaining high drinkability. Matilda’s Brettanomyces character is one of the best developed examples that I’ve experienced in a beer, offering full fruit character and abundant acidity and tanginess without choking out the balance of the beer. Another well-crafted and regularly available gem by Goose Island. I recommend giving a couple of your bottles some time to mature as they have done so in my case quite gracefully. 4  Goose Island Brewing Co.’s Matilda Belgian Style Pale Ale 3.99/5.00","  rDev Current vintage ('16) on draft.  Pours a crisp orange color with a nice white head.   Lots of yeast in the aroma with notes of apricots and floral tones.   Flavor was initially some apricot and floral notes. Gives way to a very spicy yeast finish.   Feel was appropriate for the style. Crisp and light.   Overall a very nice belgian strong ale. One of the better american interpretations of the style.","  rDev I rate this about as I rate Sofie. Great Belgian style value for the buck. Try 24.   A: One finger of white head on a copper Mahogany hazy body, tiny bits of lace.   S: Wood, cedar, oak, citrus and orange rind with a deep Belgian must..  T: Follows smell, but more wood, incense, spice, and complexity. Corriander, orange citrus, Belgian yeast and toasted biscuits.  M: Tawny, medium body, with a real honey syrup feel, and moderate carbonation. Culminating in peppery, semi-dry finish.  Overall: Strong ale is right. Up there with Arrogant Bastard and Triples. It's a complex beer. One of the better beers from Goose.","  rDev Beautiful amber gold color with rich white lacing.  Aroma is brett influenced yeasty bready with full floral effect and a light touch of spicy hops.  Taste reveals a number of things, all good yet not fully knit together. Dried fruit on entry with spice notes appearing mid palate where a bit of malt richness also emerges, followed by some sour touches (in a good way) just before the finish. A fuller malt flavor in the lingering aftertaste that is then cut off by a reappearing gentle sour note.  Texture is reasonably full for a 7% golden ale.  Overall is a plus but more promise than performance. The elements are there for a really good beer experience but the parts are categorized, separate, as if they were in compartments rather than all working together. Like a team of talented players who are are not well coached each flavor seems to be doing it's own thing. Age of the bottle may be a factor but I've had this before and liked it better."]},{"Name":"Franziskaner Premium Weissbier","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/142/1946/","Brewery":"Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu","Style":"Wheat Beer - Hefeweizen","Alcohol":5.00,"Score":91.0,"Comments":["  rDev  Freshest before 8/18/22 ; drank 3/24/22 @ the Yarchives.

Banana candy shows clearly as well. A little formaldehyde in the aftertaste.  Relatively full bodied and prickly.  I suspect this is quite old. Wouldn’t review it at this age if they put clear dates on the bottles, but they don’t. It tastes like a decent beer that somebody put on a shelf for a year-and-a-half.

The body is a deep gold color with various shades of lighter gold and dull orange. The head is large, thick, and white with a rocky appearance. Pretty good head retention.  Aroma: There is a very faint clove aroma to the beer. Inhaling deeply gives more clove aroma and a touch of cardboard.  Taste: The overall flavor characters here are very mellow. Up front there is a very light banana character that comes through, which is slightly amplified in the middle of the mouth. There is a very light clove flavor towards the back of the palate. Nothing goes on in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: The body is at the upper edge of light. Carbonation feels fine. No bitterness. The beer is clean but largely absent of character.  Overall: As a whole the beer feels very average without much aroma, flavor, or character to give it an identity. The neckerchief does state  IMPORTED  so that could be a consideration. I probably wouldn't buy it again as an import but it's good enough to drink that I wouldn't turn it down. If I could buy it fresh and re-review the beer I would do so. I wouldn't recommend it as an import given the alternatives that are available, but it will do in a pinch.","  Another great German import...  Very rarely have I come across a German beer I did not like, and this one is yet another good one. What I liked was the mild but still flavorful taste. In it’s simplicity you find a truly enjoyable brew. If you get a chance grab one.","  rDev It looks like a disaster in the making. Two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It was quite the arduous process, as a volatile white head began occupying most of the space in the vessel. This, despite a very deliberate pour. When it receded, spotty bits of lacing were left on the inside of the glass. The color is a beautiful orange-amber, with almost the perfect degree of opaqueness. The smell is prefumy in the way of wheat beers and that’s all. The taste is clean and very mild, without much malt, nor hops. The body is thin, typical of wheat beers, but those who enjoy them find that refreshing. People that like a body and some hoppy or roasted malt taste in their beer will notice that these things are missing. This one is truly for those with the acquired taste for this style, who can discern the subtleties within.","  rDev (500 ml bottle). Typical hefe in any aspect: Appearance cloudy golden, enormous head, lovely aroma of ripe bananas and cloves, refreshing crisp flavour with cloves.

Smells of doughy malt and estery fruit and spice, with notes of banana and clove, as well as lighter, herbal hops. Taste follows the nose, with a decent balance of doughy malt, estery fruit and spice, with distinct banana and clove notes and lighter grassy and herbal hops. Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some clove, banana and lighter herbal hops lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This makes for an okay Hefeweizen, especially at the price point and availability, although it really isn't quite as rich and full as something by Weihenstephaner or Schneider. Despite a slightly watery feel there's still a decent balance of sweet malt, estery fruit/spice and bitter hops to this, while it just completely lack the full-bodiedness and roundness of a great Hefeweizen though, with the esters not feeling all that rich and the hops being a little too pronounced here, with a certain harshness that takes away from those esters a little.","  rDev 11.2oz bottle courtesy of the homeboy Simon  Tastes Smells Drinks amazingly.

Fruity banana, spicy clove and zesty yeast greet the tip of the tongue and mid-palate. The mid-quaff is also met with a bit of citrus and floral flavor. Cinnamon and some peppery notes arrive at the finish.   The brew is medium-light, with exceptional carbonation. This lends an excellent light crisp finish. Even so, the brew is remarkably smooth.  You may find a brew of this style that you like better, but this is a true, classic representation of the style.

Served in a tall, slender mug, this beer draws a cloudy, hazy medium golden color with a white head that’s about half an inch thick thick when first drawn and served. Settles to a fairly thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing unfortunately though. Aromas of some bready malts and then some wheat with definite clove and banana. The taste is pretty much the same, with some bready malts with a bit of caramel sweetness followed by wheat that gives way to the aforementioned banana and clove for additional sweetness and a spicy touch. Very slight trace of earthy and coral hops. Has a crisp, yet smooth, slightly frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish. A pretty solid representation of this style of beer.  Eric","  rDev Pours a cloudy golden orange color. An aggressive pour yielded a ginormous lathery foam head that spilled over. Once it dissipates, a layer of film and lacing retains throughout. The nose is big on banana, as well as complimentary aromas of lemon and orange peel. Aromas of bready malt, wheat and touches of yeasty phenols evoking clove. The taste follows the nose, especially midway as the banana and wheat flavors open up and yield sweetness. Spicy clove like phenols provide a nice balance, as does a subtle hops spice. Flavors of citrus peel add zest. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel and gentle carbonation. Clean finish with a malt and yeasty linger. This is a good example of Hefeweizen that is nicely balanced and has an easy to drink creamy mouthfeel.","  rDev Pours a hazy orange that turns turbid and murky when the final ounces are poured into the glass. Beer is a burnt-orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is moderate to poor. Aroma is lemon zest, clove, banana, and yeast esters layered over biscuity, nutty malts. It's really subtle, but still nuanced. Served chilled on a warm day, it's a welcoming smell. Flavor profile is nutty, biscuity malts with clove, lemon zest, banana, and yeast esters. Each sip opens up and folds out beautifully, despite being a smaller beer. Mouth feel is crisp and borders on harsh from the carbonation. It has a medium-thin consistency. Overall, a refreshing and flavorful hefe-weissen, which makes for a tasty sessionable beer.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 11.2oz bottle.","  rDev L- Deep amber, materially hazy, pours with 5-8mm head of fine bubbles that's very very slowly receding due to ongoing material rising CO2. S- Spicy, somewhere between cloves and cinnamon, nice. T- At first something akin to cinnamon, then slightly citrus, a slight 'zing' on the tongue comes next which has the clove-like element. F- Good CO2 in the mouth. This could be a decent higher-end year-round beer. It carries a pretty solid flavour, but it's also very refreshing. O- Nice stuff, if only if were cheaper in the UK. I recently lived in Berlin for 3 years and certainly drank this there before, (it cost about Euro1.20/500ml bottle there!) just realised I'd never rated it here. Nice to try again. BB: Sep-19.

Finishes on the sweeter side with some delicate lingering wheat base and banana, citrus, and light clove.  M - Thick and chewy with lots of sprightly carbonation up front on the tongue.

The main flavors upfront are of dry white wine complimented by a nice tart citrus, (orange and lemon peel) and subtle barnyard funk, with hay, toasted cracker, and a white pepper floating in the background. The wheat and effervescent carbonation give this a fluffy and extremely pleasant mouthfeel. It closes out on a perfect balance of the sweet-dry spectrum. A hint of sweetness to tantalize the taste buds but dry enough to beg the next sip. This brew is wonderfully made. Holy mackerel.

Poured into a stemless total wine glass. Hazy gold body, huge soapy white head off a gentle pour. Loose, large bubbles, bone white, slowly fall back to a 1/4  thin head that persists through the life of the beer. Large chunks of sediment despite an attempt to decant. Nose? Banana, bubble gum, peppercorns, candi sugars, candied lemon peel. A lot going on, complex, no diacetyl or dms, phenols out the wazoo. No hops to speak of. Yeast driven nose, everything else is buried. As it warms there is a slight white wine smell coming through. Taste, Bananas, bubble gum, alcohol, rock candy. Slight lemon on the aftertaste if I look hard. No hops, no grain, dry. As the beer warms there is a vineous note. Mouthfeel- thin bodied and dry. Phenols give a suggestion of sweetness as does the alcohol. Effervescent. Each sip bursts into small bubbles as it hits the palate. Overall. It's a well made beer, the yeast phenols push it into hefe territory for me. I much prefer Karmaleit when it comes to the style. Not sure why I got so much banana from this bottle.","  rDev Pours a cloudy bright orange color. Mostly opaque with a moderate amount of suspended sediment. Thick two finger white head forms on the beer, settles in, then dissipates leaving just a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. The aroma on this is lovely - it has notes of malts, white grape, apple, pear, some light banana, and some floral hop notes. Its subtle, refined, yet complex.   The taste follows the nose with notes of rich malts, belgian yeast that leans into the fruity side of things with notes of apple, pear, white grape and just a hint of banana. Along with the fruity notes come some spiced notes - clove, allspice and peppercorn. Moderately spicy, but not overly so. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish with a light floral character. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, and somewhat warming. Very carbonated with a bright, lively mouthfeel.   Overall this is an outstanding tripel and one I will absolutely revisit.","  rDev Pours a cloudy, golden amber coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head.

Taste is a great balance of caramel malt, fruity and slightly spicy esters, with notes of banana, apricot and clove, as well as lighter floral, bitter hops with hints of orange rind and toffee also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with some banana, orange rind and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.  This is actually the first time I've had this Tripel and while it is very good indeed, it doesn't quite reach Tripel Karmeliet or Chimay Tripel to me. The banana notes are quite at the forefront here, which I'm not a huge fan of, while the spice is noticeable, but a little subdued. Nevertheless there's a great balance of malts, hops and esters to this, with quite a rich and full body and mouthfeel as well. I was actually surprised by how much hops, relatively speaking, are left in this at just over one year old and would love to try it fresh sometime, which just might edge it a little closer to my aforementioned favorites. Also, considering that this has the highest ABV out of any Tripel I've tried so far, it really doesn't feel overly boozy at all.","  rDev Brouwerij Westmalle  Tripel  25.4 fl. oz. brown glass bottle  BEST BEFORE END: 2022/11/30 . Sampled on 2022/01/23. $11.99 @ Total Wine &amp; More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness: Another beer that's slipped by without me reviewing it. I used to drink a fair amount of this back in the days when craft breweries were few and far between, and I almost have to laugh because back then the big bottles of Belgians were the expensive beers! These days it's the American craft breweries that are taking all the dollars per ounce. It's poured a hazy golden body with a slight bit of an orange sheen beneath a massive head of rocky bright white foam. The head retention is amazing. It started at about an inch and a half tall, maybe more, and it's still an inch tall ten minutes later. Obviously the bubbles rising from below help, and I realize now that I've got it in a large Duvel tulip that's etched on the bottom to create nucleation points for the CO2. The aroma is fruity with apple and banana, a little spicy/woody/earthy (coriander, peppercorn, damp forest), and just lightly bready/biscuity and malty. It's not the boldest aroma in comparison to a lot of newer beers out there these days but you certainly won't miss it. Besides, why does a beer have to have a massive aroma anyway? On to the taste. I think, not surprisingly, that it tastes as it smells. It's fruity, a little sweetish (sugar, honey), cracker-like, peppery, subtly floral, and crisp and dry. There's an undertone of alcohol that enhances the peppery spiciness and bitterness, all of which work together to offset the lightly sugary sweetness and fruitiness. For being a beer that's made up of only golden malts it lingers for some time. In the mouth it's crisp due to the very fine-bubbled, natural, and effervescent carbonation. It warms to become slightly airy though, and creamier. I can't really tell where the body is because of the carbonation. On one sip it seems medium-light but on the next it flips to medium-full. I'll just go with medium for now. It's been a while since I've had this; the last time I think was in Roma, Italy in 2015 but it's mostly as I remember it - this one seems to have a little less banana, but that could just be my changing tastebuds. In any case, this is a classic of the style and basically fault-less. It might even have been the first golden tripel but don't quote me on that.

And I know this is considered a classic beer by many, so I'm very happy to finally try it. I never used to see it around anywhere beer shopping but it just popped up one day last month and I figured why not. Let's pop it open  Pours a cloudy dark gold with 2 fingers of creamy thick white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  There's a bit of an earthy funk in the nose in this one that I'm digging, it keeps it balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet pear, apple skin, wet hay, lemon zest, doughy malt, and overripe banana  The taste here is quite complex, but it all melds together very well to create a nearly crushable beer. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, lemon zest, white wine, candi sugar, white pepper, and light floral hops. The swallow brings notes of sweet doughy malt, white pepper, honey, clove, floral hops, and overripe banana  A medium body pairs with moderate fine carbonation, resulting in a downright drinkable beer for the abv.

It is time to right that wrong today! I do not like a triple that is overbearing, yeasty, and malty, yet many I have consumed lean this way. I have a hard time discerning what is the perfect balance. This beer is eight months old. This is newer than what I have consumed in the past. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a chalice. A lively head, but average retention. The massive three-fingered bubbly, airy, and creamy bright white head left some lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The head dropped two finger lengths but maintained for a moment. I wanted the head to stay massive and leave an abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale gold with amber yellow hues. The beer is somewhat cloudy with active carbonation. The appearance of the beer is average for this style.   The initial aromas in the beer are banana, cloves, spicy phenols, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect a floral bouquet, toasty bread, oranges, a touch herbal, a subtle fruity sweetness.   The flavors in the beer are oranges, peppery, cloves, banana esters, phenolic, herbal, honey-like sweetness, lightly toasted malts, crackers, perfumey hops, and floral undertone.   The mouthfeel of the beer is slightly warming with a high effervescent.   The body of the beer is medium, medium-high carbonation, and fuller finish.   I enjoy how beer starts off subtle, then slowly builds in flavor, and then a spicy peppery clove finish. The flavors of the beer are bright and contrasting. The malt in the beer is not overpowering but provides a firm backbone for this beer. I am honestly surprised by this beer. The beer is an excellent example of what a triple should be, disappointed I kept passing it up.","  rDev 11.2 oz. Bottle 4/20/21  A slightly white haze and orange tints inside the otherwise, golden liquid. Massive fluffy white and creamy foam cap goes on forever.  Yeasties funk aromas are sweet, tangy, tart, banana and cream dominated.   Sharp and tangy yeast bite is metallic and dry. Malt seems a bit thick, lazy amber, medium feel, sweet taste. Dry, very dry, except for a long and slick maltiness feel.   Boozy herbs and medicinal effects are a bit harsh, but certainly complex and unique.   A classic of the style that I much respect for.","  rDev Look: It pours golden with a white head. It has very good clarity.   Smell: It has a strong aroma of spice up front. There are low levels of pepper and oranges with a bit of grainy sweetness. There is a very low banana note well in the background.   Taste: It is very spicy with pepper being the strongest. There are clove notes as well. There are some orange notes and perfume like notes in the background. There is a grainy sweetness to it.   Feel: It has a medium body with an extremely dry finish.

No lacing.   Smell is a moderately strong , yeasty mix of banana extract, light spiciness, and a bit of crackery malt that fades with the head.   Taste is bread crust , a fruity flavor that is not-quite apple, (cooked) banana , very slight clove , and coriander+black pepper spiciness. Occasional brief flashes of barely-there , dried lemon. There is a solventy/liqueurish/alcoholic presence that all of the above is embedded within. Light bitterness , and a drying finish that lingers awhile.   Feel is initially smooth, with very,very fine moderate carbonation that comes in mid-way . Drying finish.  Overall, thoroughly enjoyable , as always. A classic , for good reason.","  rDev Appearance: Hazy gold, good, thick head.  Smell: Toast, cloves, hint of fruit. Not very aromatic.  Taste: Fruity, boozy, sweet, very carbonated, herbal.

BB May 28, 2021  Taken from a 44°F fridge, pour begins after ~5+ min.  Aroma is banana, spices, floral, sweet malts.  Color is gold, slightly hazy, plenty of rising bubbles to a 1/2 inch white, thick, and creamy-appearing head from a fairly gentle pour, which quickly falls to a 1/4 inch thick creamy cap.  Taste is spicey backed by the fruit tastes - banana, perhaps other indistinct (apple, maybe), with a solid sweet-ish floral backing. The spiciness is very peppery, and the banana and apple(?) carry throughout. The floral breadiness adds a lift to the taste that is quite nice. Little alcohol present in the taste, but you can definitely feel it about half way through. Only a very slight bitterness in the beginning that is pretty much gone by the middle. The finish is sticky and semi-sweet.  Medium feel, tilting to the thin side, but the primary feel is the carbonation tingling counteracting the creamy smoothness.  Overall, dangerously too easy to drink quickly given the ABV; I needed to consciously slow down, because I found it too enjoyable; I just wanted to just sip, sip, and sip again. An excellent tripel.","  rDev Poured from a bottle -opaque honey gold color with short white head leaving thin frosty lacing. Nose is a mix of floral,spice,yeast and banana.

Good lacing appears as the slowly drops. Smell is sweet malty candi sugar and light booze. Taste is almost identical to the aroma. Sweet malts candi sugar some alcohol.

Light bubble gum, fresh banana, and floral aromas with sugary fruit and caramel notes. Medium bodied with assertive, yet soft carbonation and pleasant, expanding warmth from the middle to the end. Fruity, malty and banana flavors up front with light bubble gum notes followed by medium light spicy bitterness. Malty and mellow peppery flavors on the back end that slowly expand to the end. Finished with light bubble gum and banana notes wrapped in spicy, peppery esters and a delayed dryness. Balance tips to the sweeter side with more fruity banana esters than spicy/peppery. Fabulous fresh aroma, feel and flavors.","  rDev A brooding beast of a monastic beer (ironic?).

The beer pours hazy light amber with an orange tint and and a fair amount of yeast particulate. The head is nearly white in color and rises quickly with a gentle pour. It recedes to a thin cap of tiny bubbles leaving a full lacing. The aroma is banana and bubblegum with some spicy notes as well. The taste is candy like malt with immediate peppery notes and a finish that fades toward dry with a clove kick. Very little bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with well above average carbonation. It's never cloying or sugary sweet and the finish is amazingly dry for the initial feel. No perceptible alcohol in the taste or aroma. Overall, excellent. Fantastic beer and a standard for the style. I should have been even more gentle on the pour so I won't dock for the floaties. (Original review 2/25/19)  Second bottle with same date sampled 7/31/19. A gentle pour reduces, but doesn't eliminate the floaties.","  rDev 33cL bottle distributed in the Dutch Caribbean market, clearly not very fresh on the shelf, but still dated best before 12/12/19. Served in a tapered tumbler. Beer is turbid and yellow, within a small amount of white head. Aroma is yeasty and lemony, and maybe a bit of candied citrus peel in the nose. Flavor has a great spice to it, a bit of caramel sweetness, but a very dry finish. Residual carbonation is high, which helps to cut through the thick and creamy body, and elevate the fruity esters. No sign of ethanol anywhere. Not the most complex Belgian tripel, but this is a very, very good beer, not to mention a classic.","  rDev ** 12/31/2018  Bottle to wine glass.  Big frothy head. Excellent retention. Banana bread, fruitcake. Yeast. Light esters.   **","  rDev Light copper colored and hazy with plenty of sediment floating about. There's a fingernail of dishwater white around the rim and covering most of the top. The aroma is of light Belgian candy sugar and light sweet Belgian malt. I'm tasting sweet light Belgian malt and light Belgian candy sugar. The mouth is light, crisp, dry, and refreshing.","  rDev Amazing tripel! Poured from bottle to Westmalle chalice. I honesty can't believe I haven't had this one before, or at least I haven't written a review. Classic tripel pour: clear, dark yellow, and effervescent. Lots of soapy foam. Big aromas of banana and bubble gum, bread and yeast cake. Flavors explode: bubble gum, banana, clove, spice, bread. Sharp and clean. Prickly carb feel on the tongue. Favor tripel ratings: Tripel Karmeliet, Dragonmead Final Absolution, Unibroue Fin Du Monde, then Westmalle.","  Pours a burnt-orange with two fingers of white foam that has a moderate retention rate. Aroma is Belgian yeast spice, clove, bananas, butterscotch and orange zest. Flavor profile is more butterscotch with a yeasty, spicy finish. Clove and bread are evident. Mouth feel is velvety, with a spicy finish. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, a full Trappist triple ale that holds up well.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 11.2oz bottle.","  rDev Bottled on: 11/23/16 Best Before: 11/23/18  A: Amber colored beer that is translucent with a slight haze. A frothy, white head upon pouring that disappears over time, but that leaves a good amount of sticky lacing along the side of the glass. Minute bubbles of carbonation are visible throughout the entire drink.  S: The nose is sweet. Banana bread, overly ripened banana, butterscotch, toffee, burnt sugar. The alcohol is present.  T: The flavor is sweet, but there are some different things going on that prevent it from being too sweet for me. On the tip of the tongue you get similar notes found in the aroma, including the sweet banana, butterscotch, toffee, burnt sugar, nutmeg spiciness. While these flavors also carry throughout the palate, I am also getting some brighter notes of pear, some date, dried apricot. There is also a prominent bitterness, which prevents the beer from becoming too sweet.  M: Nice creaminess to the feel, with some moderate carbonation. The carbonation is not prickly, but rather it is more smooth. Warming presence on the palate and stomach from the alcohol.   D: Overall, this is a highly drinkable Belgian Tripel. It has some sweetness to it that is somewhat, although not completely offset by brighter, fruiter notes and bitterness. At $10.99 for a 750mL, I would make this a go to over the course of an evening any time. I picked this up today along with a couple others beers that I have not had in a number of years. I am glad that I decided to revisit this one.","  rDev This one should be a go to. Like, ordering a double meat, w/ onion, mustard instead of spread, add chile pepper at In N Out, go to. Like a Josephine Skriver centerfold, there is nothing wrong with this thing. Luscious, supple, buxom...  Pop the cap and give it a pour, my children. It doesn’t get better than this.","  rDev Very nice beer! Very fragrant: sweet, floral and fruity. The taste is of fruit like rich pears with a delicate sweetness. Nice honey notes. Beautiful head and lacing atop a slightly cloudy yellow body.   This is one of those beers that sometimes makes you think you should just stick with the classics!","  rDev Poured into a tulip glass. Golden and hazy in the glass. A billowing white head with great retention and lacing. The aroma featured the yeast, floral esters, clove, and candy.

Lacing is pretty good. Nose is a mix of toast, spice, and yeasty notes including a little bubble gum. The toasted grain lays a nice foundation for a mix of orchard fruit jam and fall spices. The opening feel is nice, punching in around medium with a softness, but the carbonation ends up a little less restrained than the head it helps produce. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with quite complimentary flavors.","  rDev This is a bottle from 2011, so please take that into account with this review.   It pours a muddy reddish-brown that seems to be in line with fresh, but not much of a head. Clears decently as it warms up.  The smell is fruity, both the raison fig contingent and some nice apple. Slightly spicy, peppery, heavy on the bread. Very weak banana when fully warmed.  The taste opens sweet and spicy, black pepper and coriander. The pepper sensation lingers thru and continues well after the swallow. The sweetness morphs into the fig/raisin fruit thing rather nicely. I thought the malty bready notes would be stronger, but they show up almost as a third layer of flavor. There's a toffee flavor that I think can be chalked up to age. It's kind of a subdued malt bomb where the malt is strong, but the supporting cast gets equal billing.  Mildly carbonated, peppery tingle lingers, sweet but not sticky, and towards the dry side despite the sweet part.  Overall, this tastes pretty fine. I'd buy it again based on how it tastes now. I'm feeling it has lost some edge but has mellowed into something pleasant.","  rDev Cloudy deep amber, nice off-white head, good retention and lace Rum-soaked raisins, some caramel, a bit of warm spice Golden raisins, light caramel, warm spices, a hint of green banana Medium-light bodied and appropriately carbonated Really good dubbel","  rDev Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.

I picked this up at a local beer store recently to keep checking off Beers of Fame! The beer pours a fairly clear amber to mahogany color with a fluffy beige colored head of about 3 cm. This foam fades slowly leaving some sticky lattice on my glass.  The aroma has some light caramel malt and a bit of cloves and light cinnamon. No real hop presence and the 8% booze is hidden too. the nose is sort of mild overall, but is appealing and works for the style. The first sip reveals a medium body with slightly syrupy texture and fine tingly carbonation. Feels like its a little bit of a bigger beer.  Flavor is malty up front with caramel and some brown sugar and then rolls to a bit of green apple hit and quickly gives over to spices of clove and cinnamon. I get a bit of black pepper bite on the finish and mild warming booze on the swallow. This is a fun beer to revisit after quite a hiatus. Im going to circle back to many of the Unibroue line again. This is worth a sampling for a Dubbel with some spiciness.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a slightly hazy dark amber with a modest white head that soon reduces to a nice ring.

After a few minutes, the spiciness begins to become the most prominent part of the aroma.   Feel is on the thin side of moderate, but quite effervescent.

Robust sweetness up front that's bolstered and supported by hearty malts. Flavor profile is less thick and sticky, but more focused - hitting notes of toffee, dark fruits, caramel, banana, clove, and caramely, toasty, bready malts. It breaks apart a little the palate, coming along more in a thin, consistent line vs. the flavor blast of the aroma. Mouth feel is medium-thick with an expansive, fuzzy texture that carries the expansive flavor profile well. Overall, depth and complexity without lingering or sticking qualities.

Like most of their brews out of this 12-pack the look was quite opaque, not entire so, but hazy enough to make it difficult to look through. It had a light head, no staying power, and just a touch a lacing but that's being generous. The smell was a very complex - boozy, sweet, with yeast foundation that all worked quite well with each other. Mouthfeel was full-bodied and though considerably carbonated not so much that it detracted from the overall experience. Speaking of that, the taste was a nice blend of booze, a touch of caramel sweetness to my buds, and the distinctive base that comes with dark ales.

Aroma - Big whiff of sweet molasses, big caramel malts, plum, fig, raisin, burnt sugar and oak.  Taste - Nose is much sweeter than the well balanced taste. combination of sweetness from molasses, brown sugar rich maltiness. Nice barrel coming through, great dark fruit plum and fig. Such well balanced flavors.  Feel - Medium bodied, creamy slightly warming feel other than that the alcohol is well hidden.   Overall - Just a well done old ale, great flavors well balanced and really easy drinking.","  rDev Very nice golden-amber color, nice head with some lingering lacing. Smells of malt, caramel and some mild hops. Tastes of some floral and citrus zest hops, caramel, biscuit with strong malt backbone. Nice smooth mouthfeel that was slightly creamy. Small amount of carbonation and alcohol taste comes through a fair amount. Great beer but a little heavy and would likely be hard to drink multiples.","  rDev Quick: Look is quite nice, amber gold with a nice finger worth of head. Retention is good, and lacing is quite nice. The smell is really damn nice, lovely malts, treacle, fruits and then a finish of hops. Flavor follows the nose, this is a malt lover's paradise. The sweetness is not cloying at all, but rather works with the beer making everything else jump out too. The feel is full heavyweight that coats the mouth nicely. Carbonation is low, and you can feel the booze. This is a damn nice old ale. I would have as much of this as I could find if possible, but that just isn't possible. I will always seek this one out.","  rDev 2014 Vintage","  rDev Notes from 2012 and 2017 are eerily similar, and they wouldn't be much different from more recent tastings.  L: This one has a brassy edge to an otherwise thick, dense red-orange. It grows a fluffy copper-tinged head with lots of density to it and plenty of stick. S: Sweetness on the nose, brown sugar and dark fruits with heavy malts, a whiff of heat, and a bit of spicy hops. Lots of complexity. T: The complexity carries to the flavor, and I find it delicious rather than muddled. Sweet, a bit hoppy, bready, and tinny all at once, it really moves across the palate. Alcoholic heat is certainly present but not overwhelming. Spice, floral notes, lots of fruit and caramel, some molasses, and a bit of dough. F: Smoother than one might expect in a medium body, plenty of bite with a light sting and, when fresh, a hint that it could go sticky or cloying but I find it stopping just short of doing so.","  rDev Like Columbus sailing the ocean blue, this is epic. Rich, old flavors like your grandma playing plinko, I’m into this. All around solid like the one you took this AM.","  rDev Tap  Pours clear amber, yellowish white film for a head retains indefinitely.  Aroma is rich caramel, molasses, biscuit, and toffee.  Tastes of biscuit, toffee, caramel, molasses, a bit of smoke, oak, bourbon, and tobacco.  Medium to full body, light tingly carbonation on the tongue. Booze warmth going down.  Very nice, rich flavor with a mix of sweet and earthy elements. A slow sipper but well worth the time.","  rDev Curmudgeon brings some nice toffee and hoppy notes. Some molasse is present too. The oak aging brings some woody and vanilla notes as well. An enjoyable brew. They won't brew it in 2018 so I'm glad I had the chance to try this one in 2017","  rDev 12oz bottled 1/13/15 (cellered 3 years) poured into a snifter at fridge temp 9.8% ABV. The beer pours a murky muddy brown color with minimal off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves no lacing. The aroma is dark sugar, oak and some booze. The taste is warming caramel candy with some oak, vanilla and booze in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and surprisingly dry in the finish. Overall, very good. I wasn't a fan of this fresh as the molasses was overpowering. It has evolved over three years into a fantastic old ale. Too bad it's out of production.","  rDev A chestnut brown like pour, is this related to Backwoods Bastard? I know there is Dirty Bastard, then barrel aged = backwoods, but this? I dunno. Looks similar to those. Lighter tan head 1/2  deep. Aroma of oak, molasses, brown, Maris otter malt feels.   Taste, oooh a nice rich sipper. Plenty of caramel, molasses like sweetness matched up with oak and a hefty malt bill that is still plenty shy of porter/stout territory. I'm getting light smoke as if this oak was from a bourbon barrel stave. Alcohol pretty well hidden. Not bitter, not hopped up. Its like a lower hopped English barleywine even. Totally recommend this to someone who likes their beers smooth and strong and is opposed to hoppy or sour stuff. This is a malt forward beer well suited for a cold night.","  rDev This is a '14 from a crowler, so ..... might skew things a bit.  Pours clear chestnut-brown, similar to thin, watery coffee, when I forget how many scoops I put in, &amp; come up light. ; ) Quickly-dissipating off-white head.   Aroma is slightly nutty malt, lightly boozy, &amp; dried fruit, a la brandy.   Flavor is wood,pecan, &amp; dried stone fruits, and (fermented honey - like a mead) finishing with slight pleasant astringency &amp; bitterness.   Light, moderately oily, with very fine carbonation. Overall quite smooth.  Overall, this aged version is an (dangerously ; ) )easy-drinking, wonderful sipper, that I can't get enough of.","  rDev Poured from draft into a tall tulip glass at a local tavern. Beautiful clear mahogany with a nice beige head and great lacing. Nice woodsy, boozey smell that follow into the taste. The flavor of vanilla, toffee and a bit of candied orange. Nice oak notes as well. Very enjoyable!","  rDev Merky amber with small fluffy off white head. The aroma is fruity yeast, tons of apricot, molasses and a Carmel burnt brown sugar toffee and bread crust. The flavor is sweet, there's a full malt flavor that is largely toffee and bread crust. There's this mild oakiness and a bitter dry finish.  It's full bodied and about perfect for the style. Overall it's solid nothing spectacular, but I love old ales and this one is very enjoyable.","  Another new Founders sip for me and I think the first ''old ale'' I am trying.  Poured this 12oz bottle into a mug, the ethanol make it a bit harder to sip on it than others from Founders. I like it, just having a hard time finishing it.  A peculiar style that may not be for every palate.","  rDev From Labirratorium. In Teku glass. Playing 12 Labours of Hercules 4 + Little Big Adventure Enhanced. Very alcoholic in both nose and mouth, and the oak aging seems to make it feel even more alcoholic. Bbf Nov 2016. It has been hard to finish","  rDev $ 12.36 (Including tax)/4 pack ($ 0.258/oz) at Oppermann’s at Saginaw, MI. Bottled 12/30/16. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Aroma – faint oak and some malt and molasses. Head large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive pour), tan, dense and creamy, good retention slowly diminishing to an irregular four to seven mm frothy ring a d a frothy partial layer. Lacing – good. Partial rings of tiny to small bubbles. Body – amber, cloudy. The cloudiness appears to be mostly chill haze as it thins out as the beer warms. Flavor – begins slightly sweet but ends slightly bitter. Some oakiness bust mostly caramel maltiness. Molasses is faint to non-existent. A hint of diacetyl. No alcohol in the flavor but almost immediately a gastric burn begins.  Palate – full, creamy, soft carbonation.  Another excellent high octane brew from Founders, with the added benefits of being relatively cheap as well as aging well.  Appearance 4.25, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4.5, Overall 4.5.","  rDev Founders Curmudgeon, 9.8% ABV, 50 IBU. Pours copper and thick, with a three finger off-white head. Nose is malty, fruity, and sweet, taste follows plus burnt caramel and mole asses with a slight carbonation burn and a bit of bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall outstanding.","  rDev Pours a blonde color forming into a raspberry ruby with a nice milky, frothy head of 1/2 finger.   Aromas of oak barrel, molasses, raspberry, ginger, and stone fruit.   Flavor is very stiff, quite woody, ashy even; with a high alcohol presence and slight bubble gum. Vanilla is present but only like someone sunk a vanilla-roma tree in the fermenter. Not much on the molasses or licorice side of things.   Feel is slick and slightly resiny, with a tight carbonation and an oily finish.   Overall, everything about the Curmudgeon is good except for the flavor, and that's the most important part. I'll have to regretfully pass always.","  rDev Keg dated 3.2.15 (2 years aged) 32 oz growler poured into a snifter. Purchased at Trenton Road Take Out in Levittown, PA.  Appearance Bright ruby red. Very short head that dissipates quickly. Light carbonation.  Nose Cherry, molasses, toffee, caramel, tobacco, and vanilla.  Taste Caramelized sugars, maraschino cherry, molasses, toffee, and vanilla. Tobacco and a slight earthiness. Suggestions of concord grape, raisin, and prune. Has a touch of oak and a warming alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel Medium bodied, silky, smooth, and warming.  Overall Old Ales don't get much better than this!","  rDev Poured from a single-serve.  Pours a dark amber with not much head, but excellent sticky lacing throughout.  The aromas are very unique and diverse. The best part of the brew.  Dark  notes like molasses and dark fruits, mixed with floral notes and vanilla. Hints of bourbon.  The taste is elusive and more like a barleywine than an OA. Sweet at the very front (similar to the nose--molasses, burnt sugar, vanilla, bourbon), but with a good punch of hoppy bitterness, and oaky and boozy elements at the finish. Enough going on to be  complex  but it comes across as a rather muddled assemblage of flavors, not a symphony. It is almost like there are three or four different concepts going on and they aren't blended into one cohesive theme.   The mouthfeel is fairly unremarkable and perhaps the most disappointing part of the brew. Rather flat, and lacking in a describable finish.  There are some good intentions here, but this is a miss for me.","  rDev Pours a deep Amber color with a one inch head that left little lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak and molasses. Taste gets significantly better and richer as it warms with dominant flavors of molasses and oak with additional notes of vanilla, bourbon, cherries and caramel. Lightly carbonated, medium to thick mouth feel, smooth, a real sipping beer.","  rDev At this point, it's fair to call Curmudgeon a classic old ale. Rich amber in color with good acidity and strong malt backbone. When fresh, the molasses imparts a touch of sweetness to counter the sharpness of the base beer without producing a sugar bomb; some of the intensity is also due to the ageing, which imparts nice flavors of sassafras root and birch bark. Strong in flavor while remaining balanced and complex, all at a favorable price point.","  rDev I finally got my hands on one of these! Out of the bottle it pours a copper/amber color with a bubbly and thumbnail length off white head. Retains well as it leaves some lacing and nice looking cloud like patterns of film. I think the nose is my favorite part of this brew. Buttery, tofee, caramel and honey sweetness. There is a lot of fruitiness going on too; I detect honeydew, cantaloupe or melon in particular. There is also some toasted malt tones that fade in and out. Towards the end there is a mild grassy and clean alcohol aroma. Overall the mouthfeel is sweet and with other complex elements to balance things out. It would be interesting to see how this ages. It tastes like spicy dark and tropical fruit soaked in alcohol; in this sense it has some DIPA or barley wine qualities. The sweetness is derived also from honey and caramel like qualities from the malt. Medium to full bodied and chewy. A sipper, yet drinkable at the same time. There is a touch of spicy hops in the finish, as well as alcohol warming, that becomes increasingly dry and moderately bitter.  This was a fun and tasty high ABV brew that is drinkable, albeit you can only really have one at a time. I will try to get another one as soon as I can so that I can experiment with aging.","  rDev I'm reviewing a 2016 version. It pours a nice translucent brown with a small, light brown head leaving nice lacing. The smell is malt, molasses, and some vanilla. The taste is dark fruits first followed by some sweet molasses. There is a smooth, low carbonation mouthfeel. Overall this is a nice, easy to drink beer that I really enjoy.","  rDev Bottled 4/1/14; drank 4/12/15 @ the Yarchives.   Murky orange/plum appearance.   A rough pour yielded a nice khaki head; nice lace.   Plum, baking soda &amp; brown sugar notes in the nose.   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Dried plum flavor up front; a dry baking soda finish. Booze heat emerged as this warmed. Not very good.","  Pours a murky, deep bronzed-burgundy with two fingers of khaki head. Poured straight into the glass slowly. Head retention is good, with good lacing left behind. Head forms quickly and eagerly. Aroma is caramel, toffee, molasses, with toasted, nutty malts. Flavor profile is caramel, molasses, and toffee with toasted and nutty malts as well. Caramel and molasses are at the front, keeping it sugary, but well balanced with the nutty and toasted malts at the back. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a slightly fizzy and grainy feel. Overall, a lively old ale with lovely notes throughout.   Served in a teku.","  rDev This is a 2014 bottle that pours a dark brown color with just a cap of head. Smell is wonderful, molasses, vanilla, malt, and some dark fruits. Taste is bready malt, molasses, and vanilla.

Initial impression is lemon, bready malt, and a touch of slightly bitter floral hops. Mouthfeel is clean and refershing. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. I thought I was going to be drinking an IPA, so the wheat was a surprise (note to self: try to actually read what's on the can next time). So maybe my palate was primed for an IPA, but I honestly didn't find 312 Urban Wheat too enjoyable.","  rDev Pours a hazy orange that turns a light-bulb beyond into a dull hot circle, much like the sun on a lightly clouded dad. Head is a finger in height and stark-white in color. Aroma is wheat, barley, straw malts out front with herbal, floral, and leafy hops mingled between. There is a light citrus rind at the finish. Flavor profile is straw, barley, wheat, bready, earthy and nutty malts and floraly, leafy and citrusy hops. It's rich in full terms of the broadness of its notes, while still retaining balance and not overloading the palate. Mouth feel is a touch effervescent, but stills out on the palate. It has a medium thickness. Together, it forms a lightly crisp, but certainly refreshing, texture. Overall, big malts and fair hops keep this beer drinking smooth and balanced, especially considering the ABV.   Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev From the can, it pours a lightly hazy golden amber color with a modest, quickly diminishing head. In the nose, it is light with some bread and citrus coming through.

Smells and tastes of lemon, bready malts, grass, wheat and floral notes. Light bodied, well carbonated, watery mouth feel, minimal bitterness and a slightly dry finish. Overall a pretty poorly executed beer.","  rDev L - Cloudy, straw-coloured, highly carbonated. S - Pretty mild, a hint of citrus, that's all I get. T - Not quite 'sharp' but quite hard/clean on the front. It's disappointing that nothing else seems to develop from there.  M - I am getting a lot of CO2 coming out in the mouth, in fact too much it's quite OTT. O - This is a curious beer. It's from AB InBev (brewers of Budweiser and other 'factory brands'), who've packaged it up like it's from some quaint rural craft beer company. Perhaps it's their attempt to muscle in on the premium/$ craft scene. Unfortunately this beer struck me as entirely underwhelming (x-ref AB's Budweiser). The only time this beer might have a use is as a refresher on a very hot day, but it seems to offer absolutely nothing of interest or note, and hence there's no reason to buy it again.","  rDev Surprisingly enough this is my first time trying the 312 Urban Wheat. It's pretty unremarkable, with decent wheat flavor and a moderate citrusy/floral hop presence. Would be enjoyable enough at the beach or a baseball game.","  rDev Tallboy can from the LCBO; packaged Mar 13 2018. Brewed in Montreal for the Canadian market and served barely chilled.  Pours a bright, sunny golden-yellow colour; effervescent, too, and it's all topped off by an inch of puffy, resilient white head. Great retention, but it does wilt eventually - somewhere between 5-10 minutes later - leaving a thick coat of foamy lacing behind in its wake, not to mention a creamy collar and soapy cap. Looks fantastic, but I've not got much to say about the nose - lemon peel/zest, cereal grains and a generalized wheatiness are about all I can pick out. Smells clean, and appropriate for the style.  A passable light wheat ale; it tastes mostly of gritty, grainy pale barley malts and wheaty bread. It also has a bit of syrupy/honey sweetness that I don't find to be beneficial, as it distracts from the faint hints of citrus zest and grassy straw that can barely be perceived towards the back end. Light in body, with middling carbonation levels that soften considerably as you make your way into the glass - perhaps not as crisp as I'd like, but very smooth. One thing I can never take away from this beer is the fact that it is eminently easy to drink quickly.  Final Grade: 3.65, a B grade. 312 Urban Wheat is not what I'd call Goose Island's best mainline offering, but this sort of stuff has its place on the shelves. I mean, let's be honest - it's basically a light beer, and viewed in that context this is a much more palatable option than the other macro alternatives. It's not really something I see myself buying with any sort of frequency - personally, I'd prefer their Four Star Pils - but that's no reason not to give it a try yourself.","  rDev March 14 2019","  rDev Poured from a can into a pint glass.

Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.  The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.  This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive.

This ale does have an excellent, smooth mouthfeel with well hidden ABV.","  Pours a medium coppery amber with a big, three finger whitehead with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops with a little dankness, orange, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus, piney and dank hops, grapefruit, orange, pine needles, mixed tropical fruit. Citrus rind and fresh pine finish with a deep hop bitterness that is more assertive than abrasive. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I think I would have loved this even years ago, but it is even more welcome now with all the mild, soft hopped hazy ales that are so popular now. This is what I want in an IPA: great herbal hop flavors melded to aggressive alpha oil character. And this delivers. The strong ABV brings out the flavors to a fine degree. This is close in profile to a triple IPA / American barleywine depth. The combo of pine, citrus and dankness is great. It even looks like it will pack a flavor punch. This is a legend for good reason. Although we have fine IPAs in this area, I'd buy this regularly if it was available on the market here.","  rDev 16oz can from Brewers Haven. I didn't get the chance to hit Surly when I was in MN, so I'm glad we're finally seeing distro here. This one of the beers that put them on the map, and it's a throwback to the old days of in your face hoppiness. Dark golden pour with a lasting soft, foamy head. You can detect a hint of caramel malts in the aroma before the hops take over. Taste begins and ends with the hop bitterness, woody, piney, sharp. This what DIPAs used to taste like. Thanks for the memories.","  rDev Clear dark amber in the St. Bernardus globe with plenty of foam. Some sweetness followed by an attack on the tongue and other sensory organs. Burnt mango, grapefruit pith, It's got everything, including onions and cat pee. It's weird how this is all high notes, as in shrilling piccolo. I even think of the smell of a dry sauna with the wood and sweat. Hot, intense, acidic. It's all peel, no fruit.   As I observed in a long ago review of one of their other beers,  The insistent hot and resiny taste with an unforgiving bitterness seems like the Surly signature.  From the 16 oz can purchased on the West coast.  Canned on 12/12/20  it says on the bottom, so not quite a month old.","  rDev Look: It pours dark yellow and clear with an off white head. Head retention is good.   Smell: It has strong aromas of grapefruit and pine. There are some low resinous qualities to it with additional citrus hints.   Taste: There are grapefruit, pine, and bready flavors. There are additional other citrus flavors with resinous elements and very low melon.   Feel: It has a medium body with strong hop bitterness in the finish.   Overall, a traditional hop bomb, but not overdone or overly sweet. The flavors are well defined and the finish is pleasant and long lasting.","  rDev Glad to finally see this around the triad.Pours into an imperial nonic a clear medium golden with a thinner white head that left a few broken 'globs' of lace as it settled pretty quickly.You get the grapefruit sharpness in the nose along with some hefty resin,slightly boozy.Citric but with a zesty punch on the palate,not like Tang ,resinous on the back end and never overly sweet.Bring on the resin!Love the beer it's not overly sweet and boozy,and again it's not like drinking citrus punch.","  rDev 16 oz can into a tulip glass.  Pours a cloudy amber gold color with 2 fingers of effervescent off-white head. Decent retention. Leaves a good amount of sticky lacing before settling into a thin cap of foam.  The aroma is very citrusy up front, bringing notes of grapefruit, lemon and orange juice. There's some subtle tropical notes as well, namely fresh honeydew melon. Nice amount of pine and sweet, doughy malt.  The flavor follows the nose: A huge wave of grapefruit and candied orange with a surprising honeydew melon punch. The sweet, grainy malt character is very much present. There's even a very subtle note of almonds in the back. Finishes piney, grassy, earthy and bitter. Absolutely a hop grenade but extremely well-balanced.  Feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and smooth with just a hint of booze. Dry with a lingering coating of bitterness.  Overall, this beer definitely lives up to the name, as well as the hype. The hops punch you in the face, but apologize afterwards with a sweet malt character. Fruity, yet earthy and bitter. The ABV is very well-hidden.","  rDev 16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 10/29/20, so a little over 6 weeks old.  Looks spectacular in the glass. Slightly hazy yellow with hints of amber body. Small white head persists in good form throughout, impressive given the abv. The lacing is simply superb, thick rings throughout.  Strong aroma of tropical fruit.  On tasting, well, the name certainly fits the beer. A strong bitter grapefruit peel assault on the mouth. But here's the thing. The malt base is also very strong, giving a sweet fruity wash that ebbs and flows with the grapefruit. Loving this.  Mouth very close to full. The finish is somehow the exact opposite of the taste, a slight sweet fruity hit followed by a lasting dry grapefruit bitterness.  Overall, just an outstanding and complex old school double ipa. Happy to have grabbed a 4-pack, sorry not to have grabbed 2 or 3","  A: Pours a golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing  S: A good mix of citrus and pine up front along with some lighter tropical fruit notes and light malt  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a wave of citrus and candied hops and then picks up the tropical fruit and pine. Moderate but aggressive bitterness that is balanced by some malt. Finishes with lingering candied citrus  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A very good DIPA that is simply a classic, must-try brew. Aggressive, but still on the easier side to drink. Again, a must-try","  rDev Pours a golden straw color with almost a finger of head. The nose has some tropical fruit notes but it is much more muted than I expected based on this beer's reputation. The flavor profile has a solid malt backbone with definite notes of tropical fruits mixed in. The finish is a fine bland of hop bitterness and residual sweetness.  This is a very good offering but, based upon the name, I expected an assertive resiny and sharp piney quality. That didn't happen.","  rDev Picked up a single from Kings Beer &amp; Wine 12-18-19 for $4.19. Canned on 10-31-19; consumed on 2-17-20.  Beer poured a golden orange with a nice white head with the original pour.  Nose is old school double IPA, not the hop burst you get today but a beautiful combo of the sweet malts infused with grapefruit, orange, and mango.  Taste is awesome! Huge malt base meets a Citra dominated hop addition with orange, mango, and grapefruit balancing nicely. Finishes with a solid bitterness; 8/10 on my scale.  Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied and very smooth.  Overall a wonderful old school DIPA that is big and flavorful but not the old school booziness. Well made! I will definitely seek out a four pack next fall!","  rDev From a tall aluminum can m this brew is a hazy, dark straw color with a thin white head. The aroma is very fruity...citrus and melon....orang and lemon peel and some fleshy grapefruit. Full bitter and aggressive flavor. Some alcohol warmth. Full body. Satisfying.","  rDev A - Pours a lightly hazed amber with a two finger creamy white head. Heavy amount of soapy lacing.  S - Aroma is tangerine, grapefruit rind, caramel and piney hops.  T - The taste is tangerine, mango, grapefruit, caramel malts, toasted biscuit and piney hops.  M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish.  O - A classic DIPA.","  rDev Surly Abrasive DIPA. 9.2% ABV. Pours brown with a one-finger off-white head that left no lacing. Nose is caramel, fruit, malt, slight pine. Taste is slightly sweet caramel, heavy pine, tropical fruit, with a moderate to stiff bitter close. Excellent mouthfeel, overall outstanding.","  rDev Poured from a pint can into a tulip  The aroma is darker than apricot, lighter than copper or amber. A dark golden hazy masterpiece. A decent one-finger head gives way to a persistent skein of froth and faint lacing.  Aromas of mango, pineapple, peach/nectarine, apricot, white plum, white grape, berry, and lemon/lemongrass, with hints of white pepper and clear alcohol. Just a touch of pine/resin. The brew has a nice complex aroma, but it is somewhat subdued. In other words--good, but it would be nice to have more of it.  The aromas were skewed more  sweet ; the flavors are decidedly more bitter, but not unpleasantly so. Very well balanced, actually. Plenty of malt backbone greets the tip of the tongue, with peach, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple all present. The mid-palate is greeted with more malty sweetness, balanced with grainy/biscuity goodness before transitioning to piney and dank hop notes. The finish features a return of white peppery goodness and a touch a booze. The ABV is very well hidden.   The brew is medium bodied, with excellent carbonation, and never gets sticky, as brews of this ABV can sometimes be. This one almost gets to  crisp  level in its finish.  This is an excellent American DIPA. Well-balanced in every way.","  rDev Dark, golden body with a dense, rocky, frothy head; sticky globs of foam clinging to the inside of the glass. Dank and pungent aroma; pine resin. Huge pine and hop bitterness taste; earthy spices. Heavy body; crisp, dry and prickly on the palate; rather dry on the palate but with some prominent yet balanced sweetness.  This is an eye popping double IPA, crisp and punchy. The IBUs definitely grab you with a hearty hop bitterness. If you want a powerhouse, old school IPA, give this beer a try...","  rDev On tap at the Happy Gnome. An easy drinking DIPA.","  rDev Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing CO pint glass  A: Pours slightly hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick spots of lacing.   S: Monster hop aroma, mix of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, and some spicy herbal notes, backed with bready malt and caramel sweetness.   T: Nice balance of fruitiness and bitterness. Opens tropical, passion fruit, a hint of mango and melon, citrus, tangerine and grapefruit, resinous pine, floral and spicy herbal notes, bready malt, and caramel sweetness. A touch of alcohol can come through as it warms.   M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, just a touch of warmth.  O: My can was a gift from a buddy when he went back to visit his frigid homeland. Pretty stoked he snagged it for me and it's drinking mighty fine, despite approaching the 3 month mark. I can only imagine what it was like fresher, but you can tell they packed this to the brim with hops given how well it's held up.","  rDev Barely hazy golden beer with a sticky head. The aroma is yeasty, malty, fruity and piney. The taste is sweet, grassy, citrusy and super bitter. Nice medium mouthfeel with great carbonation. Glad to have finally tried this and a welcome break from the many NEIPAs I’ve been drinking.","  rDev Lots of pine in this awesome DIPA. It pours dark amber with a red-like hue. The aroma and flavor profile are dominated by pine and grassy notes. The malt base is awesome and balances the intense bitterness very nicely. Full bodied. ","  rDev Body is just faintly sandy of haze with a large but light off-white foam that dies much quicker than you think to a thin ring leaving some sporadic fuzzy lace.  Smell is a divine and complex hop cocktail coming on like orange liqueur and triple sec, but far more complex and wild, with herbal accents, green yet woody pine and a butterscotch-like malt.  Taste is tangy and deeply complex with stinging hops counteracted by a nice malt presence that simultaneously does not interfere with too much flavor. Plenty of room is left for all sorts of different citrus, evergreen, allium and wild herbs. I even get a hint of mint, and again the malt is a sort of graham-butterscotch deep in the background.  Body is medium and feel is crisp with an almost completely dry finish. This is reminding me of some other potent yet expertly crafted tributes to the hop, such as Hop Juju and Waldos'. It's very worthwhile, but don't come in looking for a jooosy frooty croosher. This is boldly old school and does not suck.","  rDev Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped 'CANNED ON DATE' of '10/18/17 08:33'. Mostly clear, just a little hazy, amber/orange body with bubbly white head which settles to thick cap, moderate lacing. Aroma of dank piney hops, hint of sweeter tropical hops, quite spicy. Taste is bitter, dank, pine and citrus hops. Sweeter at the end, and bitter again. Medium syrupy mouth feel. Totally quaffable. Numbing. Being a seasonal, this is a beer to look forward to, regardless of its high price. The 2016 brew was a disappointment, and I only bought one 4-pack. This 2017 brew is a return to form from years prior to 2016. Even though a lot of other IPA's have come to market, and the NE IPA craze has become so popular, this 2017 'Abrasive' is still a treat. Great that it is available so soon after canning. Lip smacking good. Drink fresh. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 11/12/2018 2018 Release On par with best past year releases. Aroma is a very good balance of dank citrus hops and sweet tropical hops. Distinctive smell to this beer. Taste is a great combination and balance of bitter, dank piney hops and the sweeter citrus hops. Mouth filling and dense mouth feel. Bitter, dank, dry, and sweet. Another year of producing a beer to a level to which one is accustomed. A real treat again this year. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 11/14/2019 2019 Release Quite sweet, dank, and yummy."]},{"Name":"2XIPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/57908/","Brewery":"Southern Tier Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":8.20,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev Clear gold with a white head, great retention, rings of lace Grapefruit and tangerine aroma Grapefruit and pine flavor, a bit of alcohol, long bitter finish Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation, a little hot Too much alcohol for a 8.2% beer","  rDev 12oz can with a big smudged date on the bottom  Looks like a movie beer, very slight cloudiness with a nice cap of foam that sticks around. At least it isn't riding the hazy train, I'm going off the rails with these hazy grain (IPAs). Smells like earth, pine and caramel malts. Drinks a little slick and feels higher than the 8.2% listed, but a well-balanced IPA nonetheless; read: malt forward to most. Grapefruit rind, fresh grass, fresh grass that costs $20 a gram (also known as WEED, DOOD), and also a pine tart finish  It's good but nothing worth seeking out. As far as hops, the bill here could pass as a pale ale or even a lager... I imagine they are cutting costs and hoping no one notices. Maybe some will like a pale ale that happens to be 8.2% - I think it's kinda lame","  rDev Beautiful, clear and golden body; nice slow rising carbonation; thick and billowy white head with excellent retention. Big aroma of mild caramel interspersed with spicy, pungent hoppiness; a touch of pine resin. Sweet and peppery flavor; caramel again; anise. Heavy body; chewy residual sugars; mild coarseness; semi-dry overall.  This is sample was a bit dated (bottle best by date: 05/06/21), yet it still has a fine balanced and depth going for it.

Distinct flavour of citrussy and resinous American hops, fairly dry. Light bodied for its strength. Dangerously drinkable. Oh dear, was the bottle empty already?","  rDev This is a real solid DIPA that I know I have had many times before but never reviewed, somehow. Time to remedy that I guess. This is a fairly mellow specimen in that it doesn't crush you with hops or booze, but still delivers the goods. Real nice, oily finish that adds character.","  rDev An excellent example of a double IPA. As balanced as a beer with an ABV exceeding 8% can be. There is a slight booziness here, but it's a pleasant one. There are plenty of other DIPAs that taste like boilermakers.","  rDev -amber can pour with with a slight haze and a 2 cm foam cap.

There is no notable alcohol heat. -quite good","  Canned 11/25/19 , from an Overpack'd 15pk. Wish it was a little fresher, but this is what's generally available, so fair enough. Let warm to 50F before pouring.  Deep amber-ish gold, with two-finger coarse off-white hed, that quickly dissipates to a 1/4  ring, and single-layer coverage across the whole surface. Slight spotty lacing.  Smell is typical old-school DIPA : smooth, rounded pine , dried citrus rind, with some floral and honey notes.  Taste is moderately bitter grapefruit and pine , tempered with a slightly sweet honey-on-toasted-cornbread-crust finish. A little pine and tang linger on the tongue, after finish.  Feel medium, with very fine sharp carbonation tingle late, that lingers a bit. Leaves a light syrup ycoating .   Overall, not something I'd want all of the time, but enjoyable when I do have it. Having had this numerous times, I can say with some confidence that it's more citrusy when younger , then ages to something leaning more to the piney side, as it is now. Good either way.","  rDev Pours almost clear light yellow with a thick white cap. Good retention and great lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine. Flavor is sweet up front, a touch of honey, a tad malty, some citrus and then bam here come the hops. Nice bitter finish. Feel is on the light side of medium bodied. Overall a nice beer once you get by the first sip which is a bit harsh.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) can into a custom taster pint glass; canned on 06/26/19.

Flavors definitely follow the nose, leaning more on the caramel. Solid bitterness balanced with flavors and sweetness.  M: Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. A touch boozy, actually.  O: A very drinkable and approachable, if strong, AIIPA.","  rDev 12 ounce can, canned on 5/6/19. Thanks to my friend Denis for this! Served in a DFH Spiegelau IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear gold color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stuck around a while. There's also a lot of lacing. The brew smells like citrusy (grapefruit, lemon peel) hops, pine hops and bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of an earthy and a green apple flavor. I think it tastes hoppier than it smells, with the citrusy/grapefruit flavor being strongest to me. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a moderate amount of carbonation. I liked this, certainly worth a try if you've never had it before.","  rDev Pours a deep amber with a dense one inch white head that left very nice lacing. Smells of citrus, grains and some sweet malts. Tastes of tart green apples, grapefruit, grapefruit pith, grains, balancing sweet malts, earthy notes and some oak.

Can DOB: 2/28/19 Opened on 4/17/19  Clear golden &amp; Amber color. High rising white sea foam cap. Dense and thick coverage. Nice lace.  Sweet caramel and oak malty aroma is classic 2xipa. The hops are seriously aronatic with mostly red/tropical fruitiness and musk laden herbs.  The flavor is all hop attack: bitter dry earthiness, high alpha style lupilin acids...then it's boozy, roasted caramel malt, and more dry bitterness in the finish.  A staple of the ole West Coast DIPA.","  rDev 2XIPA brewed by Southern Tier Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.20% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer glass. This brew pour has a nice deep golden amber color, with a nice thick white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, mixed with lots of earthy grains and malts. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up a ton of hop bitterness, but then it smooths out with the earthy grains and malts. There is a nice mild sweetness to this brew as well. So far this is a nice put together IPA. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. The body of 2XIPA is a solid medium. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.20% ABV in this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or a cool day. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing.

It appears to have good head retention and lacing. The aroma is surprisingly floral, but also piney and mildly citrusy. Medium-bodied and gently crisp then smooth across the palate. The flavor delivers grainy and perhaps slightly toasty malt with the aforementioned hops, some extra citrus, and a bit of an herbal side as well. It's boldly bitter, balanced, and dry in the finish. The alcohol makes it's presence known, as it should for a double IPA, especially in the lingering finish but it never presents itself directly before that. Is it a little strong, a little too much? For 8.2% ABV maybe given the strong bitterness but it's a toss up... it's certainly not  hot  and in general I think it's OK, overall it works within the whole. I'm thinking right now that it's not my favorite 2X beer from Southern Tier, but that's foolish, this review is only about this beer. So how do I like it? Is it on for the style? It's OK in my book, I've had better double IPAs, and yet it fits the style quite well. It's just missing some of those magical components that I can't describe.","  rDev I have been doing a number of brewery-oriented horizontals as a part of the ongoing eradication of The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody &amp; by some circumstance, I have a number of Southern Tier's beers to add to my list. I have been working in fits &amp; starts on this horizontal, having been sidelined by a massive head cold &amp; then by my acquisition of an SN Beer Camp Around the World 12-pack. I now make a triumphal return &amp; continue with this beer!  From the bottle:  Brewed with 4 varieties of Hops and 3 Types of Malts .  I Pop!ped the cap &amp; performed a gentle pour into the awaiting glass as is my wont, following my New Year's resolution to stop inverting my bottles. Once sufficiently decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised just under two fingers of soapy, foamy, tawny head with modest retention. Color was Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7) with NE-quality clarity, prompting a return visit from The Gelt Gang of Midas, Croesus &amp; Mammon, all of whom agreed with my assessment. Nose was grapefruit-citrusy, bitingly bitter &amp; I was ready to go. I know that AIPAs &amp; DIPAs are taking a knock for their inherent bitterness, hence the wave of tropical fruit-flavored AIPAs &amp; DIPAs, but man, I swing on the bitterness. I am a self-avowed, self-described hophead &amp; nothing sends me like bitter, lupulin-driven bitterness! Mouthfeel was medium, a bit light for the style, but I am not complaining. The bitterness of this one was eye-watering, or maybe it was tears of joy. Man, you had better really dig grapefruit &amp; I ain't just talking juice, baby! This was rind, pith, juice, seeds, the whole meghillah with nothing left to go into the compost pile. Man, I was sweating like a white man asking for directions at a Black Panther meeting, dig? Was it the hops? The heat &amp; humidity? My jonesing hops monkey on my back? Some raucous combination thereof? Unknown, but man, I was starting to fly! Dig, baby? This wasn't some groovy trip like that 2X SMaSH vibe, this was tie off, jam in, unleash &amp; get it on time. If you dig this scene, you are one of us. Non-hopheads need not apply. Phew. The unrelenting nature of the grapefruit bitterness had me rocking in my chair. My eyes were as glazed as this morning's donut. Whew. I think that I may have been on the nod. Where has the time gone? Where has all of that beer gone? The glass is now half-empty with no memory of its consumption. My sinuses are wide open, though, &amp; it kind of hurts to breathe. Maybe I'll stop for a while. Breathing, I mean. 9 out of 10 doctors agree that not breathing is not good, but that is why I go to #10. Dr. Scripts, as I like to call him, is my kind of sawbones. He doesn't ask too many of the wrong Qs &amp; just enough of the right ones to write me a script &amp; get me right. Right? Finish left me finished. Man, that was dry. Dry as the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara, dig? Man, we gotta take this trip again, man. What are the ChANces of your putting it in a CAN next time?  Today is MLK Day, M, 15 Jan 2018 &amp; ChANces are excellent, apparently! They not only CANned this bad boy, but they put it in a 16-fl. oz. pint cylinder! Yay! Hooray for The CANQuest (tm) as it scores CANother triumph!  From the CAN:  Why the hell not?    Why, indeed?!?  was the question that I was asking myself as I Crack!ed this bad boy open. An inverted Glug was out of the question since it was simply too much liquid to want to deal with &amp; plus, I have weaned myself off of inverted Glugs unless they are really CANpelling. I kind of sat back &amp; allowed it to do its thing after I had it deCANted into the awaiting glass as it formed a cap of dense, foamy, French Vanilla-colored head with great retention of its own volition. Color was a gorgeous Amber (SRM = &gt; 7, &lt; 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a beautifully cool minty-pine quality along with a mild earthiness &amp; a bready maltiness. If I did not know otherwise, I would have sworn that this was another fresh-hop AIPA! Mouthfeel was full &amp; creamy &amp; I simply allowed it to roll around on my tongue. The taste remained cool, minty, pine-y and very fresh tasting. It had a flavor like fresh whole-cone hops when rolled in the palms of your hands. Very resinous, sticky and unquestionably hoppy. Mmmm. On the other hand, it was not very bitter, which is something that I have been on my high dudgeon about lately. Ah, but it is a DIPA &amp; therefore bitterness is not as much of a CANcern since an ample amount of hops must be used to CANterbalance what might otherwise be an undrinkable level of IBUs. The malts were, indeed, bready &amp; slightly sweet, but it added up to an unbeatable CANbination. The inherent ABV was well-hidden &amp; I suddenly found myself a quarter of the way through it without a thought or a backwards glance. Ooops! Finish was dry, minty, but only marginally bitter. It was fine by me, but it bears CANsideration if you really want bittering hops.   For me: CAN wins, but either one would be acceptable. I just have a CAN bias.","  rDev I had a bottle that was a month and a half old. Pours a nice amber color with a small head. Not much hops on the nose which is surprising somewhat. Some soap on the nose. Taste is not very bitter and overall balanced.","  rDev Poured into a snifter. A crystal-clear golden color with a 2-finger white head. Nice tracks in the glass. Some citrus on the nose, mainly orange and pineapple, but also prominent sweet malt and pine. The taste is big with lots of resin, pine, orange, and a clean aggressive aspirin-like bitterness on the finish. Medium-bodied.","  rDev Almost 100% transparent golden blonde color, with a stable frothy 2 finger head. Roughly 5% haze.   Conflicting aromas of both bright citrus, and then stale dry toffee malts. Sweet corn. Some almost Belgian-like spicy yeast happening here too. Like a Belgian Pale Ale.   Some pretty huge toffee malt going on here, with fresh citrus and onion. It finishes off with some pine and peppermint. A lot of sickly sweet junk going on in here too.  Feel is resinous, sticky, plummy....again with the Belgian qualities.   Overall, yeah a bit too over the top for me, but I can see how hop heads would enjoy this. Lots to ponder here from the toffee to the citrus to the peppermint.","  rDev Poured into tulip from tap, 1/2 inch cream colored head. Dark golden/amberish in the glass, crystal clear to look at. Smells of caramel and pineapple. Taste caramel sweetness on the front then the mango and pineapple show up, nice sweet finish and great mouthfeel."]},{"Name":"Tap 6: Mein Aventinus","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/72/224/","Brewery":"Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn","Style":"Bock - Weizenbock","Alcohol":8.20,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev 500ml can into a pint glass. No freshness dating that I could find.  Looks pretty good in the glass. Deep reddish amber/brown body. Small white head shrinks to a ring, only a little lacing.  Strong malty aroma with some boiled candy notes.  On tasting, quite sweet, banana and spice notes, good and malty. Abv definitely felt.  Mouth above medium, finish warming with a light layer of sweet spice.  Overall, this one was quite delicious, and went down way too easy. Drinker beware.","  rDev It's pretty funny to me how I've only had 1 Weizenbock before and now I'm jumping to the top rated one of the style. IT was absolutely intentional as I'm on my journey to reviewing the top beer of every style. When I saw Julian's in Providence had it I just had to grab a can with my lunch takeout last week. Let's see what this one's all about  Pours a murky reddish brown with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  The nose on here is just exceptional, much like a stronger and aggressive Dunkelweizen. I'm picking up on aromas of overripe banana, sweet raisin, rich toffee, brown bread, earthy wheat, clove, and doughy malt  It's equally rich in taste, with some more bite up front to keep things from getting overly sweet, which it borders on in the finish. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting banana, chewy toffee, orange rind, herbal hops, lightly spicy wheat, and light plum. The swallow brings notes of overripe banana, brown bread, lemon rind, white pepper, clove, and raisin  A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes semi dry with a lingering sweetness  I really enjoyed this beer. It's super easy drinking for the abv and just straight up delicious","  rDev Pours a cloudy, dark ruby brown color with two fingers of a dense khaki head. Aroma is banana bread with raisins, slight clove, slight caramel, peach marmalade, brown bread, tobacco.  Taste follows the nose pretty well and brings more banana bread, clove, caramel, slight vanilla (?), slight peach and apricot marmalade, ripe plum, raisin, some leather, and some tobacco. High medium body. Robust feel, yet well carbonated. Soft, slick, slightly sweet up front, dry on the finish.  I’m not entirely familiar with this style, but I do know that this is the go-to for it. I thoroughly enjoy this one.","  rDev A delicate pour reveals a cloudy brown beer with a couple of fingers of light tan head that laces not even a little bit. The nose is banana bread, some clove, stone fruit, and a smidge of caramel. Wow.  The banana bread flavor is up front on the taste, and the clove has decided to amp up its game, taking a more prominent role on the taste. The stone fruit and caramel flavors are also present, making this a true hefe Doppelbock, with all the flavors complementing each other and making this 8.2% ABV beer dangerously drinkable.  The mouthfeel is very full, yet a bit “spritzy,” that perfectly balanced hefe/Doppelbock dance these weizenbock’s work toward. This one succeeds at a world-class level, IMHO.","  rDev 500ml bottle, date stamp of 11022020 on the reverse, poured into a stemless wine glass.   The beer pours a very dark amber color, brown and copper hues with a thick bone-colored head, about a finger tall with good retention and spotted lacing. The aroma is very nice, lots of banana, clove, brown bread, a bit of alcohol, dark berries, a bit of vanilla and caramel. The flavors are good, vanilla, brown sugar and caramel leap out with a more fruit forward character than the nose while the more dominating and lingering flavor is fresh banana bread. The mouthfeel is good, coating and lively with a hearty medium body that finishes super smoothly.  Verdict: A very nice weizenbock. Flavorful, balanced, not too heavy though the 8.2% abv does come across assertively at times but at the end of the day, this is just a really fine beer.","  rDev Can reads 'L19226' (presumably canned on 8/14/19)  Pours a foggy, muddled maroon-mahogany body topped with a cascading multiple fingers of thick, creamy off-white head; excellent retention results in ¾ of a finger of creamy cap/collar and sprawling splotches of dense, webby lacing.  Aroma presents a beautiful harmony of banana and clove upfront, redolent of fresh banana bread, and accented with dark fruit esters (blackberry, raspberry); caramel is soft in the backdrop, leveled by a properly interwoven booziness.  Taste offers banana and rounded clove notes grazed with a touch of yeasty spice; an inherent brown breadiness begins to reveal itself over time alongside wheat and smoked cacao nibs, with touches of fire-roasted almond and walnut adding additional depth past the swallow.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and brings a full, airy carbonation, remaining soft and developing a vague semi-oily texture into the mid-palate; a creamy peak presents on the back of the palate into a dry, fluffy spritz through the finish; minimal booze and subtle warmth lingers.  A weizenbock of steady decadence and understated abundance, there's a casual attention to detail that keeps the profile intriguing yet approachable, rich yet never cloying; this is a beer-dessert in the most classical sense.","  rDev Great to see Aventinus in cans.  This beer is best appreciated at about 50°, perhaps a bit higher. Poured a caramel color with a 3F head in a Pilsner glass. Fruit, spice, plum aroma, stronger with warming. Light body, perhaps a bit light. Defined plum , spice, and fruit taste. Slightly more bitter than other Doppelbocks. Excellent beer! Serving temp is the key to fully appreciating the beer.","  rDev Slightly hazy reddish-brown , with light tan head, that leaves a ring &amp; tiny bit of lacing.  Smell is nutty malt, toffee, raisin, dates, and slight bit of bread crust.   Taste is raisin, toffee, a little prune, and fresh bread crust, with light pleasant bitterness, that lingers a bit.   Feel is medium, lightly oily, with some moderate, fine carbonation tingle/burn.   Overall, smooth and easy-drinking. Recommend giving it a try .","  rDev From notes 1/10/12: Pours a cloudy prune juice brown with 2+ inches of tight, beige, lasting head that unbelievably leaves little lace. Aroma of yeast, esters especially banana and pear, clove and a vinous hint. Taste is banana, clove, yeast, faint dark fruit and thin chocolate. Peppery up front with some alcohol in the finish.","  rDev Aroma of plums, raisins, sweet, slightly roasted caramel, banana, spice.  Deep brown / amber color, with a rising avalanche of bubbles, like a cola soft drink. Clear, topped by a tall off-white, thick creamy head, receding moderately toward slowly, leaving nice lacing and a bubbly domed surface. The combination of the cola color, rising bubbles, and thick, domed top almost resembles a cola float. A very nice look.  Smooth initial feel, moderate body, some carbonation dancing on the tongue.   Taste is spicy fruit, perhaps even apple (or that just may be the spicy component since it has an almost cinnamon quality), with raisins, plums and banana. Flavor is dominated by the aforementioned fruit, plums, banana, and combined with the malt body is just a bit sweet. Some very, very mild bittering in the finish, which disappears in the aftertaste. The finish is just a bit sticky.  Overall, an excellent, enjoyable beer. The complex fruit and spice flavors with the slightly sweet malts results in wonderful experience, while the somewhat sweet, rich taste and sticky finish puts this closer to the sipping category rather than the quenching category.","  rDev L: Translucent brown on the darker side of cola or tea, sizzling three finger beige head slowly fades to a thin ring. Any lace quickly slinks back to the brew.  S: Orange liquor and raisins. A touch of Coca-Cola and banana. Bread and cracker smells are hidden or non-existent.  T: A hint of booze and less orange peel on the taste. Sweet and integrated to taste less complex than the aroma.  F: Watery a bit. Malty without bitterness. Moderately high carbonation prickles the tongue.  O: Good and refreshing for the style, but the thin mouthfeel and high carbonation go as far as to detract from the taste of the beer. Slightly over-hyped IMO.","  rDev A-Pours a nice hazy dark amber color with a nice head and lacing A-Aroma has pleasant wheat and malt hints T-Taste follows the nose with a very pleasant wheat and malt flavor M-A medium bodied decently carbonated beer O-A very well balanced German Weizenbock","  rDev Poured from fridge temp into appropriate glassware. Pours a nice dark brown with nice light tan/white head. Nose is raisin, bread, candy, and toffee. Taste is amazingly smooth. Tons of apricot, raisins, sweet candy, bread, figs, spice, malts, and a bit of wheat. Wow - such a great beer!","  rDev 2019-04-02 500ml bottle served in a pint glass. Label is stamped 17.285 290817.  Pours murky brown. Small white head. Not much carbonation. Smell is rich caramel and grain, raisins, toffee.  Taste is right along with the aroma.  Mouthfeel is light on the tongue, but builds up thickness as you drink it. Unfortunately, I think what appears as murky brownness is some kind of a chalky suspension, which is noticeable on the tongue as a fine grittiness, which I don't particularly like and I doubt is intentional. I wonder if it's a product of age or what (although the label says you can cellar it) -- it was sitting still in my fridge for 48+ hours before I drank it, so if it was sediment, it should have settled out. Overall -- I'm going to discount look and feel somewhat, because I have to believe my experience is an outlier. If these were more pleasant, this would be a quite good beer.","  rDev Pours a translucent brown with two fingers of pillowy off-white foam. Head retention is world class. Aroma is doughy, toasty, nutty, biscuity malts with a hint of yeast and wheat. Flavor profile is doughy, nutty, toasty, biscuity malts with soft yeast and wheat notes. Nice smooth, roundness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy, velvety, smooth texture that really carries a lot of presence. Overall, splendid notes all around combined with a world class look at big texture presence make this drink beautifully.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a 500mL bottle.","  rDev A- pours a murky dark brown with a small creamy white head floating on top that reduces, leaving a small patch of film floating on top   S- brown bread, dried fruit, dark melts, brown sugar   T- fruity sweetness up front of banana runts candy and Belgian sugar, dark and malty flavors of brown sugar, fruit cake and molasses, finished of brown bread with some lingers of clove   M- medium body and moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a warming finish","  rDev Banana,clove,malt,yeast, and spice aroma. Taste is very similar, almost a little dry and medium body. Aroma and taste isn't overwhelming but it stands up to others in this style very well","  rDev Pours clear, dark copper (SRM 30) with dark red garnet highlights. The think almond head is creamy, but dissipates quickly to a veil in an Aventinus weizen glass.  The aroma is sweet, with cloves and malt up front. Overripe pears and bananas are followed by Juicy Fruit gum.  The flavor is sweet and closely follows the nose. A short, mild finish adds prunes and dates.  With a full body and soft, smooth texture, light carbonation conceals the alcohol.  This is a great beer. One which I have overlooked for many years. It is dangerously easy to consume. It would pair with any occasion, but tastes like Autumn in a glass.","  rDev Poured from a 1 pint .9 fl oz bottle into glass. For dating, label is stamped '17.177 310517'. Amber brown colored body, slightly cloudy. Light tan head, two fingers settles slowly to thick creamy cap. Lacing slides back into beer. Aroma of sugared caramel, dates, figs, banana, and cloves. Some wafting of alcohol. Taste is sweet caramel malt, slight wheat twang, banana, cloves. Sweet caramelized sugar and dark fruits. Biscuit and a little dark chocolate. Medium, creamy mouth feel. Medium tongue numbing. Kind of like candied dates soaked in banana and spiced liqueur, but as a liquid.","  rDev Pours a murky brown coloration with a medium, foamy head. Smell is quite boozy, dominated by caramel malt and estery banana, with just a hint of dark fruits, clove and yeast. Taste is malt-forward, with strong estery fruit notes, spice and just a hint of wheaty yeast. Caramel, bready malt, with notes of banana and red/dark fruits: redcurrant, fig, plum, and cloves/pepper. Quite a bit of boozyness present as well. Finishes with a light bitterness and stronger, sweet, fruity notes in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation. This is probably the most boozy Doppelbock I've ever had, which kinda ruins it for me despite a good complexity and rich body/mouthfeel.  I just had a chance to sample a 4 1/2-year old  Vintage Edition  bottle of this beer and I have to say that drinking it next to a fresh bottle was a fascinating experience. First off, the pour is clearer, with a much smaller head and very poor retention. Lots of floaters during final pour as well. Smell is a lot richer and maltier. Somewhat sweeter with a much more pronounced dark fruit note that almost lends this a sherry-like quality. Still a little spice coming through, but the estery yeast notes have almost completely disappeared. A little chocolate coming through as well. Taste is a lot deeper and more complex, following a similar pattern to the nose. Maltier, slightly sweeter, with much richer dark fruit notes and added notes of toffee and chocolate, while the estery yeast/banana and wheat notes are very muted, but not quite as much as in the nose. Still a good deal of spiciness coming through as well. Also feels somewhat more boozy. This definitely becomes a lot more of a sipper with age, gaining an impressive amount of richness and complexity, but really losing a lot of drinkability as well.","  rDev Pours a dark amber brown color with a big foamy head. Good head retention that leaves a creamy film as it recedes and lots of lacing. Complex and diverse array of aromas include dark fruit; prune, plum and raisin. There is also banana, as well as light clove and bubblegum. This brew is a real treat in the mouthfeel and flavor! Soft and smooth, a product of the wheat. Medium bodied and gently carbonated. Sweet flavors from the banana, caramelized malt and marmalade jam like malt texture. The yeast produces fruity eaters in the form of dark fruit; raisin, plum, prune, and grape. Light clove provides the balance. Some dryness in the finish, as well as light tartness. Towards the end, a nice bready and toasty quality comes through in the aroma and flavor, as well as a hint of chocolate. Wonderful brew and just about the best example of the style!","  rDev Cloudy, deep copper brown body. Two finger fluffy white head dissipates quickly into a thin lace. Dark fruit and caramel dominate. A toasted wheat aroma mingles with banana peel and spices. with a touch of alcohol. The taste is of deep toasted wheat, dates, a slight bitterness of weak coffee and baker's chocolate, a rounded and muted clove...all coming together like a slightly over baked Stollen. Full bodied for the style, creamy but with good carbonation, enough to keep it from being heavy.  Minor points deducted for the chunky yeast.","  rDev This is an extremely good wheat beer. I liked it very much. However, it was brewed five years ago, so I wonder if it is passed its prime. I don't know, it was still delicious.  Look: brown coca-cola like hue with a half inch off-white head  Aroma: toasted malts, yeasty dough, sweet  Taste: The flavor is moderately yeasty dough/wheat and caramel with primarily dark fruits, banana, figs, raisins, and the alcohol is not noticeable.  Feel: light to medium body, easy drinking","  rDev 2008 vintage, bottle at Brauhaus Schmitz in Philadelphia. Fancy wraps and presentation. Looks dark and heady, with a fluffy head that does not last. Spice,banana, raisin, dessert flavors... and a nice port/sherry aroma. Drinks well for a not-quite ten year old beer, but the flat mouthfeel brings it down. Interesting, but kind of boring after half a glass.","  rDev Pours a mahogany brown with inviting off white head. Aroma of caramelized bananas. There's a ton of sweet banana bread character. May be more banana than bread, may be a little more flambé. It's a touch boozy, but a really nice Doppelbock.","  rDev 4 Mayo 2017. Botella. From decervecitas. In Bavaria glass.

Hazy and mostly opaque. Pillowy off-white head dissipates leaving a thin spotty layer of foam thicker around the outer ring. Not much sticky lacing is left behind on the glass.  Smell has notes of golden wheat, peppery yeast, red wine grapes, apple, and clove.   Taste follows the nose with an overarching wheat flavor throughout the beer. Hints of red wine grapes, apple, and dark fruits are present in the flavor. The flavor is really where you get that more traditional doppelbock flavor coming through. Hops are very mild and more earthy in character - more complimentary. Tad bready on the finish.   Feel is medium bodied, yet very drinkable. Medium slightly prickly carbonation. Dry finish builds up leaving the mouth feeling pretty dry.   Overall a wonderful weizenbock - one of, if not, the best example of the style. Also, just a wonderfully crafted beer regardless of the style. A must try for any fan of good beer.","  rDev 16.9 oz. bottle  Pours rusty copper amber reddish-orange brown with a large, dense, creamy khaki colored foam head.

Tastes like apples, pear, apricot, banana, dark grapes, plum, toasted bready malts, wheat, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, chocolate, clove spice, with earthy grassy herbal pine. Feels medium bodied, thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall a really great weizenbock.","  rDev pint bottle, shared with my father-in-law who loves all things German. I've had this many times, but surprisingly never gave it an official review. A - opaque brown colored body with a foamy tan head S - caramel and bready malt, banana, yeast, clove T - doppelbock meets hefeweizen; notes of caramel, toffee, bread crust, a bit of dark fruits along with yeast, clove and banana esters, faint lemon, and earthy hops M - fuller body, very creamy and smooth, alcohol is warming but not overly strong, finishes sweet with clove and earthy hops lingering O - classic representation of the Weizenbock style.

Brewed in the style of an American Rye IPA, available as a year round release in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter glass. Served above 57 degrees Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a billowing creamy frothed head of a maple cream color over a moderately hazy deep mahogany amber body with plenty of flecked sediment ranging from opaque to black in suspension. Retention is very good and lacing is light and streaked. 4.25  (Smell) Aromas of bready, tangy rye malt and biscuity caramel syrup up front with a lesser note of herbal, spicy and piney hops secondary. Potency is medium-high. 3.75  (Taste) Dense bready rye and caramel body sweetness up front, fairly clean tasting but the viscosity is certainly there. Lesser emphasis on resinous, piney and herbal hops, somewhat faded. Fairly tasty, although I think the bottle is a bit dated. The rye flavor and character is forward and well carried through. 3.5  (Mouthfeel) Texture is moderately syrupy, medium chewy and mildly dry. Carbonation is mellow, generating a mild frothiness and a soft crispness. Body is medium+ for the style, medium+ overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to hoppy bitter, although the impact of age on this bottle in particular has the sweetness taking the front stage. Alcohol presence is mild and there are no significant off characters. 4  (Overall) I was a bit disappointed to find following this review that this bottle was a good bit past its prime, but still very promising with lots of rye flavor, texture and a solid malt body. Paired with a substantial hop flavor and bitterness, this would be no doubt be a fantastic beer. Will re-review at the next opportunity as Bear Republic is not currently distributed to Georgia and I got this on an out-of-state trip recently. Check your dates people! 3.75  Bear Republic Brewing Co.'s Hop Rod Rye Specialty Ale 3.71/5.00","  rDev Enjoyed from the 22 oa bomber in a pint glass. This sturdy ipa pours a copper brown with a firm white head that slowly dies down to a thin foam layer with fantastic lacing. Nose of heavy citrus hops, grapefruit, orange zest, lavish caramel malts, and spicy rye. Flavors are a full on hop and rye assault on all sides with caramel malts sweetening out the spice of the rye and the bitterness of the from the hops to culminate in a symposium of a bitter sweet monster. Bitter hop and spicy rye is calmed by thick caramel flavors on the aftertaste giving balance to this fine ale that finishes wet and bitter. Creamy mouth feel and moderate carbonation makes it highly drinkable with alcohol warmth coming in on the back, especially as it warms.   I am no hop head by any means, but this is most excellent and highly quaffable!  Cheers!","  rDev I'm in love with this great brew and need to get more ASAP! Pours a dark copper with a modest head and a small ring like lace that retains throughout. It seems that this one is unfiltered as you can see some sediment. No problem, as it does not affect it negatively. The aroma is malty sweet with hints of caramel, chocolate, syrup, toasted bread and a tiny bit of alcohol towards the end. The taste is a malt lover's dream. A firm malt backbone with toasty bread flavors and caramel. Yet, this sweetness is never at risk of being cloying. Make no mistake about it, this one is also a bit of a hop bomb. This is evident in the finish and aftertaste which is a perfect marriage of dry, bitter and sweet. There are also elements of spice coming from the rye. I like my IPAs to have a good balance between hops and malts and I'm so impressed by the perfect balance this one has achieved. What a feel! It is full bodied and chewy yet so drinkable. I just finished it and I'm sad because I wish I had more. Reminds me a lot of dogfish head IPA 90.","  rDev Bottle purchased at AJ's in Henrietta, NY. Bottled on date of 12/5/13, so it's a little bit old. Should have checked the date.  Pours a tawny amber brown, with a half inch white head, and a little bit of lacing.  Smells like caramel, rye, and a bit of pine. The hop aroma seems diminished.  At this age, this is still a somewhat decent rye ale, but it's not an IPA anymore. There's some slight hoppy pine bitterness, but it's mild. There's the spicy, grainy rye flavor I would expect, with some caramel and molasses. The malt flavor is at the forefront here, at this age, but it's not that interesting.  This one has a bready mouthfeel, with a lower amount of carbonation. It's kind of drinkable, I guess?  I'm disappointed. If I get a newer bottle, I'll re-review this.","  rDev 12 oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours positively dark, more amber than pale ale. Massive tan head accompanies a rich aroma with a good bit of rye in it, along with secondary notes of pine forest hops. Visible sediment left in bottle. Flavor is more classic rye-ale meets West coast IPA. Quite delicious."]},{"Name":"Abbey Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/42/142/","Brewery":"Brewery Ommegang","Style":"Dubbel","Alcohol":8.20,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev Pours a muddy copper with just over a finger of head.

ABV was 8.5%. Beautiful copper to ruby colour, decent head. Intense oaky, malty and vinous aroma and flavour. Good beer.","  rDev L: 12oz bottle into a tall, straight-sided glass. Three fingers of dense light-brown foam atop a clear ruby-brown body. Strong retention but only light lacing. Very nice.  S: Good balance of bready malt (pumpernickel?) and fruit. Complex fruitiness, with hints of cherry, red grape, and plum. Some distant peppery spice. Restrained and interesting.  T: Follows the nose, but with more intensity: sweet malt up front, with rich fruit and spice toward the back end. Grape, fig, and some nice nuttiness as well. Dry, yeasty finish with just a bit of warming alcohol. Delicious and nuanced.  F: Medium-bodied and hugely effervescent. Suits the style.  O: Delicious beer, and by far the most authentically Belgian-tasting American version of the style I've ever tried. I'd take this over Chimay Red 10 times out of 10. If it has a flaw, it's that it's a bit boozy for the style, but that's to be expected with its 8.2% ABV. Beer of Fame tick 177/250. Cheers!","  rDev The second Dubbel and moving to an American version of the beer with Brewery Ommegang Abbey Ale.  Let’s dig in!  This beer is similar in color to the Westmalle with dark and light brown throughout, but I find it’s a slightly lighter colored beer with some reddish hues as well. The color of the head is less so beige and more off white. It is opaque and there is no visible carbonation. The head leaves some lacing on the glass and settles to a thin layer across the top with a thick ring around the edge of the goblet. The carbonation rises much faster with this one.   The aroma on this beer is more muted than the Westmalle. There is definitely some sweetness to the beer, but it’s different. The orange citrus comes through and the dried fruit aromas are white raisin and fresh apricot as opposed to dark raisins and dried apricots. Nothing screams licorice but the aroma seems more spicy to me with some cinnamon. It’s also very earthy, with some black tea like the Westmalle.   The flavor is less complex than the Westmalle, and my initial impression is that I thoroughly enjoy the Belgian-made beer more. Some dry, sweet bready notes that fall off pretty quickly, but it’s a less fully flavored beer. Limited malt sweetness / complexity to the beer as noted in the Westmalle. The finish is also semi/dry, but I’m not getting any bitterness here, making for a more one dimensional drinking experience. Some woody notes that actually remind me a bit of oak/vanilla notes from bourbon  The feel is very nice. Soft carbonation.   This is a very good beer. None of the orange, licorice, or spice jump off the page. This is a good thing. These additions manifest themselves subtly. They never detract from the beer, and create a unique flavor profile. For me, the malt profile of this beer, and the beer overall, is just not as complex as the Westmalle. While I think this one is very good with no problems, I prefer the other.","  rDev Chocolate color with a 1F head in an Orval Trappist glass. Wonderful spice and cherry. Relatively smooth MF. Deep spice, cherry, and some chocolate in the taste. Moderate hoppy finish. For some reason, I haven’t tasted this beer. It’s excellent and one of the better Dubbels.","  rDev Best I've had for style","  rDev Amazingly, don’t think I had tried this before. Too bad.  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Clear dark reddish brown with a nice head and lacing..  This beer opens up with a bit of warming. Pleasant fruity smell and taste. Dark fruit notes with some warm spices. Almost like a quad in its flavor. Nice beer.","  rDev Look - super hazy dark Amber color and good foam Smell - dark cherry and dates, little brown sugar or mollassis Taste - sweet dark fruit date and mollassis Feel - full body medium carb Overall - really good","  rDev From notes 9/20/13: Pours a dark, murky, deep amber producing 2 fingers of moderately lasting tan, frothy head which recedes to nice sticky lacing. Aroma is dark bread, dark fruits, molasses and floral hope tones. Taste is same with strong Belgian yeast and coriander notes with hints of anise, cherry and cloves. Finishes very peppery/spicy with a molasses, yeast, coriander aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-heavy carbonation, creamy with a spicy bite.","  rDev Look: It pours dark amber with reddish hues. It has excellent head retention with a light brown head that is tinged in red.   Smell: It has strong caramel aromas with raisins and plums. The fruity smells because stronger as the beer warms a bit. There is some sugary sweetness to it. There is a very low level of chocolate in the nose.   Taste: It is rather sweet to start with featuring sugar, plums and raisins. The is a combination of caramel and toffee in the malts with a slight bit of honey in the background. There is a hint of chocolate.   Feel: It has a moderate body with a surprisingly semi dry finish. It has very smooth alcohol warming.   Overall, a great combination of malts and fruity esters to produce a great dubbel.","  rDev A: crystal clear; dark amber, but beet red if held to the light; 1 finger big bubbled tan head that receded to a wispy cap; no lacing;  S: pancake batter first, then cough syrup;  T: rich and complex; mostly malt; dried fruit; mold bitterness on the finish;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish; alcohol is warming, but appropriate;  O: the cough syrup aspect of the aroma was not especially inviting, but the flavor was very enjoyable;","  rDev This was one of those brews that simply was a pleasure from beginning to end...  A copperish colored brew with a hazy look and a weak tan foam to top it off. The smell was nice blend of yeast, bread, and even a touch of cinnamon...maybe. Anyway, I found this to be very smooth, slightly creamy though carbonated as it was. The taste had hints of caramel, and just enough maltiness to balance out the flavor. For being a boozy beer it doesn't have the overwhelming taste of alcohol that some of the other brews in this category put out. This makes the beer well blended and outstanding in my book.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb June 2020 poured into a Ommegang signature glass at fridge temp 8.2% ABV. The beer pours slightly hazy light brown with khaki head. Very little retention and no lacing. The aroma is typical dried fruit (raisin etc) along with sweet bread. The taste is barely tart &amp; semisweet fruit at first settling into a dark bready yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, well carbonated with a prickly feel (would most likely smooth out as it approaches it bb date). The finish is semisweet, but not in an objectionable way, offset by the tartness and carbonation. Overall, very good.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information. Retasted 06/07/2020, from a bottle produced 12/12/2019 and best by 12/12/2021. A: Pours a hazy, coppery red color with strong effervescence and clearing leading to an enormous (2 - 3 finger), tan head. Good retention and modest, broad, largely parameniscal lacing. S: Spicy and peppery with aromas of molasses, cherrywood, licorice, and cocoa. T: Semisweet. Tastes similar to nose with licorice and clove/coriander evident early. Complex with the relatively muted sweetness up front, more molasses, toffee, cherry, and raisin at the finish. Bitterness in the background throughout, thus feels nicely balanced. M: Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. Orange more evident as juiciness in the mouthfeel. Actually finishes rather clean. O: A well composed, flavorful, and joyful example of the Dubbel style. Wouldn't hesitate to have it again (and again). This is a celebratory brew.","  rDev Reddish brown color. An aroma that's full of so many different things. Raisins,dried fruit,spice and a little bit of yeast and even more but hard to determine. A lot of carbonation and felt heavy and effervescent.

The mouthfeel is a little thin, but it's carbonation is light and pleasant. Overall, this is an outstanding Belgian dubbel and is affordable. I would definitely recommend it.","  rDev Clear, dark amber color with tan head. Aroma has sugar and dried fruits, mostly raisins.

Taste: Belgian-style yeast fruity esters, toasted malt, a hint of raisin, some phenol, herbal hops. The finish is complex, with herbal/fruity/floral/bitter all mixed in. Just a hint of something metallic as well at the finish.   Mouthfeel: Nice thickness with a good carbonation. A bit sticky on the teeth.  Overall / Drinkability: A very nice Dubbel. We finished off the bottle easily and it went very well with Turkey-based Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and spicy sweet potatoes. A very complex beer in flavor and something I'll have to pick up again.","  rDev I bought a bottle of the Abbey Ale from my local Meijer. It poured a rich amber with a thick white head. The scent was slightly floral with dark fruit presence. The taste is clean and well balanced. I did not get much of the anise or cumin as the bottle labeled suggested. However, dark fruit was present. I was a little disappointed with the mouthfeel as it was lighter than expected in the body but had nice carbonation. Overall the beer is good, but I would like to have a bit heavier mouthfeel.","  rDev Oh wow. I think these reviews may be right.   Starting off, I pour a murky prune juice colored body with accents of kidney bean and brick reds. Opacity is 90% and I'd rate the SRM right at about shade #31. The head is butter colored and very rocky, receding slowly to make sure you get a gander at its excellence.   The aroma is Belgian alright - with yeast and musty barley, trailing with sharp oranges, dark plums, prune, and coriander.   I honestly have to say, this reminds me of a Barleywine - and a knockout one at that. Even so, it still retains Dubbel characteristics, (and I'm naming these off as I taste them) with roast malt, bubblegum, yeast, honey, burnt grain, valencia orange, blood orange, peanut, plum, and finally a total alcohol assault sting.   Flavor is thick and juicy, and smacks you right in the face. It still has some polite creaminess but an aggressive carbonation keeps you on your toes. It dries out completely with an alcoholic finish.   Overall, this is another fantastic beer from Ommegang. I'd say it's the Barleywine of Dubbels...and that's not a bad thing. It will knock you down.  Edit: a year on this baby turns it into a well aged bourbon scotch Ale thing."]},{"Name":"Guinness Extra Stout (Original)","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/209/650/","Brewery":"Guinness Ltd.","Style":"Stout - Irish Dry","Alcohol":5.60,"Score":85.0,"Comments":["  Basically the Guinness I had as a teen/20-something before really getting into beer...

The head kind of has a pale brown color. The head is very rocky and fluffy with large and small craters over the surface. It looks fantastic in a glass. Nice sheets of lacing.  Aroma: There is a light, slightly metallic, roasty note. It has a pleasant aroma of chocolate and a hint of coffee when drawn deeply into the nose.  Taste: Up front there is a burnt sugar taste. Towards the middle there is a light hint of pine but it has more of that charcoal or carbon character. It has a bitter root taste in the finish with more carbon. It has a nice full presence of flavor.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great for the beer. It has a wonderful, strong, roasted bitterness. The body is medium.  Overall: It is a great tasting stout. The label states that this is  GUINNESS EXTRA STOUT  and that the beer is  5.6% ALC./VOL.  The beer has a lot of flavor and it is satisfying to drink. It simply looks amazing in the glass as well. The beer tastes very fresh but I have no import information that I can readily see on the bottle.

I pick up some milk chocolate in the nose as well just like standard Guinness  The taste here is really similar to the nose, big nuttiness washes over the palate with mild yeast and flavorful malt  A nice carbonation lends this an awesome feel.

The beer pours dense dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. The head recedes to fat, fluffy ring and leaves complete sticky lacing. The aroma is faint with dry unsweetened cocoa and a touch of roasted malt. The taste is bittersweet chocolate, a little roasted malt, some vague fruit and coffee. The bitterness is moderate and mixes with a touch of acidulated malt for a distinct finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish.

Smells of old, stale hops and scorched malts among a drop of caramel.   Has a very light body with a present, slightly metallic carbonation, creating a short refreshment.  Tastes of toasty malts, water, a metallic carbonation and earthy bakers chocolate. Turns a tad creamier then, with equally more burned malts and toffee adding to the noteable carbonation. Finishes with a glimpse of dried hops, a little bit of licorice and cold ashes.  Quite light with a nice toasty malt foundation to it, which doesn‘t bring too much depth to the palate.","  rDev Pours a dark brown nearly black color. The color is clear as the carbonation is surprisingly visible. A dark tan foam head retains for a couple of minutes and then dissipates into a creamy film. The nose features roasty tones, stronger and more prevalent than Guinness Draught. Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate and cocoa powder are accompanied by notes of nutty, walnut like, and toasted biscuity malts. A slight metallic aroma is somewhat distracting but fleeting.

Notes of smoothly acrid dark malts, bittersweet dark chocolate, light lemon hops twang, raw cocoa and medium coffee roast amidst a dark toasted, nutty and biscuity malt base and a very subtle note of intermittent caramel sweetness.  Full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel and moderate but bright carbonation. Medium to long toasty, acrid and bitter espresso like finish. Very easy to drink overall.

Definitely less creamy, less head and more bitter than Guinness Draught, of which I hold in high esteem, this is a good alternative and arguably more interesting.","  rDev Tall milk chocolate thick, creamy head with good retention and leaving lots of lacing above a deep, dark body (ruby through a back light). No nitro creaminess in this one, and not as gorgeous looking as the Draught, but a good looking beer nonetheless.  Aroma is dark malts, roasted coffee, a lightly sweet dark fruit aroma in there, too - perhaps vanilla as well, earthy hops.  Roasted malts with the slightly sweet vanilla with a touch of dark fruit, transitioning to a nicely bitter, dry finish and aftertaste. Roastier than the Draught version; greater contribution to the taste from the malts is to be expected with the higher ABV.  More substantial body compared with the Draught; again, higher ABV implies more malts, so no surprise. Still, the body is on the thin side.  Smooth and very enjoyable. Noticeably better than Guinness Draught - more complexity to the taste and aroma, (although I still wouldn't describe it as  complex ), better feel, just not quite as good a looker.","  rDev Black body, inky with reddish brown hues held up to the light. One and a half finger of creamy off white, yellowish head. Sticky lacing, uneven ring, wispy island. The aroma is delicate roasted malts and coffee beans. Hints of dates and prunes.

Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug.

It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish.

Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!","  rDev (9.6/12 oz nitro can, D. O. B. 10/24/19; purchased cold single at Shangy's.... poured into a fat tulip)  L: deep, dark brown, seemingly-murky liquid; fantastically-tight, tan, creamy foam...   S: horribly, pied-piper-ly, artificially, caramel-vanilla latte ice cream-scented candle smell - super, stupid potent, but rather Coffee-Mate quality (I recently reviewed a beer where the CM fakery was well-nigh suffocating; this may have usurped its ugly stranglehold)...   T: rather artificial, fake flavor renderings; coffee, creme, vanilla wafer... this ain't beer... an alcoholic (and deceptively so) Young's Double Choco Stout (or that barely-palatable Wells Sticky Toffee crud) violently-injected with vanilla Coffee Mate and pungent piney shrubs... mellow roasty, near-tannic bitterness lingering long  F: unsurprisingly satiny-smooth, quiet caress... mellow spicy booze activity, silky sedation in its finish... admittedly easy to slug (destroy), heaven forbid one has this at a bar while socializ-ising - too dangerously slammable  O: mercifully, my last review of the day (and I haven't yet weighed in on any of the 12 4 oz tasters at Weyerbacher midday)... had this years ago in a bomber (and/or on tap?!), but got mad confused review-wise as to whether or not I'd done it, eh?... insanely full-flavored - and of a quality of which I most nostalgically associate with Southern Tier... gotta 3- or 4-way share even a small can of this, good god (1620)","  rDev Poured out of a 12 oz bottle in to a pint glass, this beer pours a very dark brow, almost black color with a tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured. Head settles eventually to a pretty thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer of foam on the beer's surface with good lacing. Aromas of roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars for a bit of additional sweetness. A very decadent chocolate flavor here indeed. Has a crisp, slightly oily, also smooth and creamy, full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and slightly dry aftertaste. An excellent beer all around.  Eric","  rDev Reviewed from (very) long-standing notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador teku glass. 2013 vintage bottle, consumed 8/31/17.  A: Very dark brown, essentially opaque, with a thin tan head. A minimum of visible carbonation, but still manages a thin tan head that lasts pretty well.  S: Big vanilla, caramel, and molasses, with lactose and roasted malts. Some sweet milk chocolate. Toffee and lighter coffee. Certainly a sweet aroma, but quite appealing frankly.  T: Yankee Candle-like vanilla, big caramel and burnt toffee. Sweet lactose, milk chocolate syrup, and mild bitter coffee. Some deep roast to the malts add a moderate bitterness, though it's snowed under by all the sweet flavors here. More sweet chocolate and vanilla (again, a bit artificial) with a touch of bitter cacao and acrid burnt toffee in the hang.  M: A nice thick body for a milk stout, with a smooth mouthfeel. Low level of carbonation sensation. The alcohol is fairly obvious, though the alcohol flavors play nicely enough with the rest of the beer.  O: Nothing I’d drink particularly often, but this is a decent dessert stout. I wish the burnt caramel didn’t pull through quite as acrid and I wish the vanilla were more natural-tasting, but neither is a total deal breaker. Again, maybe one of those beers that isn’t my personal preference, but it does what the label promised fairly well. Scores given are what I think fair to style, rather than personal preference.","  rDev In review is a 6/22/12.  A - Nice dark brown pour with no lacing and no carbonation.  S - Light chocolate char and creme with a hint of caramel and black licorice.  T - Lots of brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, soft chocolate, very delicate char. Finishes balanced and well refined. Bitterness is low and comes primarily from the chocolate.  M - Big medium body that's borderline full. Viscous, lip smacking sticky, light booziness pokes through on the back end.  O - 6 years on this bottle is pretty much magic right now. Not overly sweet by any means but well blended and presents layers of flavor. Diggin' it.","  rDev Very disappointing as I’d heard strong things about this beer. But the look, aromas and taste just didn’t do it for me. Looks fairly dark brown, almost black in color but no real head or lingering lacing. Smells faintly of coffee, vanilla and mocha. The taste is overwhelmingly cream soda, though, and the sweetness is just cloying. Much more faint notes of caramel, mild coffee, milk chocolate and maybe a little nuttiness. Smooth thin mouthfeel, just too heavy and sweet to notice much creaminess or thickness. Decent carbonation. I like sweet stouts but this was just too much for me, even when paired with dessert. A shame since I really enjoy this brewery’s offerings.","  rDev Pours a dark brown color with a tan head that disappears quickly. Aromas of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla and sugar. Sweet taste of butterscotch, caramel and vanilla.","  rDev I knew this was going to be awesome as soon as I popped the cap and aromas of caramel and vanilla immediately filled the room. Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a snifter. Deep dark brown in color, with highlights of a caramel-sauce hue and a decent tan head that left some spotty lacing. This smell of this is something that I could never get tired of. As mentioned, huge aromas of caramel and vanilla dominate. These are prominent on the palate as well, with some roasty bitterness and a little sweetness lingering on the aftertaste. This didn't seem to me to be overly sweet, and certainly not cloying. In addition, there doesn't seem to be much alcohol warmth for such a big beer. Dangerously deceptive and decadent. Well done!","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.   L - Pitch black color and opaque, although when swirled in front of a light a clear mahogany can be seen where the liquid is thin. Light tan colored head is thin and wispy even on initial pour. It soon retreats to a ring around the edge and heavy lacing.  S - Deep, rich aromas very reminiscent of desserts. Vanilla, tiramisu, butterscotch, flan, a hint of cinnamon, all spring to mind when trying to unpack the sweet nose of this beer. Conventional beer smells like malt, hops and yeast are too low to make an impact on the nose. Very unusual, but delicious-smelling.  T - Sweet, alcoholic flavors jump to the fore. Tiramisu, creme brulee and flan are all good descriptors. There must be significant hops in the beer, because there is enough bitterness to prevent sweetness, but no hops flavors come through. Also,malt and yeast fail to make major impressions. There is sweetness in the finish, however, along with low alcohol, giving an impression like sipping vanilla extract.  F - Medium body. Low, tingly carbonation. Moderate hops bitterness struggles to make an impact against the dessert-like sweet flavors. There is moderate alcohol presence in the finish, but surprisingly little for a beer of 10% ABV.  O - This is an interesting, and enjoyable beer that delivers what it says on the label. It is a strong, dessert beer with lots of nice qualities and no flaws.","  rDev Damn. Dessert in a glass, balanced booze for days... L - Black as death - solid, a little transparency only towards the end of the glass (snifter). S - This is where CB shines; smells intoxicating, as in Dennis Hopper intoxicating. Put in an oxygen tank. Inhale. T - A little too sweet overall, which lessens the ability to enjoy more than a small snifter of this, but great winter beer. F - Good, balanced, not overly carbonated, stays lively. O - A December-January beer if there ever was one. Gonna have this with pumpkin pie this season!","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip.   Pours a deep brown body with a decent sized tan head that leaves good retention and lacing.  Aromas are odd... buttered popcorn and vanilla? Artificial caramel and vanilla, graham. Taste is a little better with sickeningly sweet, overly artificial vanilla cake and more odd buttered popcorn flavors.  I didn’t like this beer. Went to the drain","  rDev Pours black with a quarter inch off white head that left little lacing. Smells of vanilla, sweet cream, light coffee and some roasted malts. Taste is way too artificially sweet. Flavors of vanilla, sweet cream, cocoa, coffee and lightly roasted malts. Light to medium bodied, I expected a much fuller body, light carbonation, lingering sweetness on the finish. Overall a disappointment.","  rDev DATE: February 17, 2018... OCCASION: a long, strange, happy day that began with the end of Will's eleventh birthday sleepover, an intense snow storm, and a nice dinner with friends for a good cause... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... alright, another Blackwater offering! pours its ominous pitch-black body and a resilient, thick, off-white three-fingered head that laces with a ring of clustered bubbles... first whiff evokes eggnog, shortbread cookie, vanilla bean, lactic aromas, and the suggestion of light coffee bean... sips at a medium-bodied mouthfeel, textured and slightly warming... a long, lingering finish tells its 10% ABV--though flat at the middle--and bolstering in its presence... big vanilla and smooth milk make this an eggnog kind of dessertif, worthy of small, chewed sips... the malts are toasted enough to suggest the flame that accompanies the creme brulee itself, while supplying a thickening measure... sweet but not off-putting, tempered in its approach, with its late life suggesting cinnamon and cardamon... the coffee liquor reminds me of the coffee brandy I tried to impress my college roommates by drinking... butterscotch is the lingering memory--a smell that haunts my turning-twenty-one self to this day, but is welcome in the profile of this beer... this is probably my least favorite Blackwater offering--not a slam--as it weds flavors that I am not personally inclined to... still, quite a profile for an ABV this stiff, and fresh from the grunt... solid, not spectacular, but at nine and change for 32 oz., more than worth the money...","  rDev ** 03/11/15  Aroma. Sweet vanilla, very warm.  Appearance: thick looking, syrupy motor oil black with a small off white head.  Taste: syrupy sweet. Ashy aftertaste. Vanilla and toasted malt are evident, but sweetness tastes artificial/added, unfortunately similar to the Choklat in that way.  Thick feel.   Not awful by a long stretch, but very low on my list of stouts from quality sources.","  rDev This one can be polarizing for sure. I will always defend it as being the quintessential creme brulee beer (if not an original), and one of the absolute quintessential desert beers ever made.  A: Black, almost inky, quite thick. The head is a medium brown cap that rests on top and drops down fairly significant lacing. S &amp; T: Creme. Brulee. What more do you want? Seriously, though, this is well fleshed out, as drinkers get the full sum of the parts as well as the individual flavors expected. Everyone has their opinions, but I have to scoff at those who say it's too sweet: its moderate hoppiness almost perfectly counters the sweetness. So much vanilla, with chocolate, coffee, and cream culminating in near perfection. A touch of coffee liqueur flavor hits the middle with the chocolate alternating between milk and bittersweet. A touch of toffee rests in there as well. If anything, the hops take away slightly. This beer could easily be so much sweeter, and I reject any claim that it's cloying. A true beauty. M: Thick without being a fudgy stout in the feel, this one has an extremely smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just enough balancing crispness. Milky and creamy in the feel, with a pleasurable flow to it. I would take just the slightest bit off the bite, but it's very smooth ultimately.  Haters gonna hate.","  rDev I've now had two beers I consider  dessert beers , and only one of those (this one) that actually touts itself as such, well, this is one damn good dessert beer...  Out of the glass the brew pours a practically black liquid with weak head and no lacing. The smell is truly divine - creme brulee with a nice mix of distinctive stout. The mouthfeel makes this a very accessible beer, smooth and almost creamy. Though the beer should have tasted boozy, it was far from it. In fact, it was an incredible blend of the 10% ABV with the sweetness of creme brulee. Overall, it was really good as a dessert beer - not too sweet at all, a truly perfect blend of booziness and light sweet taste.","  rDev Pours extremely dark brown and opaque with a small to medium khaki head that left only spotty lace. Nose is strong vanilla, burnt sugars/marshmellow, sweet milk coffee. Quite the dessert nose. Taste is a bit overly harsh on the vanilla. Chocolate and burnt marshmellow with an odd alternating sweetness/dryness. Overall, an interesting​ beer that pushes the adjunct limits...winning in smell but not as much on flavor.","  rDev Black liquid.   Dark khaki head; decent lace.   Werther's Original nose! Crazy!   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Werther's flavor with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Over the top, but unique. One is more than enough!","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Dark, dark, dark brown pour... nearly black. Thin white head... falls quickly but leaves spotty lacing.  S: Vanilla and sweets... dessert... smells just like creme brulee. Nailed it.  T/F: Roasted grains and burned sugars. Strong flavors of vanilla and cream... kahlua and iced cream... a little bitterness in the roast for balance. No discernible hop presence. Full in body... thick and smooth... almost creamy. Residual roast and sweetness on the tongue in the aftertaste. Warming but not boozy.  O: The very definition of a 'dessert beer' and very impressive how they've hit the aroma and flavor profile of creme brulee. Not one I'd want often, but a very well done effort.","  rDev DOB 12/08/15: this well aged bottle pours pitch black color with a beige colored 1 finger thick foamy head that was full of tiny bubbles and dissipated slowly, leaving very good spotty lacing.  Smells of vanilla extract, Kahlua, Baileys Irish Cream, vanilla beans, lactose sugar and ice cream. The sweetness is too much and cloying, with no stout qualities and too much vanilla and egg cream. Impressive how they get a beer to smell like a liqueur, but it was too over the top for my enjoyment.  Tastes like it smells with strong vanilla, Crème Brûlée, Kahlua, Baileys Irish Cream, vanilla beans, cocoa powder, lactose sugar, brown sugar and vanilla ice cream. There are some roasted stout elements, coffee grinds and espresso, but the sweetness is beyond anything I can enjoy. I give Southern Tier credit for masking the ABV and creating a beer that actually tastes like creme brulee, but this brew is not for me.  Choklat, Choklat Oranj, Mokah, Jahva and most of the Blackwater Series have been very enjoyable, but this was a sweet mess that I would not drink again.","  rDev I really enjoy scouring the shelves at the Friendly Greek Bottle Shop since I never know what I might find to drink &amp; review next! Of course, I would have preferred more CANs and fewer bottles, but c'est la guerre.  From the bottle:  Imperial Stout Brewed with Vanilla Beans &amp; Natural Flavor ;  25 [deg.] Plato[,] 2-row barley[,] dark caramel malt[,] vanilla bean[,] lactose sugar[,]Columbus &amp; horizon hops[,] natural flavor .  I Pop!ped the cap &amp; gave it an aggro pour befitting my frustration with Th' Stillers' play this evening. This raised just over a finger of foamy, deep-brown head with moderate retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was very sweet with loads of vanilla and caramel evident. Mouthfeel was medium. Phew, was this ever sweet! The caramel was the most prevalent taste, followed by vanilla and a slight smokiness and dark chocolate. Oh my. This made me feel like I was going to have a sugary overdose. It is absolutely a Sweet Stout. no question. Finish was cloyingly sweet &amp; I found myself wondering what might accompany this. I might have coffee as an accompaniment since as it warmed, it began to take on a pronounced chocolatiness along with the caramel and vanilla. I would consider this to be a dessert beer, but not one that would require an additional dessert to go with it. This was plenty on its own.","  rDev Pours a very dark brown to the point of appearing black, producing less than a finger of frothy, deep mocha, short-lived head that leaves a thin surface layer &amp; collar &amp; no lace. Aroma is vanilla, Tootsie Roll, lightly creamed coffee, caramel, roast, dark malts, toffee, alcohol booze, a hint of amaretto &amp; a faint hint of anise/licorice. Taste is Tootsie Roll, vanilla, strong &amp; earthy creamed coffee, amaretto, burnt bread, prune, fig, alcohol booze &amp; a little spice. The burnt malt &amp; caramel adds a note suggestive of maple syrup. Hop presence is best defined as an earthy bitterness in the finish &amp; aftertaste. Aftertaste is earthy, bitter, burnt malt, vanilla/chocolate/coffee &amp; boozy. Alcohol warmth is present. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with low-moderate carbonation, silky &amp; creamy, tongue coating, smooth in a deceptive sort of way due to the peppery alcohol spice &amp; grainy on the tongue in the aftertaste. Just a trifle too sweet for my taste but a great choice for an after dinner desert beer.","  rDev Southern Tier Creme Brulee, 10% ABV, 55 IBU. Pours thick and black, with a two finger tan head. Smells strongly of sweet caramel, taste is cream, sweet caramel, with a bitter finish. A bit over-carbonated, so mouthfeel is just OK. Overall a decent beer, as long as you like sweet. I might get it again, over-carbonation may have been an anomaly.","  rDev I tried this from the tap at Yogi's in Dublin, OH. It poured a nearly opaque dark with off white head that did not leave a lace. The scent had hints of vanilla extract and sweetness. The taste was a bit on and finished acidic. I haven't had creme Brule in a while but the taste to me seemed more like an alcohol induced worthers butterscotch candy. The Mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it's ok I wouldn't have it again.","  rDev Better enjoyed quite cold, as suggested; whatever  natural flavor  has been added starts to taste pretty artificial as the beer warms. When chilled, I get the vanilla and some caramelized sugars, but the predominant flavor is amaretto. Much worse if you let it get anywhere near room temperature, with some bitter and metallic compounds that surface.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours deep brown, thin tan head has great retention and coating lace. Rich nutty hazelnut and vanilla aroma. Tastes like the aroma, but the hazelnut and some char are pronounced, very sweet n caramelly. Mouthfeel is thin, but slick. Super sweet dessert brew, very nutty, odd but good overall.","  rDev Sampled at Boise’s 2014 Imperial Stout get together, over 120 bottles to choose from. Going with the flow on this rating. A bit sweet, even for a mil stout, but hits the marks for tasting like creme brulee.","  rDev Appearance: Dark, dark, dark brown. If there is a cap of any color it settled so fast I missed it.  Aroma: This smells fantastic. It does have the scent of desert but the flavorings overwhelm anything I might identify as hops or malt.   Taste: Hard to describe. It tastes like it's flavorings which are on the heavy side. Definite sweet vanilla with a sort of roasted nut flavor that reminds me of pecans. Harsh roasted malt then dominates the flavor creating a disconnect with the scent that mars the drinking experience. Don't taste alcohol though it's certainly in there, as well as hops I suppose. Not for someone seeking a traditional Imperial Stout, or any other sort of beer I know, a thing on it's own that some find off putting but I find rather interesting.  Texture: Heavy, any other word for it would be a synonym for heavy.  Overall: Named Imperial for the alcohol (10%) I suppose as well as the style though they could call it anything they want. It's so over the top style guidelines really don't apply."]},{"Name":"Harvest Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/20478/","Brewery":"Founders Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.60,"Score":94.0,"Comments":["  rDev Bottled 9/21/20  I’ve heard this one talked up a lot.

Aroma tempered notes of ripe grapefruit peel, pine, and big floral hops; a clean, earthy malt cleans the unrestrained hop profile nicely while still giving it plenty of leeway to remain a hop bomb of a bouquet.  Taste borders on pure garden, with overwhelming grassy, mossy, and herbal elements dominating, and melon and grapefruit pith taking quiet but noticed backseat; great depth to the hop profile, while a subtle malt backbone makes a difference in adding balancing to the outright hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is amazingly airy, with bittering hops more than making up for the lightness on the palate; prickly and vibrant, with the finish harmonizing aggressive bitterness with a soft body.

The flavor is heavy on the hops, but still nuanced, with just enough citrus (grapefruit) and malt backbone to balance the bitterness. This is almost a double/imperial in feel, as the boozy warmth comes through at the end.   The finish is dry and crisp, although the body, again, is very  double-IPA .

S: The aroma is bold and fresh with a complex bouquet or pine / resin, citrus, tropical fruits, and zest with a bit of sweetness to it. It takes the lead over some more crackery malts but lets them balance. T: Hops take the lead perhaps a touch more while a somewhat surprising, though light, alcoholic sting touches in the middle.

Probably arrived at the same time because the different flavors are so well combined. This brew retains it's complexity without a misstep all the way to the finish. A firm hop bitterness emerges in the aftertaste and is a refreshing invitation to another taste.  Medium-full texture with balancing carbonation.   Now, this was a good idea.

M - Soft on the palate. just a bit oily, the carbonation ushers the sweet side out, leaving a near perfect bitter bite. The linger is short and conifer based. O - A very nice offering, excellent feel, with delightful aromatics. So glad to have found it","  rDev From the back label:  BOTTLED ON 09.20.17 0901 2   Appearance: The body is brilliantly clear with a nice shade of light gold. The head looks fantastic; it's large and white with a fluffy texture. The head has great retention and it never seems to go down. It's picture perfect.  Aroma: The beer has this big aroma of what smells mostly like mango with a mix of tangerine and grapefruit. It has a very enticing aroma.  Taste: The beer has a very similar flavor to the aroma where mango seems to be the dominant flavor with some grapefruit. Added to the mix is a nice pine flavor bite and a bit of grain flavor.  Mouthfeel: It has good bitterness and carbonation with an off-dry finish. In the middle and towards the end it feels a touch thin.  Overall: It's a good beer with some excellent flavors and aromas. There isn't much to say for a beer that speaks for itself. I would recommend it and it's a good beer to pick up this time of year. I would drink it again.","  rDev Mostly clear gold with a slight haze and three fingers of yellow-tinted head that last a good while and leave heavy lacing.

A touch of pepper mixed with fresh green leaves in the aftertaste. Only mildly bitter.  Medium bodied with a creamy feel a little burst of carbonation upon swallowing.

The aroma is citrus first with caramel, pine and melon notes coming through as well. Taste is nice with pine, citrus fruits and peel, melon and a touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, creamy and still dry at the finish. There is a bit of resiny hop oil left to keep it from being completely dry, but it's never sweet or sticky.

Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee.

Aroma: It smells a bit sour like old raspberries. There is a note of old dusty paper and wood.  Taste: There is a sweet opening that tastes a lot like white sugar and caramel. There is a light lemony tartness to the beer which tastes a bit like a lemon cookie when joined with all of the sweetness.  Mouthfeel: It's a bit textured but not quite thick. It has a lighter body but with an obvious amount of residual dextrin.  Overall: It is very sweet and does not taste or feel fully attenuated.

Peppery spice is prominent on the finish with fading funk and orange character.  Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with a nice, spritzy bite, lending itself to a smooth, crisp and mostly dry finish.  Overall - Nice combination of flavors, but my issue is the strength at which they hit. Even as it warms it's a light drinker. Not much punch at all.","  This is the slowest, longest, most protracted brewery horizontal that I have EVER conducted! I am in the midst of a purge of The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody &amp; I ran across a buncha GI beers, including this one. I am moonlighting in addition to my day gig so I haven't had a lot of drinking time upon returning home, hence the lagging, NOT lollygagging.   From the Bottle:  90% Belgian Style Ale blended with 10% Belgian Style Ale aged in Wine Barrels with Orange Peels ;  Develops in the bottle over 5 years. Contains live yeast. A sediment may form. ;  Bottled on: 15Mar17 0848 ;  2017 Belgian Style Saison .   I love it when a beer presents me with a conundrum right off of the bat! I generally strive for clarity from my pours in my beers, but this style can be  poor to good though haze is not unexpected . Hmm. I decided on a compromise - my initial pour would be very slow &amp; gentle with an eye towards keeping the lees in place. My second pour would follow an in-bottle swirl to release the lees back into suspension for a waste not, want not pour. I Pop!ped the cap &amp; began the initial pour, followed by an in-glass swirl to attempt to raise some head. This trick worked wonders &amp; I wound up with just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention that left behind some decent lacing. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = &gt; 2, &lt; 4) with the NE-quality clarity that I was striving for. Nose was at one very vinous and very barnyard funky. My guess would be white wine barrels &amp; the funk was leathery &amp; sweaty, like a saddle off a freshly-ridden camel. You thought that I was going to say  horse , didn't you? We rode camels in Hurghada, Egypt &amp; man, can they work up a sweat! Thankfully, the vinousness outstripped the sweatiness in this one. Phew. Mouthfeel was light, soft, almost like a spritzer than a beer. The taste was only lightly funky, begging the question of how much of that characteristic it may have taken on over 5 years' time. On the other hand, it was quite vinous, but I also tasted a light orange citrusiness. Finish was dry, of course, but not so dry as to be unpleasant. Saisons were originally developed to be refreshing interludes for farm workers &amp; this was certainly refreshing, And now, for the latter, second pour: I had replaced the cap following the initial pour so as not to allow the beer's CO2 to simply escape. I agitated the beer in the bottle nearly constantly as I drank to ensure that I would achieve the desired effect (or die trying). Never say  die , you say? A coward dies a thousand deaths, a soldier dies but one! We must be bold in this day &amp; age of beer, never cowardly! The color turned much more hazy &amp; the nose &amp; taste became slightly more pronounced, but overall, it did not change very much. Still, every drop of it got drank with nothing going to waste.","  rDev Poured from bottle to wine glass, minimal head and lacing. Bright golden in the glass, slight chill haze.

I was a tad wary on this offering from GIBC, since Matilda, though not a bad beer it is not Sofie. I hate to write it out this way (or maybe I don't) but Sofie is nicer on the eyes, she definitely has a nicer scent (hints of lemongrass, oranges, and even some grapefruit). I found the mouthfeel to be quite spicy with the high carbonation - but definitely full-bodied. Her taste though, my goodness, was lightly sweet, citrusy, and deceptively  poundable  (as you can easily go through three or four of these without even thinking about it.) Yes, Sofie was definitely a very nice surprise.","  rDev 12oz bottled 4/14/15 poured into an Orval chalice at fridge temp 6.5% ABV. The beer pours bright straw yellow with lots of fizzy off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is magnificent once the cap was popped. White grape, hay, spicy orange, a little banana all melt together in a fruit salad. The taste is tart fruit up front giving way to Belgian yeast and that little bit of banana. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, well carbonated and absolutely bone dry after 2.5 years in the bottle. Overall, excellent. I pulled this from a mixed case that's been in my crawlspace for two years.

It's very subdued, of roasted malt and if you know it's there, just a hint of licorice. The taste is roasted malt forward and turns slightly bitter for the aftertaste. That might be the Brewer's Licorice contributing. This shouldn't be considered in the same category as the desert stouts, which bring sweetness with tastes of Creme Brule, chocolate, peanut butter, cherry pie and the like. The licorice here actually adds a little bitterness and to a dry finish.","  rDev Dark brown, with moderate very fine tan head, that leaves a fine ring and light lacing.

Well-done! :)","  rDev Re-review, since it's the original 1988 recipe and stuff (this beer is as old as me!); poured in the same damn Samuel Smith pint glass with a nearly pitch-black body. The head is khaki-colored, with good retention and streaks of sudsy lacing left on the side of the glass. The aroma yields no real surprises - it leans towards notes of roast, espresso, baker's cocoa, and licorice. A subtle hoppy quality really perks it up without overwhelming the senses. Taste-wise, there are no real surprises. While roasted malt and espresso are the primary notes, a dark chocolate undercurrent is the X-factor that makes this stout achieve Flavortown. It finishes with a faint hop kick, offering just enough to cleanse the palate. The finish also meshes beautifully with the creamy, lush texture, keeping it decently dry while still offering the softness I love in a good stout. Carbonation is fairly low. Like yours truly, this is a classic for a reason.   PS: Oh cruel irony, 8 years ago I lamented how I couldn't buy this in Maryland, meaning I had to drive to Virginia to buy it. Nowadays, I can find it in Maryland no sweat, but I'd have no such luck in Virginia ever since Bell's stopped distributing there.  ---  Original score from February 27, 2012: 4.12 (4/4.5/4/4/4)  Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass.  A: Pours a very dark brown color one expects from a stout. It's not impregnable to the light, but it works well. The head is a one finger dark cream color with good lacing, but lacking retention.  S: Very strong roast, espresso, and chocolate notes, with the licorice appearing as a secondary characteristic to the main scent. Amazingly in your face aroma.  T: The flavors are quite good, if not on the same level as the smell. There's an opening of wood and vanilla, followed by a sudden, welcome upsurge of roasted malt and chocolate. Finally, there's a combination of a vegetal component and some subtle licorice on the finish. The flavors progress smoothly and create a good balance, being neither overly sweet nor bitter, and tastes bigger than its 6% might suggest.  M: Good thickness overall, with a smooth, semi-creamy body and little dryness on the back end. Carbonation is low.  O: Definitely a great stout. It's not perfect, but it genuinely makes me wish I didn't have to drive to Virginia to get it (then again, it's worth going a state over to pick it up...)","  rDev Classic no frills American stout It’s roasty has that classic acidic coffee, light smoke dark bakers chocolate sweetness.

When held against a bright back light I can detect some copper gold tinges around the edges. Brownish tan cap with decent lacing.  Aroma of very good coffee laced with Turbinado sugar. There is a clean spiciness about it that I cannot specifically identify but reminds me of a high quality Chinese Five Spice blend.  Taste of clean roasted malt carrying along with it elements of coffee, cocoa and a touch of anise. The spice element is upfront singing solo but the bass elements are in good voice supporting the theme. Well made, consistent throughout and finishes dry.  Medium texture with balancing carbonation.  A strikingly balanced brew and whether the brewer want's to call it a Porter or a Stout doesn't matter a whit.","  rDev Pours pitch black with a webbed, tan head.

The Stout was pourd from a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer glass. There nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted goodness an a slight sweetness. You pick up on Roasted grains, malts an a licorice. So far this is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You pick up at first a lot of roasted grains an malts. Then you pick up a slight sweetness from the licorice in the taste of this brew. The licorice is a nice touch to this brew. The body of Kalamazoo Stout is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. The mouth feel is Bold, Roasted, Rich, Clean, Smooth, Licorice, and Refreshing. This brew would go nice with dinner or a cold winter day. Overall I am going to give Kalamazoo Stout a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity too.

Finishes with lingering dark chocolate and roast  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A nice stout that has good balance and drinkability","  rDev Bottled 2/19/2018 and poured from 12. oz. bottle into snifter glass. It pours nearly black with dark walnut hues and a half finger of fluffy, mocha-colored lacing that dissipated slowly as the glass warmed. Its nose features roasted malt, burnt coffee, dark chocolate, nuts, and whiffs of caramel, peat, tobacco smoke, and anise. The taste is mostly burnt and dry with burnt coffee and char, along with dry nuts, baker's chocolate, anise, and earthy peat. There's some bitter hoppiness at the finish but it's hard to distinguish from the bitterness of the burnt coffee. For a stout it has a rather thin mouth feel, with light to moderate carbonation, and its 6% ABV poses no limit on its drinkability. It drinks more like a Porter. Overall, if you like bitter, burnt stouts, then this one's for you. If you like sweet chocolate or dark fruit, then I'd suggest a different offering.","  rDev Black color beer with a fairly large tan head. Good retention. Sticky.

The hops are earthy but not penetrating.  Smooth, medium to full mouthfeel.   Sweet roasted malts and licorice play up big in the flavor too but they seem a but more subtle than the nose suggested.

Hazy golden amber with very active carbonation.  Strong aroma; I can smell it while pouring. Bready, light fruit, and spice. Sweet-ish.  The initial taste carries indistinct fruit - pear, perhaps, bread, floral, and peppery spice. A solid bitterness begins in the middle, along with some citrus, and continues into the finish and aftertaste. This is the most bitter of any tripel so far for me. The finish brings a bit of an earthy character. The level of bittering is in APA territory, which I was not expecting. In fact, the package of flavors, with the citrus, floral, and bitterness, is more APA than any of the other Belgian-style tripel ales I had. It is very tasty, but certainly different from others in the style. While the aroma seemed to promise sweetness, the finish is quite dry.  Mouth feel has a moderate body with the carbonation bubbles active on my tongue.  Overall, a tasty beer, nothing out of balance, but a bit of an outlier in the company of the other Belgian tripels. It definitely brings more from the hops (citrus and bitterness) than do the others.","  rDev 330 ml bottle poured into a goblet  A- A fairly clear golden copper with a two white head.

Aroma is some bready malts and fruity pear notes with a bit of general spiciness, never any booze notes.  First sip reveals a medium body with soft and gentle carbonation. Flavor is some bready malt, green apple and pears and a bit of sweeter spices, maybe coriander. This isnt cloying or a candy sweet beer but Im not getting any sort of bite from hops nor peppery ABV.

While I love Tripel Karmeliet, this has got to be my new favorite Tripel. The balance of malt, hops and yeast is just absolutely superb here, with some sweet caramel malt and toffee, bitter and citrussy hops, as well as fruity and spicy notes that complement each other incredibly well. I really like how prominent the hops are here, with some citrus notes and a good bitterness that prevents this from becoming too sweet against the rich caramel malt backdrop, while those fruity esters really stand out as well, with a good spiciness and great body and mouthfeel as well.","  rDev Bottle pour into a Chimay chalice- opaque orange/amber with foamy white head leaving significant lacing.

Aroma is very spice forward but in a soft and pleatsant way as opposed to harsh. Lots of clove and some cardamom. Bubblegum and some other nice fruity esters. Taste follows in that it’s definitely spice forward, but it’s a unique spiciness even when compared to other tripels. My beef with some of the not so well done tripels is that they can be a bit dense with limited drinkability but that is not the case with this one. It’s hard to explain but the spice, although very prominent, is of the lighter variety meaning less astringent bite. It lacks some of the fruity/estery/yeasty component of some of the style, not necessarily detrimentally so but it does lack the depth and complexity of my favorites.  4.25/4.25/4.25/4.25/4.25","  rDev Lightly cloudy deep gold, dense, thick white head, awesome retention and lace Fruity esters along the lines green banana and apricot, earthy, herbal hops Tastes like it smells along with a bit of spicy phenols on the finish, and a soft malt background.

Definitely a top beer anywhere.","  rDev Handsome clear amber brew with an impressive pile of foam in the tall Blanche de Chambly goblet. Hugely aromatic with the yeasty, fruity nose. Lush carbonation that melts on the tongue as you sip. While this is officially Chimay Blanche this label just says Cinq Cents below the shield logo. Tastes of dried pear and grain, with a bitterish aftertaste of dark herbs.   Smooth and the intriguing estery taste is endless. This is really a splendid beer in the grandest Belgian tradition.

T: Fruit and spice are the main players up front, with some stone fruit juiciness joining the pear from the aroma. Some malt sweetness fills out the mid-palate, and then the finish sweeps in with significant booze and warmth. Medium-length, bitter/boozy aftertaste.

Taste brings more stewed fruits, light fig, faint caramel malts, and with a herbal clove backbone; very light, but weighty through its yeasty presence with supportive fruity notes.  Mouthfeel is an excellent medium body with high levels of balanced carbonation; stays relatively crisp and dries out excellently toward the finish, giving it that bit of ‘snap’ going down; about as easy-going as you could want from an 8% tripel, with none of that booze coming through at all, as well.  This is a very pleasant, well-made Belgian tripel. Fruity, yeasty, slightly hoppy, and incredibly light in nearly every aspect.

Man these have been around, 10 years ago, these were pretty highly sought. Don't hear much these days, but that shouldn't take away from the beer's goodness. Pours a rich black with 2/3  brown head. Aroma hits the standard roasted and chocolate malt combo along with a sturdy presence of oak on it. Did not know it was both french and American, would say the American is the stronger of the two in this beer, whereas usually french is more noticeable for me. Definitely fits the  oaky  descriptor either way.   Taste has a nice touch of chocolate to it despite having no chocolate in it. The roasted malt is so pervasive that you get a coffee like component despite having no coffee. Good brewing technique and ingredients there. The oak remains pronounced, the bitterness is real, the alcohol is relatively innocuous taste wise despite almost being 10%. Solid chewy mouth feel throughout.

Simply put, off the bat this smells and tastes like a chocolate milkshake, with a finish of chocolate malted milk balls. That is only at a glancing, impatient first pass.  To delve into this more, smell develops a cedar-like oak, with fresh, aromatic and perfumey pine. My god, here I am again with another version of Yeti stating how it has such a cozy, comforting woodiness to it. Chocolate and hint of vanilla follow, then super reduced maple, to the extreme, combined with the oak to bring in a sort of peppered bacon smell.  I taste that freshly dry, nearing cedar, oak flavor, which is just so divine to be absolutely absent of bourbon. I then get rich roasted chocolate malt and a surprising abundance of piney hops. Surprising because I enjoy it, and it doesn't turn me off at all.  The feel starts with a sharp tang, and a moderate to surprisingly thin body at times. Nice and crisp with a swish, a little fizz, finishing semi-dry.","  rDev Bottled Sept 2014. Pours a pitch black color with a finger width brown foamy head. Retention is mild. Lacing is good.

Some dark chocolate and light alcohol in there as well  T: Follows the nose. Roasted malts and oak start things off, quickly followed by the anise and dark fruits. Bitterness rolls in with the dark chocolate. Finishes with lingering roast, oak, and anise  M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation  O: The oak chips add a nice dimension to the already great base stout. The oak rounds out the bitterness slightly and just gives it another edge.

There's a half inch of tightly knit creamy brown head resting on top. Heavy lacing. Aroma is a blend of dark bitter roasted barley that has been smoothed out a bit by the woodsy oak notes. I taste a nice balance of bitter dark roasted barley, earthy oak, plum, alcohol, and piney hops. The mouth is chewy, viscous, and lightly oily.","  rDev Appearance. Body : I don't think this could start off any better. A jet black motor oil black with no transparency.  Head : Again, I don't think it could improve. A dark brown head that rivals the BODY of some brown ales. Tall, magnificent, structured. Solid 5.  Smell. Initial : I'm reminded of a bag of licorice snaps, and dark bourbon whiskey in a styrofoam cup.  With Agitation : Lifting a bit of the coffee and chocolate here, as well as a very strong whiff of metallic plum.   Taste. Out Front : I get TONS of roast malt. Like a Schwarzbier. It turns metalic and almost citrus-like; but.. In back : This is where it gets interesting. Buzzing chocolate, tons of prune, and a bit of blueberry/oak.   Feel. Pretty creamy actually. A stout carbonation underneath props it up some to help it buzz down the throat.   Overall : The Oak Aged Yeti was a touch disappointing in the taste department, as it lead up to something so potentially divine. Unfortunately the metallic flavors overwhelm the palate, especially as it warms, and I don't taste enough chocolate, fruits/sweetness, or burn of the bourbon. Still a decent beer, just not the knockout I was thinking.","  rDev 32oz growler filled at Heinen's in University Hts., Ohio  Growler poured into a tulip. Pours black basically with a nice mocha head that fades leaving nice retention and nice lacing. The aromas are full of cocoa malts. Hints of chocolate and vanilla. The aromas seem ultimately subtle and not overwhelming. The flavors are very bold and rich. Nice bitterness, just like most Yeti variants. Lots of dark chocolate. Lots of anise/black licorice notes as well. Roasted malts are there. Very subtle citrus notes, believe it or not. The oak chips are present in the flavor department giving it a nice  harshness . Alcohol basically goes completely unnoticed. Mouthfeel is nice. It's full-bodied with active carbonation. It's not thick, but not thin. Smooth and creamy. It's easy to drink, but makes for a nice sipper. Dangerously drinkable.  This is a nice stout right here. It might not be my personal favorite Yeti variant, but it's still very enjoyable and well crafted stuff. Not bad at all, I like it and it's fun to drink.

Head so aggressive it makes the pour difficult. Aroma is Hershey's chocolate syrup, toffee, oak-wood vanilla, dark roasted/burned malts &amp; some coffee.

Wookey Jack  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle,  BOTTLED ON: 01/05/16  so a year and 5 months old $3.99 @ Total Wine &amp; More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness; A friend of mine introduced me to Wookey Jack about a year ago. He had a 6-pack at one of his parties and I ended up drinking almost the whole thing. It immediately became one of my favorite beers. I love that it's hoppy, but not so much so that the malt can't compete, and that the rye shows clearly; and looking at what I've got in front of me, given that it's well over a year old, it's surprisingly hoppy - I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. Anyway, I'm not sure when this was discontinued but I haven't been able to find it - I'm sure there are fresher bottles around, in fact this one from Total Wine &amp; More was probably bottled before the ones that I got from my friend! I bought it anyway, despite the price, because I like it that much; and to be honest, upon tasting it now the malt has held up extremely nicely as well. There's a touch of oxidation there, sure, but it's not bad, I'm still enjoying it. All of the dark chocolate is there, the softer fudge-like and caramel notes, the roastiness, the spice from the rye, and the pine and citrus from the hops - and if there's one thing that's missing it's that the citrus seems to have waned a little. Oh man, I'm going to miss this one. Hopefully I'll come across some that's been discounted and I can buy up the lot. I said before that if the new Leo v. Ursus beers were all as good as the Forte it would be worth it to discontinue some others, but sitting here with one in my hand I doubt that. This is the best black rye IPA that I've ever tasted, and probably one of my top 10 favorites - or at least one of my top 10 favorite dark beers, that's definite. A moment of silence. ... ... ... Wookey Jack, you will be missed.","  rDev Poured from a standard 12oz into a short stem tulip glass. 8.2% ABV.  Look: Awesome jet black color, almost no head of foam, trace amounts of lacing. Smell: Roasted malts, sweet chocolate, hints of coffee. Very subtle pine as it warms. Taste: Much more hop forward. Bitter, piney, much more coffee. Even malt character that gives it a necessary balance. Really nice profile. Feel: Low but sharp levels of carbonation, smooth but sticky. Pretty light body.  Great beer overall. Incredible aromas balanced by a hop forward , malt balanced Rhye IPA. Exactly what you'd want and expect from the style.","  rDev Bottle poured into a Firestone Walker Brewing Co pint glass  A: Pours nearly black, with a frothy light brown head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some nice lacing.   S: Roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, a hint of smoke, pine, spruce, citrus, a little tropical fruit, and a touch of toffee sweetness.  T: It might be dark as night but the hops jump right to the front with pine, citrus, orange, grapefruit, and lemon, tropical fruit, pineapple, passion fruit, and peach, backed with roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, a faint hint smoke, spicy rye, earthy herbal notes, and a little toffee sweetness.  M: Medium to full body, just the right carbonation bite before going down silky smooth.   O: It's an absolute shame this beer is going away.

I don't get much in the way of roast, and while black IPA's don't have a ton of it, my favorite examples have more roast than this. Closing your eyes, you can't tell it's a black IPA.

Pleasant combination of malts and hops give this black IPA a hallowed showcase to it's name. Despite the mix, seemingly well-balanced.

Head dissipates but leaves lots of sticky lacing and a tun mocha colored film on top of the beer. The film sticks around until the end of the beer with sticky lacing the whole way down.  Smell is an interesting aroma of rye malts, toasted rye bread, bitter grass, pineapple and an earthy wood aroma. A touch of chocolate and spice is also noted in the aroma.   Taste is initially very strong on the rye and pumpernickel bread flavors. It seriously tastes like liquid rye bread. There is a strong bitterness from the hops that is earthy, woody and grassy. Some chocolate notes are there with a dry cocoa like character towards the back end of the flavor. The cocoa like notes with the very bitter hoppiness makes for a dry finish. The beer is surprisingly bitter up front but the lingering aftertaste is a dry sweet chocolatey one that is really nice. Very interesting flavor progression on the tongue.   Feel is medium carbonation, with a nice smooth feel on the beer. The weight is close to a DIPA but given the whole package it feels appropriate. Nice dry resinous finish.

Problem is, the majority of the time you find it, its not fresh, so I have to pass.","  rDev Picked up while in NV. Looks as it should - black body and off-white head with some stamina and lacing. A mix of fruity hop aroma and a dark to not quite roast malt aroma. Reasonable fresh. A good mix of flavors. At times the hops are fruity and interesting. The dark malts offer a nice background with no heavy roast but a touch of sweetness at times. Mild and smooth bitterness and short finish for a hoppy beer.  My biggest complaint is the higher than expected, and I would say, normal carbonation. At times it feels like a Belgian ale in my mouth with all sorts of gas and little body. Too much. When is settled down some is feels closer to moderate. Nice mix of flavors, but a problem with the carbonation.","  rDev Poured into a chalice: color is black, solid; head is tan and dense about 1/2 inch thick with some moderate lacing and lingers well.  Smell is a nice balance of roast malt and strong fresh hop bitterness; subtle toast in the malt flavor with grassy earthy notes from hops.  Taste is similar to the aroma: great malt roastiness with very fresh hop bitterness; malt is roast, light coffee/espresso, hops are earthy, grassy, floral.  Mouthfeel is excellent for this style: great interplay between malt strength and hop bitterness, a bit highly carbonated but works.

Pours black as a starless night with dark ruby edges. World class head volume, lacing and retention.  World class nose of rich citrus (tangerine, pineapple, orange) over a slightly sweet malt base with a strong caramel note and a subtle rye spiciness. Underneath the fruity esters a dark malt presence lurks, but never makes it to the forefront.  Light medium body with a rich smoothness that is slightly oily at times and has a bit of creaminess in the finish. World class carbonation with a strong effervescent middle and a roiling finely bubbled prickly finish.  The flavor profile is outstanding, but falls short of world class due to the failure to completely cover the alcohol. Slightly sweet fruits lead and flow into a caramel based sweetness prior to the middle. The middle brings a moderate bitterness that is rind in nature (orange, not grapefruit). Dark malts arrive with more of a char rather than roast character along with a mild rye flavor and even more subtle spiciness. As the bitterness subsides, caramel makes its strongest influence and, unfortunately, so does the grain alcohol flavor and slight astringency. The finish is slightly dry and leaves a slow fade of alcohol, char, caramel and rye .","  rDev Black IPA, Hoppy Stouts and Strong Ales - these are among my favorites. Firestone delivers.

My co-worker raves about this beer. Years later, I am finally going to drink this beer ( I probably should have done this long before now). The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a one-fingered head. The creamy tan had so-so retention and left no lacing on the glass. I was hoping for some type of lacing or retention. The color of the beer is SRM 20, dark amber brown with a reddish tint. The beer is clear with some carbonation bubbles suspended mid-liquid.   I get candied cherries followed by sourness. Another whiff I smell, oak, wine, malty sweetness, toffee, raisins, and earthiness. I want to say it smells like cough syrup but not with all the nastiness that cough syrup embodies. I love the aromas of this beer it is fragrant, sweet, and sour.   A huge punch of sourness, followed by candied cherries, and oak. Next, I get sherry-like wine flavors, vanilla, malty sweetness, and raisins. I taste apples, earthiness with a touch of funky.   The mouthfeel is puckering, tart, and dry.   The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and full finish.   This beer is awesome, it has big rich flavors. Leaves your mouth watering but finishes dry.

Smell is mixed brandy-soaked dried stone fruit+ (cherry,plum,apricot,fig?) , with some acetic sourness, and a bit of tannic wetness .   Taste is light, mellow acetic sourness, dried cherry &amp; plum, with some light oaky flavor. Light drying bitterness, that lingers awhile past finish.  Feel is light, but not watery, with moderate soft carbonation.   Overall, just a joy to drink. The high regard for this beer is well-deserved. :)","  rDev This was my introduction to Flanders red ales, so long ago, and I’ll always have a fond place for it. Pours a ruddy reddish auburn. Light funk to the aroma, with lots of sour cherry. I get a nicely tart cherry note on the palate, with a crisp finish. Sweet, and perhaps sweeter than I otherwise like these days, but still solid.","  rDev These Flanders reds have been delightful, and this one is no exception - darker than some, this had a ruddy brown body - essentially opaque - but the flavor and aroma profiles are on-point with the best of the rest - full of tangy and tart cherry and berry and currant, with lighter oaky wood tannins and quenching character from the very start to the finish - really good stuff...","  rDev This is the textbook example of the Flanders Red. Beautiful dark red ruby color with long lasting foam. It’s fruity with cherries, delightfully sweet, and the tangy acidity gives it balance. It’s not sour like the American wild ale, just complex and deeply fruity. Served in the D de B globe glass at Swirl on Castro in SF.","  rDev Dark amber in color with tiny beige carbonation bubbles around part of the rim. The aroma is of horse blanket, tart sour cherries, oak, and touch of vinegar. I’m tasting light lactic sourness, dark cherries, and a faint vinegar flavor. The mouth is moderately carbonated and smooth from its time spent in oak.","  rDev Bottled and bought as a carry out under recommendation of the landlady of the Microbar Pours a very dark brown body with red hue and splatterings of tan head  Stalls like red wine vinegar  Flavour is brown sugar, Sherry and sweet pickle","  rDev Verhaeghe 'Duchesse De Bourgogne' @ 6.2% , served from a 330 ml bottle A-pour is amber from the bottle to a dirty brown in the glass with a frothy tan head leaving a spotty lace along the tulip S-beautifully pungent T-sweet candied fruit , smooth , refreshing MF-decent carbonation , feels full bodied Ov-one sip &amp; I fell in love with this beer , wow+ prost LampertLand","  rDev Poured from a 330ml battle.

Rica mezcla de frutos rojos con vino tinto, con una acidez que es muy asequible para cualquier paladar y olfato.","  rDev  Best by 6/22/17 ; drank 3/6/16 @ the Yarchives.   Murky dark purple appearance.   Nice khaki head; strong, frothy lace.   Dark cherry &amp; faint nail polish remover notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Dark cherry soda flavor up front; faint nail polish remover notes on the finish.   Very sweet with astringent booze heat; somehow drinkable but far from enjoyable.","  rDev Pours a dark brown with red highlights, a one inch fluffy and well retained beige head that let blotchy lacing. Smells of yeast, tart fruit, oak and vinegar. Interesting blend of sweet and tart fruit flavors with berries and cherries the predominant flavors, oak, Belgian yeast just a hint of vinegar, brown sugar, grapes, caramel and a cherry coke quality. Medium bodied and carbonation, slightly dry finish. Very complex sipper.","  rDev Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) brown bottle into a customer taster pint; best if consumed by 6/4/2020. A: Pours a crystal clear, dark copper color with orange-amber highlights, a two to three finger, foamy, tan-rose head, impressive retention, foamy, clumpy lacing that tends to hug the fluid meniscus well down the glass. S: Acetic acid aroma at first blush, but quickly resolves to a tart and fruity (apple, cherry, berry) melange. Maybe a little lactic acid when it settles down. T: Sweet and tart with flavors of berries (raspberry, blackberry), pinot noir, cherry, cane sugar, plum, and pomegranate. Caramel somewhere in there. Bitterness submerged to a large degree, but style evident and helping with a fairly sharp finish. M: Medium bodied with strong to medium carbonation. Very slight tannic astringency, but really adds positively to overall experience on balance. O: A sweet, vinous and fruity Flanders Red Ale. Approachable for a sour novice, but complex enough for an aficionado. Oddly vinegary nose at first, but resolved quickly into a first rate ale.","  rDev Best by 2/26/20 (presumably bottled on 2/26/18)  Pours a clear, deep brownish red with a glistening maroon complexity; an ample head of light tan foam has decent retention and leaves a thick collar alongside sporadic bits of thick, soapy lacing in its wake.  Aroma brings a deep hit of balsamic vinegar upfront, with tart fruit, oaky caramel, plenty of acidity influencing the entire bouquet going forward; funky and very unique, this aroma takes its notes and explores them with no lack of depth.  Taste smooths with a very well-balanced sweetness introduced unexpectedly; I’m now getting leather/tannins, dark cherry, red grape must, caramel, oak, underripe sugar-coated strawberries, and light raspberry tones; the sweetness hits its ceiling without really overwhelming, and balances alongside the acidity for further complexity.  Mouthfeel displays a highly robust body on the lighter side and finished with medium-high levels of carbonation; stays dry and vaguely syrupy up until the finish, where a bright bit of oaky, semi-sweet tartness bursts through; refreshing, with some really nice depth on the palate.  Potential ignorance here as this is my first Flanders red, but I can’t help but see this as a unique, complex beer by any standard, with the interplay between tart and sweet notes evolving into a true highlight. This is one to build a relationship with.","  rDev Poured from 330-cl bottle into a glass goblet. Appearance of flat Pepsi Cola, with gorgeous ruby highlights and a finger of off-white head that left some spotty lacing as it settled. Complex aromas and flavors encompassing everything from cherry cola and caramel to tart fruit and Belgian yeast. Slightly syrupy mouthfeel, with a hint of astringence and a surprisingly dry finish considering how sweet this is. Tartness / sourness is quite understated and the alcohol well hidden, making this an excellent and very approachable introduction to the style.","  rDev I expected this to be quite a bit more tart than it actually was. Pretty smooth drinking and was fairly tasty. I don't know that I would actively seek this out but I'm glad I got to try it. I have seen it on shelves for quite some time and always passed over it. Hints of sweetness here and there as opposed to being tart. This would probably be good with some dried meat and cheese.","  rDev This was unlike any beer I’ve ever had, sweet and sour all-in-one...  Right out of the bottle it had this nice very dark, rustic color. There was no head and no lacing. The smell was more danky than I prefer but it did have a sweet touch to my nose. Mouthfeel is dry, lightly carbonated as well as astringent. Then we get to the taste - a sweet mixture of cherries, a bitterness from lime or lemon and oranges to mix it all together. Very unique and I graded it as such. Overall, I found this to be something out of the ordinary, yet it wasn’t particularly spectacular.","  rDev Pours a dark burgundy-red with two fingers of khaki foam. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma is red apple, plum, biscuit, bread and oak. Lovely aroma. Flavor profile is plum, grape, red and green apple with biscuit, bread, and oak behind. It forms a lovely blend of sweetness and light sour. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a fine, velvety smoothness. Overall, a superb beer that combines a balanced flavor profile with splendid feel.  Served in a stemmed glass from the bottle.","  rDev Served in a Tulip glass from the bottle.   Appearance: Deep dark beer with a translucent feel to the body which came off slightly thin. Medium bubbles with a orange tinted head rising tenth of an inch off the body.   Smell: Sour lemon scent with a with a yeast feel to the nostrils. Fruity with hints of taet on the body.   Taste: Sweet and sour with hints of line and deep touch of yeast. Comes off a special sour and a cherry feel you will never forget.   Mouth: sticky beer. Thin body and hard to get rid of the taste. No complaints on this side.   Overall: Good brew. Took me by complete surprise. You feel a lot when drinking this. Has a sticky feel but super refreshing which makes you think it could be your true thirst quencher. Salud.","  rDev L: Hazy red color, almost no head, no lacing, no carbonation.  S: Wine, oak.  T: Wine, vinegar, oak, raisins, champagne-like, malty. Outstanding!  F: Light to medium bodied. Lots of flavor.  O: Exceptional beer. Lives up to the hype.","  rDev A- Pours a very dark opaque color with a decent head and lacing. A- Aroma has resounding fruity hints.

The liquid is similar in color to that of the dried vanilla fruit. It's a very dark brown with a modest biege head. The aroma is pleasant, of roasted malt with hints of vanilla. The tongue brings more of the taste of the second most expensive spice on the market. There is almost no glass lacing and unfortunately, that may be a sign that there isn't much body. Roasted malt and some hops add to the flavor in a positive way. This is nice, but a little more body would improve it some. The carbonation didn't outlast a reasonable time frame to consume the brew.","  rDev The vanilla is strong and you might fool someone to believe it was root beer. It lacks much head. The porter body is good and the vanilla is fine. An enjoyable brew.","  rDev A classic looking dark brown brew with a hefty tan froth. Caramel, cacao and dark fruits in the aroma.

Very dark, red-hued brown in color. Slightly sweet aroma of vanilla caramel candy. Obligatory nod to roasted malt in the flavor. But otherwise this beer is thin, fizzy, and just not that flavorful. I don't find it particularly sweet, and I don't find the vanilla all that strong. If anything I want more vanilla in a dessert beer like this.  This beer used to be legendary. And now, it's nice that I can get it in Washington, but surely AB-InBev has fouled up the recipe? This can't be the vanilla porter we used to rave about.","  rDev Not good. The vanilla flavor is overdone. Added to the roasted grain flavor it has a medicine taste. There are better flavored porters and stouts. I would avoid this one.","  rDev Attractive nose with vanilla and sweet maple tones over a broad caramel malt. Also a bit of bread crust and yeast. Not much for a head, but a pleasant walnut color, with solid clarity.   A bit of chewiness in the texture is a plus, and there are cocoa and vanilla notes. The finish is a bit unevenntful and this is not a buttkicking porter. Still, this is tasty and drinkable so you could do much worse.","  rDev 12oz bb 5/11/19 poured into a pokal glass at fridge temp 5.4% ABV. The beer pours bright light to medium brown with chestnut highlights and mocha colored head. The head recedes to a thin film and leaves some lacing. The aroma is faint with with chocolate and weak roasted malt. The taste is semisweet watery chocolate with a non-bitter barely perceptible vanilla finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, not much. This is a very generic shell of a porter. More off a watery brown ale.

Aroma is dark roasted malts: semisweet chocolate, roasted nuts, a note of char/burnt and vanilla. The vanilla is very minimal and a little disappointing. Taste is dark roasted/burnt malt, biscuit, bitter chocolate and nuts with toffee and pepper spice in the finish. Aftertaste is roast malt with a little smoke and bitterness.

Probably.   And did two winters later and appreciate it even more. BB's porter doesn't try to do too much like a lot in this style. The vanilla is subtle enough and the roasted malts are dry enough and, still, pleasant. Perhaps thin, but that is how I need to get. So, I will have BB's porter yet again... perhaps in three years hence.","  rDev Pours a medium to dark brown with a half inch tan head that was poorly retained and left a couple rings of lacing.

Reminds me of Pliny in someways.","  rDev Pours a hazed copper color with a compact, frothy cap. Simcoe fruitiness mingles with cookie dough malts in the nose. Citrusy, peach, melon hops abound in the taste. A solid, clean pale malt ballast keeps things in check. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation.

It's perfectly fine IPA, but I'm not sure what others see to make this stand that much above the rest. Also, paying a premium price for this makes it even worse.  Now, that's not saying this isn't good, it is. Pleasing mix of fruit, flower, pine and herbs in the aroma. More golden and mostly clear. Has an aqueous look to it. Smallish white head leaves in pretty short order.  Nice complexity to the flavor. Robust hop flavors, again with the mix of fruit, flowers, pine and herbs but not matching the aroma. There is also a pleasing streak of hop flavors that really lay on the tongue and delay the presentation of the bitterness, which is strong but not over the top. The mix of the two stick around for a good long time in the finish.  Appropriate feel, at moderate and a little bumped up carbonation.  I think the complexity of flavors makes this separate from others, esp, with only 2 hop types. And the mix works well.  I did buy a 6-pack and this is the third one. It is better than the first two - which were really quite average. But with this one it touches on what others rave on.","  rDev Tall 22oz long neck 22oz dated best by 28AUG17. Served in a pint glass. Beer pours medium gold brass, not quite clear, with a nice thick white head. Aroma is both piny and floral. Assertive pine sap bitterness on the tongue, with a very neutral malt backbone. Balanced and surprisingly well described on the label as a  single  IPA, when considering both the name  Duet  and the 7.0% ABV. In addition to the great balance of flavor, fine carbonation gives it a really good mouthfeel. Just a hint of oily hop resin in the aftertaste.  Well done. Could become a go-to IPA if it were more widely available here.","  rDev L: Slightly hazy, translucent orange with a tight white head. Excellent retention and lacing.  S: Orange marmalade, orange peel, grapefruit peel, pineapple, dankness, sweet biscuit malt, brown sugar, pine.   T: Tons of bittersweet orange, yellow grapefruit, orange marmalade, papaya, and pineapple. There's a sugary biscuit backbone, but it dries off nicely into a dank and piney finish with some lingering orange and grapefruit peel notes. There's also a bit of a lingering black tea flavor.  F: Medium-bodied, smooth and filling, nicely pushing carbonation for a creamy feel yet quick flow.   O: The first Alpine beer that has really impressed me. This is a very good WC IPA. Hoppy, citrusy, and piney with a dry and bitter finish.","  rDev Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, some resin.

The body is hazy orange-honey colored, with a towering head of 3 fingers, leaving TONS of good lace behind. Some hop sediment floating.   Lots of caramel and old hop aromas, so yeah this isn't starting off too great. Light pine behind that.   Flavor is better regardless of the old hop. Citrus, melon, pine. The spoiled hop does rest on the palate heavily at the end though.   Feel is thick and creamy, ever so slightly resinous. Very good here.   Overall, if I can get my hands on a fresh sample I may revise this review. I can't help but think that what I've got in my glass is totally unfair for me to diss on. I upped everything by a quarter point over my impressions to make up for it.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazed golden with a foamy head and sticky lace.   Soft nose of orange, pine and breadiness.  Light-bodied, but there's a slight chew and smoothness to the feel. Carbonation is crisp upfront. Quite hoppy, but incredibly balanced. Malt profile is bready, sort of doughy even, with a touch of sweetness, but overall very dry. Hop profile folds layers of juicy orange, ripe melon flesh, pine resin, spice and cedar on the palate. Finish is dry, herbal, ashy and lingers.  Duet is a solid example of what a West Coast IPA was over a decade ago, what's followed and how nice it is to come back to one that's not overly assertive. It's all about balance, drinkability and hop flavor.","  rDev Great amber appearance. Very pleasance fruity hoppy aroma. They did a great job of blending the fruit taste with the hoppyness of the IPA. I think they have done a very nice job.","  rDev Pours a five+ finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hop nose, flavor follows with piney hops balanced with caramel hops. $3.15 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA.","  rDev Pours a brassy and amber looking color, semi clear, and with a modest bubbly cap; it soon disapates and leaves a thin ring and lacing. Plump and juicy aroma filled with tropical fruit goodness such as pineapple, mango and passion fruit. There is also the citrus tones of grapefruit pith. Furthermore, the resiny dankness and scent of pine hops abound; lovely to whiff on. I love how it feels on the tongue and mouth in general. It's light on it's toes, crisp and clean at first. The grapefruit pith then coats the mouth with juicy goodness. Soon enough however, the palate dries and the sharp pine and dankness of the hops fill the mouth with spicy and herbal goodness and leave a bitterness that lingers and that is moderately high but not overpowering. A lovely and succulent IPA! I downed it in no time. One of the best there is!","  rDev Great balance of juicy and floral, spicy hops. It's a classic West Coast IPA, clean, dry, and light bodied. I also get a bit of melon and cracked pepper and maybe a hint of toasty malt in the aftertaste.","  rDev L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a golden yellow color and a slightly hazy consistency. There was an inch of foamy, fairly long-lasting head. Very good lacing.  S: A big, sweet aroma of tropical fruit, citrus, and lots of hops.  T: Tasted of a moderate amount of hops, some citrus (orange and lemon), a hint of malt, light tropical fruit (mango, passion fruit, pineapple), and a little bit of pine as well. An incredibly fruity flavor that's very well balanced. Hoppy, but also fruity. Quite tasty.  F: A well-carbonated beer with a smooth finish. Medium-bodied.  O: Alpine's specialty is IPAs, and Duet is an example of this. Well made and drinkable all around.","  rDev Golden yellow in color with an orange hue and a light haze. Poured with a short, bright, creamy white foam with good retention. Medium high, ripe pineapple and tropical fruit aromas with medium malt aromas and a light bready note at the end. Medium bodied with a rich, creamy feel and soft, medium light carbonation. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Medium high ripe pineapple and tropical fruit flavors up front followed by light spicy hop flavors and medium hop bitterness through the middle. Medium malty flavor beneath. Finished semi-dryly with a light bready maly flavor that quickly transitions to a mellow bitter hoppy aftertaste. Smooth, flavorful, mellow, very easy drinking ipa.","  rDev 1 PT. 6 FL. OZ. bottle Served in a tulip glass  This beer pours a brilliant golden color with three inches of fluffy, beige head that leaves a little lacing.  I get some citrus and pine aromas with some malt coming through. It smells old.  The taste is extremely bitter. It is not what I remember from having it on draft. I fear that I got duped into buying an old bottle.  Medium to light mouthfeel  The clown at the bottle shop told me they got this beer in within the last two weeks. I should have went with my gut and passed. It is an old bottle. I will revisit this one.","  rDev My first ale from Alpine and their most popular, 4300 ratings and 834 reviews. I can't add much. Had with habanero salsa. I might try their APAs.","  rDev Nice light golden color with white cap which diminishes rather quickly as does the lacing.  A clean aroma of pine, citrus and slightly earthy hops. Little malt apparent.  Flavor is hop forward but mild. Malt is present in the body but doesn't stand out, or even much make it's presence known for that matter. Hops start, follow through and finish with the pine more present in the aftertaste.  Texture is medium.  Overall a solid IPA without any major flaws that I can spot. Nothing really outstanding either, rather middle of the pack performance.","  rDev On tap: poured into a shaker pint, color is gold, head was bright white, not much lingering.  Aroma is grapefruit rind, citrus, lemon; then some lighter earthier notes, a bit subdued.   Taste comes through full, fresh and hoppy with a nice clean pale malt backbone. Hops are citrusy, grapefruit prominent. Malt is clean, not over sweet.  Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and dry, quite good.  Overall, a beer that does not present big but comes through in the finish - great flavor and presence."]},{"Name":"Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/220/48385/","Brewery":"Lagunitas Brewing Company","Style":"Strong Ale - American","Alcohol":9.60,"Score":91.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger.

There's a nice light biege head atop, but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma. There is rich body here, as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing. The initial taste is good, malty but with some hop contributions. What kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste.

Smells of some well-balanced fruity hops and malt, roasted nuttiness, and vanilla.  Tastes similarly, along with some plum, raisin, brown sugar and toffee.

Pours crystal clear coppery amber producing 2 strong fingers of beige, frothy, somewhat lasting head that recedes to a thin but clumpy surface cap and collar ring leaving behind thin lace. Aroma is cake-like bready, sweet caramel, roast, subtle raisin, pine and citrus with only a hint of alcohol. Taste is sweet caramel, sweet bready malt, fruity, dank earthy herbal and pine. Starts sweet and remains so for most of the sip with a faint peppery prickle appearing late. Bitterness also appears late in the finish. It predominates and intensifies in the aftertaste. Aftertaste is a caramel, malty, bitter pine, alcohol blend that becomes bitter, astringent and very long lasting! This stuff is SWEET especially for this brewery. Mouthfeel is moderately heavy bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and silky with an hint of oiliness. Chalkiness and an alcohol bite develop late in the aftertaste.","  rDev A nice amber red color typical of the style. Hop aroma is strong and rather excellent. Taste is yummy, hoppy and smooth. Has some fruit but can't name it. Maybe closer to figs and raisins. Goes down smooth as silk and no bitterness. Another fine brew from California. Nice job Lagunitas. Glad I grabbed a sixer of the Good Lord's elixir.","  rDev 12oz bottled 12/17/18 (25 days ago Chicago) poured into a snifter at fridge temp 9.7% ABV 66.6 IBU. The beer pours bright ruby amber in color with light khaki head. The head recedes to an island and thick ring leaving plenty of lacing. The aroma is barely sweet toffee and caramel malt. The taste is earthy, bitter, barely sweet toffee with a burnt caramel finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, very good. Uniquely Lagunitas in character. Can't name another beer like it.","  rDev Clear copper color with beige head. Aroma has resiny hop notes and spruce syrup on a toasted/caramelized malt base.

Aroma is of fruity, bright hop oils, with white bread crust. Taste is of brown bread crust, some caramel, and odd, fleshy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is high medium, and U.T.S.A. finishes medium dry.

Big malt backbone--check. In-your-face hop explosion--check. Spectacular rocky head and solid lacing--check. Well-hidden booze with a bitter hammer of a finish--check. This is a tasty American Strong, although it gets just a little sticky and boozy for the second half of the glass.","  rDev Digging into a couple of 12oz bottles of this while watching some football on a cold, blustery Fall day....  This one is a clear, medium copper color. Carbo is hardly detected within, but the topping is lovely. There you'll find a frothy, rocky layer of off-white suds, with top-shelf lacing. Aroma has a bit of toasty malts and caramel, but it is predominantly rindy citrus. Body is solidly medium, and it is quite smooth on the tongue.  Flavor also has some toasty action and subtle sweetness. Then it goes all citrussy on you. Has some grapefruit, pineapple and a smidge of tangerine, all the while being pithy, resiny and piney. And, it's quite drinkable for a 9.60% ABV brew. Well done, Lagunitas!

It's thick, sweet, and boozy, with a warm finish hinting of allspice and pine needles.  F: Medium-full bodied, rich and creamy, with a moderate carbonation. Sugary sweetness coats the mouth, but a dry bitter finish makes it dangerous.  O: A really great strong ale.

O - A powerful beer, well-integrated, with large hops and full of malts.","  rDev Another one I've downed before but apparently was too snookered to review. Pours a reddish amber with a big, wet cream white head. Plenty of dark fruit and brown sugar in the nose but it mellows as it warms, which is unusual.   Big malt flavors with a touch of spice, almost like rye. The hops drive the boat, but its fairly smooth and remarkably drinkable considering the booze factor. Finish is crazy clean as well. I am a huge fan of Lagunitas (I was excited when my sister moved onto Lagunitas Ave. in Oakland, to give you an idea), and this will not change that one iota.","  rDev Amber-red with an off-white foam.  Smell is caramel, grapefruit, rug and cat.  Taste is sharp, bitter and boozy, with grapefruit, graham, cat and pine finishing very dry.","  rDev Nice deep gold color with good cap and lacing.  Rich smell of hops. Not floral, not quite spicy, yet a hop aroma with depth. Full malt presence rides alongside the hops.  On palate the hops override the malt but not by much. On entry the hops hit first but the malt carrier quickly follows and all that lasts to the finish. Something in the way of conifer hops in the aftertaste followed by a pleasant malty sweetness.   Full body with balancing carbonation and a creamy texture.  This one is surprising. I was expecting lotsa hops and lotsa malt and got both but didn't expect how competently they would be entwined in this very well balanced brew. Drinks so well I didn't realize how much alcohol was in there until halfway down the glass. Brewer's description of an Imperial Mild isn't off base because this is one strong rich dram like a mild with a college degree. It doesn't have that smack you upside the head hit (even though 9.6 ABV) so much as a sense of  moreish  in a good way. I could drink this all day but only if staying put and somebody else is doing the cooking.","  rDev 12oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours a brilliant bronze color and is crystal clear, with a small off-white head. Mild, malty aroma. Flavor is bold and assertive, with ample hop bitterness and a pine flavor profile, matched to a heavy malt bill of medium caramel malts and cracker. Carbonation is just right. American Strong Ale describes this perfectly, rather than DIPA or American barleywine. Pretty drinkable despite being 9.6%.","  rDev It pours copper and with some floaties. A very impressive head and retention for a beer of this strength. Nice lacing as well. It smells of sweet hops. Some caramel and burnt sugar. The taste is fairly bitter at the beginning and with a strong floral aftertaste. A fairly complex brew for sure. Very enjoyable.","  rDev Another Lagunitas offering and another amazing beer they have put out...  Picked a sixer up at my local Publix and loved the long ass title to it, I was hoping I would like the beer itself, and boy did I. Poured out into a pint glass the beer has a rich but light-copper color with lighter highlights when held up for inspection. The head pours thick and foamy and the lacing is what I would call textbook - clinging to the sides, all around, as far down the glass as possible. Oh, and the white head had good staying power as well. It's light-bodied, minimally carbonated, and very silky across the tongue - a perfect combination in my book. The smell was amazing as I was assailed with a sweet smell of honey, some coriander, and grassy notes. My only nit was that the taste was mostly IPA-ish at heart (and though I am admittedly not one to reach for an IPA, I do believe I have appreciated the better ones I have had to date) and not one of the better ones I have had. Nonetheless, this is a super great beer - smooth, crisp, and the booziness you could tell from others of its kind you can't with this one - making it special and dangerous all at once.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful Amber brown color with a nice beige head and great lacing. Fragrant piney sweet smell. Nicely hoppy taste with citrus, caramel, and pine. Nicely bitter at the end.

The aroma is full of cold brew coffee, but that's it. The taste is lighter on the coffee with strong roasted malt presence. There's a hint of sweetness that never competes with the roasty bitterness, but helps balance it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. There is a prickly feel that would normally indicate high carbonation, but I believe it comes from the roasted malt. Bitterness feels bigger that the advertised 29.5 IBU. Overall, good.

Medium to medium high carbonation, good mouthfeel.","  rDev Thanks to stardusthotel83 for this 22 oz. of extra, the last beer from our swap.   The pour is black &amp; the head hangs around like something mounted for quite a while. Nose brings gentle coffee, lactose, touch of acrid air.   Cappuccino Stout - it is. Super balanced, which isn’t a compliment around here. I always thought cappuccino was supposed to be strong, &amp; while this has some roast &amp; bitter, burnt acridity, it prances closer to ‘thin’ than ‘strong’. Bit of raisin creamer, &amp; I believe someone must have said the word ‘chocolate’ while the beer was being brewed. Half the bomber is plenty.   The very definition of a mediocre beer.","  rDev Dark brown color with tan head. Aroma has sweetened milk coffee with some dark chocolate on top. Taste follows with the sweet coffee at first but gets more bitter and roasty towards the finish lingering with coffee flavor on the aftertaste. Medium to full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it's a really nice coffee stout with balanced flavors.","  rDev From the nose I didn't get as much coffee as I would expect but from the first drink I was all in. Tons of coffee flavor. Creamy feel and a lingering aftertaste that hangs around just long enough to appreciate everything working together here.","  rDev Look is a lovely dark brown that picks up some coppery tones through the light with a thick, chocolate mouse head that lingers. Smell is coffee soaked raisins. Sweet and tart and hinting at a booziness that you usually find in bourbon stouts. Taste is very bitter. Lots of coffee and a hint of chocolate and that ever present Lagunitas hoppy backbone. The raisins and bourbon in the nose don't come through hardly at all. Feel is a little thin for my taste with a stout. Very clean but not really what I look for in a stout. Has the staying power of a much lighter beer. Overall a strong showing from Lagunitas. I like their Russian Imperial a bit more as a stout but this one doesn't disappoint and really highlights the coffee flavor. Also works well with their ubiquitous hop presence. Also, though I'm drinking this one on a particularly rainy night here in norcal, a great stout for the warmer months. And probably a good choice for folks who like the drier stout style, and at 9% they aren't holding anything back. Certainly a beer any Lagunitas fan would never be disappointed by.","  rDev Pours an opaque dark brown, nearly black color with a moderate tan head. It dissapates to a steady and thin film, ringlike crown and lacing. In the nose there are aromas of coffee, cocoa, vanilla, cream, dark berries and even a hint of alcohol towards the end. These aromas certainly make their presence felt, but are not in your face. Bold yet mellow. There is a lot of good stuff going on in the mouth. It is fluffy, creamy, full bodied, yet light on its toes. What I really like about this one is that beyond the espresso, nutty, roasted and caramel malt flavor, there is a creamy coating that seems to be tinged with a minty, even menthol like coating that lighten things, adds a coolness and keeps things light, refreshing and drinkable. In the middle palate, there is a modest hops bitterness that adds a nice balance. Further still, as the drink warms, the body becomes heavier and chewy, some dark fruit flavors come out, and finally there is an alcohol spiciness that is warming. A really nice stout overall. Complex, yet drinkable and accessible. I will buy again.","  rDev Pitch black. Finger width foamy head. Mild retention and mild lacing. Big java and licorice aroma. Strong java taste with some mild chocolate at the end. Heavy bodied with mild carbonation.","  rDev Obsidian body under a creamy head of dark foam. Aromas of sweet coffee and roasted malts are backed by much of the same on the sip. Sweet, creamy coffee up front with roast afternotes of char and bittersweet chocolate. Medium sweetness, mild bitterness and roast; medium body has a nice rounded, smooth feeling. Little bit of stickiness on the finish. Sweet, creamy coffee for sure. Well-done.","  rDev Black body with a frothy brown head.  Aromas of plant and green coffee bean. Wet paper.  Flavor is decidedly coffee forward with hints of cream and cocoa, wet paper and a metallic finish. Lots of plant and wet paper as it warms.  Feel is roasty and dry, moderate carb.  Overall it's like drinking a coffee soaked newspaper.","  rDev Reviewed from notes. Poured from 22 oz. bottle into a Brooklyn Brewing tulip glass.  A: Very dark brown, more or less opaque. A finger of fluffy mocha-colored head, and fairly low visible carbonation after the initial blush fades from the pouring.  S: Black roasted coffee, dark cacao and chocolate malts, and a sweetness that makes me think there’s lactose in here.  T: Coffee and a dark milk chocolate that are nearly in balance. Creamy lactose-like sweetness, maltiness with mild roast character. Some hop bitterness towards the end with more bitter roasted coffee beans.  M: A nice thick sticky body, especially for a non-imperial stout. The alcohol is quite well-hidden. There’s low carbonation sensation, but an amount that really seems to fit this beer.  O: Is this going to blow you out of the water? No. But for a very price-accessible stout available on the shelf, it's really tasty. Easy enough to drink that I wish I could find it (or does it come in?) something other than a bomber for practical purposes.","  Pours almost black with thin khaki head and minimal lacing. Nose is quite mild toasty malt , a hint of hops, and a bit of cold coffee. Taste is much more coffee ,roasty malt and hop bitterness. Decent amount of carbonation,fairly smooth -easy drinker.

Still good, but low for me in this style.  09/18/15 Update....parallel tasting with 4 coffee stouts. Lagunitas fares pretty well and upping ratings a tad. Beats Dominion Morning Glory and Southern Tier Mokah, but loses to the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. ","  rDev First had this beer poured from 22-oz. bomber into faceted mug. This flavorful Cappuccino Stout has a huge coffee kick, which hides the big alcohol kick.","  rDev Poured into a shaker pint glass: color is black, with some brown on the edges; head is light tan with mainly fine bubbles; some head lacing down the sides of the glass.  Smell is mainly roasted malt, then hints of coffee, espresso like notes, and some fairly prominent dark chocolate/cacao like aromas; also some notable raisin/plum like scents.   Taste is similar with more espresso presence, less chocolate; malts are roasted, nearly burnt, coffee is a bit deep and dark with near burnt notes and less chocolate sweetness.  Mouthfeel is very good, seriously tastes/feels/presentslike stout mixed with iced espresso with some strong bitterness but moderate maltiness.  Overall, a very good strong/imperial stout with moderate coffee/espresso flavors and nice mouthfeel.","  rDev Equal parts dark brown and black, 3/4  tan head. Lots of coffee malt roast notes.   Taste has a hoppy edge and mouthfeel, but is counterbalanced by some smooth aspect too. Hides the alcohol well, still plenty of roast in the taste/mouthfeel department. Plenty chewy. Pretty good almost non adjunct stout? I dunno, I really didn't get a specific cappucino edge to this one, seemed like dark coffee if anything.   Could do without the bomber format but Lagunitas keeps everything in a respectable price per oz at least.","  rDev 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2015 edition.  Pours dark, near black and opaque. A half finger, quickly dissipating head with some lacing. Smell is malt, coffee, chocolate, light vanilla, espresso, cocoa. The taste follows the nose with the malt, coffee and chocolate, more vanilla than the nose, some cocoa. Smooth, fairly full bodied, a bit creamy, appropriately carbonated.  Definitely a bit of a different twist on this one. Good flavor and aroma, enjoyable to drink. Might not be a standout, but the great price point ($4-5.00) for this type of quality makes it an annual purchase.","  rDev 22oz bottle poured into a tulip  A- pours black in color with a bit of light creeping through the edges, creamy off-white head with good retention  S- espresso and vanilla cream with undertones of roasted malt and chocolate   T- sweet vanilla cream up front with fresh espresso and toasted malt, sweet chocolate with more vanilla whopping cream on the finish   M- medium body and carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish  O- great espresso notes throughout, does get a bit sweet at times","  Pours - Jet black with thick mocha colored head that I though would never go down. Good lacing.  Smell - After letting this warm about 10 minutes I noticed mild coffee notes some chocolate and a little roasted smell. The smell was a little underwhelming.

Overall = A decent stout would have liked to have had a little more smell.","  rDev Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout, 9% ABV, 29.5 IBU. Pours impenetrable black, moderate thickness, two fingers of head, nose is slight coffee, taste is strongly coffee/cappuccino with surprisingly light bitterness. I don't generally like bitter beers but it seems OK when it is coffee/cappuccino bitterness vs hop bitterness. Very cheap beer like most of their other offerings, so I would get it again.","  rDev Black pour with some clarity under dark khaki cap; thick creamy foam; heavy lacing. Roasted coffee bean nose. Flavors of iced mocha coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roast caramel malt and toffee. Smooth, silky medium mouthfeel; mocha coffee tongue coating; moderate plus carbonation. Roast malt and coffee linger - quite tasty and as advertised.","  rDev Of the 21 beers I've Had from Lagunitas, this is among the 5 that I've rated above average. This is a ridiculously bad ratio for a brewery I have the greatest respect for. (Primarily because they made their new production facility in Chicago's west-side ghetto and it has been a huge success for everyone including the industry.) The brewery's founder is also one of the great characters in an industry full of characters. (Read his book:  So, You Want To Start A Brewery? ... particularly if you are ever tempted to do so.)  But the reason I rate Lagunitas beers so low is they tend to use too many hops.  Not so with Cappuccino Stout. It is a luscious beer that does everything correctly and makes a great impression.  It Looks great: inviting with its intriguing brown head.  It Smells of coffee and chocolate so much I can't figure out if it is breakfast or dessert. It Tastes the same, but really masks its high alcohol content... like both cereal and dessert ! Wonderfully smooth. So much so that I had to save some for the tomorrow night's dessert."]},{"Name":"Imperial Biscotti Break","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24300/80291/","Brewery":"Evil Twin Brewing","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":11.50,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev -jet tap pour with a thin, tan cap of fine foam and an aroma of anisette and toasted malt.

I was intrigued when I saw it on the shelf so I said fuck it and just picked it up without much thought. I figured it was a fun, but ultimately throwaway pastry stout. It is only now that I come to review it that I realize it's actually held in pretty high regard here. Hopefully then I'll be getting something that's less gimmicky than I expected  Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dark khaki head that fades to a cap and leaves spotty lacing  This definitely has a defined sweetness in the nose, but it's hidden behind a pretty substantial roast. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy fudge, roasty espresso, creamy vanilla, earthy whiskey (weird bc it's not barrel aged), and some general nuttiness  There is also an incredible balance taste-wise between the dessert aspects and the straight up roasty stout notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting toasted almond, roasted malt, lightly acidic coffee, milk chocolate, and rich vanilla. The swallow sweetens up a bit, bringing notes of fudge, soft oak, rich vanilla, dry roasted peanut, and roasted malt  A medium full body pairs with mild tingly carbonation, resulting in a super silky beer that never feels bogged down by the abv or the sweetness. Finishes mostly dry with a sweetness that slowly fades  For a non-BA imperial stout, this had a ton of complexity. Even with what some might consider  unnecessary adjuncts , this beer impressed me quite a bit","  rDev From refrigerated can. Purchased at cask Flask Liquors, SJ L: dark w/tan head S: sweet, vanilla, chocolate, aluminum.  T: chocolate, bready, coffee, nutty, vanilla frosting donuts? Boozy.  F: moderately thick.

Purchased: March 26, 2020 Consumed: March 28, 2020 Misc.: No canned on date  This would be my second time having this, first time reviewing it. Actually brought a bomber of this to the 2019 Firestone Invitational for a bottleshare there, but never opened it and someone else (turns out it was my friend Bill) took it home. Then had a taster of it at The Mayor of Old Town in Fort Collins, Colo., in April 2019, giving it a 4.25 on Untappd and writing, “Tommy likey.” Most of the beer description is nonsense, but the front of the can read, “Imperial stout brewed with coffee and with almond and vanilla added.”  Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of khaki-tan frothy head. Could see a few bubbles creeping up along the sides of the glass. Outstanding layered lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.00)  Smelled rich dark coffee, espresso, ash tray, char wood, roasty malts, bitter dark chocolate, cacao, molasses bread, nuts and vanilla. Much of the same from the can. (Smell - 4.25)  Taste followed the nose, maybe just a tad smoother. In order got rich espresso, bitter dark coffee beans, char wood, burnt toast, roasty malts, baker’s chocolate, brownie batter, molasses bread, cacao, roasted nuts, vanilla and toasted caramel. Tasted nowhere near 11.5 pct., maybe 8.5 pct. (Taste - 4.50)  Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter finish. (Feel - 4.25)  Just an excellent coffee stout. So damn smooth and flavorful.

Aroma reeks of dark chocolate and is reminiscent of Oreo cookies or fudge brownies topped with pecans, walnuts, some coffee, roast and burnt notes with hints of raisin, dark cherries, vanilla, caramel, toffee and low level alcohol for the ABV. The complexity deepens as the brew warms. Taste is heavy to cookies and cream, sweet and bitter dark chocolate fudge with notes of roasted and burnt malts, coffee, fig, prune and molasses with minor spice in the finish that develops into a chocolatey burnt and bitter aftertaste. Again complexity deepens as the brew warms and as is usual with these higher ABV stouts, the alcohol which is subdued early in the pour, becomes more prominent and spicy with time. Mouthfeel is rich, full and heavy bodied with moderate carbonation (a little more than is normal for the style); smooth and silky with milk-like creaminess. Outstanding.","  rDev This review has been a couple of months in the making. Life has wrangled me in a hog pen and tied me to a post. It is time to go back to what makes life grand, beer. I will now get on with the review. The beer is Imperial Biscotti Break from Evil Twin. Evil Twin Brewing makes better dark beers, in my opinion. The beer is 47 degrees and served in my Madison River Brewing tulip glass. The pour of the beer produced a one finger creamy and airy medium tan head. The head's retention is fair, leaving no lacing on the glass. That is disappointing to see no retention on the beer. The beer has a higher alcohol percentage; I should observe head retention. I have drunk stouts over 11 percent with massive retention and sexy lacing on the glass. The dark brown beer is nearly black and is opaque. Overall, the appearance of the beer is above average despite the lack of head retention.   The aromas in the beer are dark chocolate, almonds, sweet bakery bread, dark roasted coffee, molasses, anise, toffee, burnt sugars, char, vanilla, a hint of phenol, earthiness, and yeast.   The flavors in the beer are caramelized sugar, cinnamon rolls (without the cinnamon), medium roasted coffee, molasses, anise, toffee, a hint of charred malts, chocolate but not dark or milk, cereal grains, vanilla, earthiness, nutty, and yeast.   The mouthfeel of the beer is luscious, thick, creamy, and chewy.   The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and a full finish.   This beer is everything you could dream for a luscious full body stout with coffee and vanilla. The balance in the beer is perfect. This beer is marvelous. I am sipping this beer to savor the flavors. The lack of head retention makes no difference in the score this beer will receive.","  rDev Batch #19 in a 1 pint can. Dark, rich and delicious looking. A tiny head. The smell is like alcoholic chocolate cake or cocoa with whiskey. The taste is smooth and chocolatey. Alcohol is well hidden. Smoothest mouthfeel for a stout I think I ever had. It's awesome. A righteous stout. Damn. Should've got two. Outstanding Eviltwin.","  rDev 16oz can. Date coding is by 'Batch #003'. Black colored body with a glimmer of garnet when back lit through the thinnest area of the glass. Multiple fingers of tan head upon pouring, which settles back to a bubbly, active cap. Leaves behind some scattered swirls of lacing.  Aroma from the glass is present but is different in that while there is dark roasted malts, there is also an earthy black licorice edge and the biscotti almond. Taste expresses dark roasted malts and a bit of char, along with the almond and vanilla. Quite dry in the finish. Medium plus mouth feel. Has a thick stout texture. Good carbonation. A very dense stout in smell and flavor. Just a touch of sweetness. Mostly dour and dry. With small plates of complimentary food flavors, this is a high ABV% stout that I could choice for an extended drinking session.","  rDev Canned spring 2016; drank 6/8/16 @ the Yarchives.   Black appearance.   A rough pour yielded a HUGE tan head (careful pouring!); a curtain of frothy lace.   Cantaloupe, milk chocolate, vanilla, mild medium roast coffee bean &amp; faint fresh earth notes in the nose.   Thick, sticky mouthfeel.   Cantaloupe, milk chocolate &amp; medium roast coffee bean flavors up front; vanilla notes on the finish. No booze heat.   Very unique (cantaloupe?!) and rich; the can seemed to help bring out more flavors in this one.","  rDev Evil Twin Brewing  Imperial Biscotti Break  16 fl. oz. can, coded  BATCH #018 20:59  $4.49 @ Total Wine &amp; More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness: Ahh, a nice midday snack, sans the actual coffee. OK, it's poured an opaque black body beneath a finger-thick head of dense dark tan foam. The aroma is a little floral and perfume-like - I can see the almond in it but it comes across as extract (and to be honest, what else would it be?). I get some roastiness as well, I guess coming from the coffee, but I don't really see it as  coffee . Moving on to the flavor, there's more coffee to it, and more almond although it still has that kind of sweetish candy and perfume-like character to it. I like this but it's not reminding me of having an espresso and a biscotti at one of my favorite little hole-in-the-walls in Italy. Maybe it's a little like an espresso with a shot of almond syrup but that's even a stretch as it just doesn't have the intensity in the coffee side. Ahhh, I walked away for a bit and it's warmed some and now when I smell it I get coffee first and almond second, so that's a change. I like it better this way, I thought I'd had it out of the fridge for long enough but I guess not. So, back to the flavor... I'm still getting more almond upfront, and some vanilla, and then the coffee - and that's not bad. Is it knocking my socks off, no, but it's OK. It's a bit sweetish but I guess that's what we're going for here, right? Could it pass as a dessert beer? Yes, I guess, but I still feel like it's coming off as a little artificial. OK, where am I? Bitterness! Yes, it's got a moderate bitterness and it balances it but something lingers in my mouth that doesn't feel right - I'm guessing it's extract although lactose can do this to me as well. I'm not sure there's any lactose involved but who knows. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp and then smooth across the tongue. The alcohol doesn't come across at all unless it's adding to the perfume-like note. In the mouth it's medium bodied but dextrinous, and quite smooth. Overall it's an interesting strong dessert beer that's probably worth taking a look at. Review# 6,507","  rDev De Mikkeller shop. En copa Teku. Compartido con Carlos. Con queso, doritos y pizza.

I dumped EMJ halfway through and this too - they're a bit much to drink; a reduction may work well...","  rDev Picked up a single from the Craft Beer Hop Stop 6-21-18 for $4.25. Batch 016, no date.  Beer poured black with a very nice tan head that is leaving some lacing behind.  Nose has hints of chocolate and vanilla along with modestly roasted malts.  Taste is really well balanced with light hints of chocolate, vanilla, and almonds. Very light coffee astringency plays nicely in the background and balances the large but modestly roasted malt base.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.  Overall a really well balanced beer that makes for a nice sipper.","  rDev Batch #016 06:31  Pours thick and viscous deep dark brown with a dark ivory head that bubbles up slightly, and falls back down just as quick. Not much residual lace, poured pretty cold.  Right out of the can, I get hazelnut, roasty coffee, and vanilla, but also an over abundance of chili peppers (which I double and triple-checked, this is not the chili hazelnut). Definitely odd, kind of throws off the intended pleasantries that I expected. As it warms, the aroma becomes sweeter and that biscotti profile starts to become easier to smell.  Definitely past it’s prime. Roasty coffee and malt take over, with a light vanilla backbone throughout. Still nutty, but it just dies off quickly and I’m tasting that metallic can as it settles on the tongue. I’ll try to be impartial with my rating as I know this can is old and this series is good.   Mouthfeel is a little thin, with a medium carbonation and sticky finish. Warm going down the hatch, subtle burn and bitter finish.","  rDev As good a RIS as any.  a) Pours opaque, dark and thick, with a dense short mocha head, that laces the snifter.  s) Grassy aromas, roasting coffee, malt sugar, vanilla, dried herbs, and a woody overtone. T) More complexity but well-balanced. Herbal, grassy, dark chocolate, tobacco smoke. F) Fit and velvety, perfect weight and gloss.  o) Meditation, oily beer to sip and converse with. A top RIS.","  rDev Deep black color with a thick thin dark caramel head with medium retention. Aroma with notes of lots of nuts, vanilla, coffee and cocoa. Flavor with notes of vanilla, ton of nuts, cocoa, coffee, pepper, earthy and spicy hops, oak, caramel, cinnamon Dry and bitter aftertaste with a lingering roasted nutty and vanilla note. Medium to full creamy body with good carbonation. Alcohol of 11.5% is well disguised. One of the nuttiest RIS I have ever drunk. Vanilla also strikes strongly, so that traditional coffee and cocoa notes stay in the backyard. Interesting, not really inviting for more revisiting.","  rDev Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is pitch black with a small brown head. The aroma is coffee and roasted malt. The tasted follows the nose with a sweet caramel addition.","  rDev Purchase from the US. Served chilled into a chalice. Batch #016. 1 Pint can.  Appearance - Dark, very dark nearing engine oil black. A finger of fluffy dark tan head is poured, staying for some time and leaving behind a thin curtain of lacing. Obscures all light.  Smell - Wet coffee grounds, almonds and vanilla extract. Not a lot else, and the vanilla is a little too sweet for my liking.  Taste - Sweet initially, then some coffee shines through with some astringent prickliness. Almonds are a nice touch but the vanilla finishes quite sweet. Reminds me of Victory at Sea with extra vanilla sweetness and hints of almonds. Also not quite as good. Coffee is quite subdued all things considered. Not sure if this is a so called pastry stout, but at the very least would seem to straddle that line. Chocolate mixed in for good measure. Alcohol is not terribly well hidden although that's hard to do at 11.5% ABV. Bubblegum is something else that comes to mind with a fake banana flavor after repeated visits.  Mouthfeel - Astringent prickliness when the coffee flavor kicks in, otherwise, dense and chewy. Slick going down the gullet with some alcohol burn.  Overall - A pretty good big boy stout, wish there was a little more bitterness and less vanilla going on in Imperial Biscotti Break, but otherwise a tasty brew that I'm fortunate to have another 3 cans of. Considering the rep, I'm somewhat disappointed, but everyone has beers that they feel this way about.","  rDev Who doesn't love New Beer Sunday? How CAN you not enjoy a CANportunity to really do some damage under the auspices of doing something New? Happy Even More Even More Evil Twin Sunday (Week 678) as I delve even deeper into this madness!  From the CAN:  Imperial Stout brewed with Coffee and with Almond and Vanilla added ;  Italy has a certain 'je ne sais quoi' - fab food culture, highly decadent history of art and cool countryside. Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the soccer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that's all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant, and extravagant. Forza Italia.   I wanted to Crack! this CAN open &amp; CANduct an inverted Glug in retaliation for the CANsense of the last one, but that was not fitting. Instead, I went with a slow, gentle Glug. Unbidden, it still formed a finger of foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was as sweet as the previous gem, loads of nuttiness &amp; vanilla, but the coffee was taking a back seat. This brewery pi**ed me off with the last one, an overpriced p.o.s. &amp; this was doing naught to repair the damage! Biscotti? Not on the nose! Coffee? Not on the nose! Added almond &amp; vanilla? Fine. A check of the style descriptor lets you off of the hook, but I am NOT happy. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, less than what I would &amp; CAN expect in the style. The taste was odd with an initial coffee bitterness, but tempered with a nuttiness that I could not readily identify along with a very identifiable vanilla sweetness. Biscotti? I am unsure. I love Biscotti from Enrico's in Pixburgh's Strip Disrick, but this was not evocative of any of their variegated products. I found myself wishing that they could have found a happier medium between the coffee and the almond flavors while leaving the vanilla in the beta stage. Almond infused coffee is bangin', yo, but this lacked that kind of CANpelling quality. Instead, it seemed kind of CANfused, wandering from coffee to nutty and finishing with a vague sweetness, perhaps of vanilla, but I would not swear to it. Finish was equally difficult to quantify - semi-sweet or semi-dry? Pick one, 'cause I CANnot. I was unimpressed.","  rDev Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malts, coffee, vanilla and a certain nutty, marzipan-like quality. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by roasted, caramel malt, coffee, vanilla and marzipan, with notes of chocolate and licorice. Smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonisation. Finishes with a light, dry bitterness. Very nicely balanced, especially between sweetness and bitterness, with an intriguing marzipan-quality throughout and notes of coffee, chocolate and vanilla.","  rDev Pour is black, the slightest bit of leakage to mahogany on the edges, and a bubbly tan head. The first note I get on the nose is stone fruit, but there’s also a bit of char and cocoa, and there’s a significant vanilla note as well.  The taste is dominated at first by the stone fruit, but the chocolate and vanilla notes come forward as this warms, and the almond makes a very brief appearance in the form of a nutty flavor at the very end of the taste.  The mouthfeel is fine, but if it had more gravitas, this beer would be at the tippity top of the imperial stout pile. It is still an excellent choice.","  rDev I’m bloody excited about this one - so excited it jumped right to the front of my backlog queue of beers to review. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. I don’t even know when [yes I do], but FINALLY I have my hands on Evil Twin Imperial Biscotti Break, and I’m going to drink the shit out of it... eww. Prepare thyself for this review of an 11.5% ABV (they don’t skimp on the ABV these ET peeps) American Imperial Stout brewed with coffee, almond and vanilla, as it will be my finest hour... unless it’s my darkest hour [ha-ha, Stout pun]. You’ll find out soon enough. That said I have noticed a corollary between me getting tipsy and my reviews getting funnier, so at least there’s a good spot of humour to look forward if nothing else “forza Italia” the can label proclaims, force Italy indeed.  Poured from a 473ml can into a Duvel tulip.  A: Fairly impenetrable black body with a reasonable 2 centimetre cappuccino foam tan head that ever slowly drops back. Well it’s a Stout surely. Impressive as the other Imperial Stouts out there. 8/10.  S: Almond comes across from the off as a bold amaretto note, vanilla plays a supporting role, coffee is the stand-in actor plotting to take out almond with a laxative tea on opening night - ever malevolent that coffee character. Overall aroma is completely as advertised on the can, there’s not much else there, however in the best of Omnipollo’s dessert beer tradition do we need much more? Give me sweet, sweet simplicity. Hints of chocolate (dark) come through on a second whiff. 8/10.   T: Flavoursome indeed! Rich dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a hint of almond (was expecting more from the aroma). Let’s get the elephant in the room out the door as it’s shitting all over my fine Persian rug: the mouthfeel is all wrong! Good, well get to that next. Flavourwise it’s pretty well balanced with sweetness edging out bitterness. 11.5% ABV partially hidden by the almonds. Mmm, tasty. 9/10.  M: Thin bodied given the 11.5% ABV - I’ve probably been spoiled by Founders and Omnipollo but the body on this is really thin, bit weak and too carbonated with big bubbles - essentially what you get is a beer that feels a bit like a glass of Coke, bad Evil Twin! [lol] Where are the body adding adjuncts like oats or lactose??? 5/10.  D: What a disappointing mouthfeel for an otherwise decadent and tasty American Imp Stout. The pieces of the puzzle were all there but for some reason they had sandpaper on their backs. Still the rest of the beer was an +A. 8/10.  Food match: Cant stop thinking of biscotti’s now, thanks Evil Twin!","  rDev A 22 fl. oz. bomber with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a snifter.  Appearance: Dark dark brown to black in colour with pretty much no head and only sparse to no lacing.  Aroma: Toasted marshmallow, chocolate, coffee, vanilla with a light almond nuttiness and hints of caramel.  Taste: Roasted dark malt sweetness, chocolate, coffee and vanilla. There is a hint of cherry and nuts on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, thinner than expected at medium to full bodied with low carbonation and nice light alcohol warming.  Overall: Very nice sipper with great aromas and flavours.","  rDev I downed a 0.25l glass of this from draft (€5.00) at Café DeRat in Utrecht on 23SEP17.  Poured jet black, oily and dense. Had a fine, short, creamy mocha head, with very nice lace. Aroma was a lovely mocha/coffe/choco combo, with some dark fruit mixed in. It was creamy and smooth on the tongue, with a chewy medium-plus body.  Tasted rich and semi-sweet, with some subtle roasty malts. Had lots of choco and dark fruit, like chocolate-covered cherries. Also tasted some mocha and licorice, while the dark choco notes lingerd. As it finished, it had a touch of earthy hopping. Very nice!

Produced and bottled for Eviltwin by Westbrook.   A: Dark reddish-khaki toned head is only moderately lasting due to alcohol content, resting above a silky and inky black pour. Clean lacing on the glass (chalice) with a small collection of micro-bubbles gathering on the bottom portion. Nice dark coloring overall.   S: The cinnamon and habanero peppers really shine through here upon first impression with a rich chocolate-coffee like backing. Vanilla-almond creamer like sweetness adds balance and is fresh in nature while some bourbon like flair exists in the alcohol. Sweet cocoa powder and freshly ground coffee make their way mid-palate providing a silky roast backing, reminding me of my very first BCBS. Very nice strength, degree of freshness on both the vanilla and coffee aspect while the habanero provides a nice warming background heat in conjunction with the alcohol at the right temperature. All the additives are easily picked out and have an equal amount of balance and appeal to the sense and very much appreciated.   T: The flavor was rich, silky roast with a rich minerality, expressed with some cinnamon spicing and habanero pepper heat, much like a winter coffee providing warmth and spiciness and absolutely steals the show here. Vanilla sweetness highlights with some rich cocoa nibs and deep chocolate tones that add depth and some sweetness. Campfire minerality silt off the tongue upon the swallow. Dark fruit of plums and raisins along with some milky roast and espresso are there as well some sambuca like licorice tones.   M: Big bready cake malts make this a big and delicious mouthful. Syrupy consistency, heavy on the tongue with a dark warmth of of silky roast coffee teasing the tongue. Quiet carbonation.   O: The alcohol was very well behaved behind the massive flavor appeal, thick coffee roast stout and sweet highlights from the vanilla and cinnamon highlights give this a vast range of flavors that was very well blended and harmonious in nature. The cocoa nibs added sweetness as well the almonds and habanero peppers just the right amount of heat without being obnoxious, rather bring a very pleasant state to the overall drink. All the additives were equally refined and represented and never got lost in the sauce, the fresh nature of the vanilla was darling. The finish was even more stronger and empowering then the first sip, holding ones interest and anticipation towards the next sip. Extremely high drinkability, even priced at $18 bottle this seems like a steal/bargin. Must try.","  rDev L: Jet black color, quarter finger fast dissipating brown head, no lacing to speak of, lots of carbonation.  S: Chocolate, coffee, sweet.  T: Sweet, LOTS of chocolate, a hint of coffee. Just amazing.  F: Highly carbonated but not distracting, full bodied.  O: A truly great imperial stout. Delicious!","  rDev 8/13...pitch black, poured out of the tallboy can, still and dark. Light tan foam around the ring. Vanilla based roasted nose. Nutty hints, almonds. Thick mouthfeel, like coffee syrup. The nutty oily flavors roll in. Definitely taste like a biscotti - and a boozy one at that. Mission accomplished.","  rDev Given the cloying sweetness on display here, I'm surprised this doesn't have a higher pDev. Inviting on the nose, with plenty of the vanilla that was huge in Imperial Biscotti break long before it became so fashionable and long before they started canning it. Even the regular Biscotti variant has hints of cherry on top, and enough liqueur-like, yogurt sweetness to make one speculate about an unwanted lacto infection. The coffee eventually fades to the finish when aged, leaving what I would consider to be a better outcome.","  rDev Growler into pint glass. Pours a very, very dark brown - looks black once it's in the glass, but it's actually sorta dark cola-colored. Nice tan head. Initial impression is brown sugar, coffee, milk chocolate, a touch of vanilla, and a hint of almonds. This is a really smooth stout with all the rough edges buffed and polished - quite surprising for the octane level. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would have expected, and there is a little more carbonation than necessary. Finish is deceptively smooth.  You need to pay attention - this one will sneak up on you preecisely because it's so smooth and well-polished. It's still 11.5% and therefore deserves your respect.  I love Imperial Stouts, and this is one of the better ones."]},{"Name":"Head Hunter","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/19544/50564/","Brewery":"Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.50,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev CANNED ON 06/04/21 on bottom rim of can.

Overall OUTstanding ipa.","  rDev poured from a can dated 2/22  Appearance is crystal clear copper/amber thick fluffy head that reduces to a thin veil light lacing  You can smell the fruit aroma as it's poured, pineapple, mango, citrus and a hint of pine  Taste is full, hoppy and fruity as the nose, notes of pine and floral  mouthfeel is big, medium carbonation, it runs prickly to astringent to a dry finish that hangs on in your throat,  Overall this is a crisp clean refreshing beer, not a sipper","  rDev Growler into pint glass. Pours a crystal clear gold (SRM 5-6) with a persistent off-white head. Great lacing. Initial impression is citrus (pineapple, lemon, grapefruit), pine resin, and a light touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side of medium. Finish fades to a slight bitterness. Overall, a good example of an old-school West Coast IPA.","  rDev Fresh can courtesy of JohnnyHops.  A classic wcipa in the midwestern tradition with malt balance. Very nice.","  rDev A: crystal clear; deep gold in color; 1+ finger finely pored off white head that receded to wispy cap; OK lacing;  S: I could smell the beer as I poured it; pineapple with orange, grapefruit, and mango;  T: follows the nose from start to finish; moderate bitterness at the end;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish;  O: nice complexity of flavor;","  rDev Two 12 oz. cans poured into a clear glass liter mug and a beautiful rich and clear amber beer is let loose. There's a nice off-white head, but very little glass lacing. A wonderful IPA aroma is there for the nose. It's hoppy, just hoppy. Not dank hoppy, not juicy hoppy, it's just hoppy. Head Hunter is a delicious AIPA. The malts provide a great backbone and with the a little hint of alcohol and yeast, just the right amount of sweet balance. The hops are the most pronounced contributor to the flavor. The malts provide enough body to make this very pleasant to consume. Truly an outstanding American IPA.","  rDev Crystal clear copper with a small white head. Great retention.  The aroma sings of fresh grapefruit and orange zest, crushed pine needles, honey and some tart mango.  The taste follows the nose. Bittersweet and oily orange and grapefruit upfront, peel and juicy equally represented. There is a backbone of tart mango. Pine dominates through a lot of the palate. The malt is biscuit and honey; but super crisp and dry. A bit of black tea, and then finishes with more pine and grapefruit peel. Moderately bitter. Extremely dry and crisp.  Fizzy and well carbonated, slightly oily, medium mouthfeel; quite clean and dry.  An excellent West Coast style IPA. Very well done.","  rDev Pours a golden straw color and had a nice, short lived head. The aroma is strong bordering on citrus and the hops. More hops than malt. The taste is way different from anything I've had before. That makes it unique. I think I can see the West Coast style as it's less malty. It's very clean and tasty. No bitterness. Smooth as silk and a fabulous easy drinking mouthfeel. I suppose they could be slammed down before you realize you're wasted. Overall this beer is really awesome. I could get used to having these around all time. I could do another one right now. From a 12 ounce can dated 02/19/20 into a Hopslam glass. From a GREAT guy in PA.","  rDev 12 oz bottle split with my brother-in-law, dated 11-14-19. A clean, citrusy, relatively bitter American IPA. Some pine resin and a hint of vegetal dankness. Complex, drinkable, and delicious.","  rDev Bottled on 9/5/19; consumed on 9/24/19  Pours a clear golden orange body topped with multiple fingers of dense white foam; excellent retention fades slowly to a thick cap and lasting variety of bubbly, soapy lacing.  Aromas open with hoppy floral tones and a bit of malty spice, leading to a marriage of pine/evergreen and sweet grapefruit; accents of a tropical edge featuring mango pineapple, as well as a flaky malt sweetness.  Taste brings resinous evergreen and pineapple emanating through the profile, touched with light grapefruit zest and flaky malts; building tropical depth continues to reveal its layers as it evolves along the palate.  Mouthfeel presents a medium body and balancing medium carbonation; deeply resinous across the mid-palate as a vague tartness develops alongside a moderate bitterness drying into the swallow; so much brought to the table without overwhelming the palate.  Aggressive in approach, yet so level in its temperament/execution; a pure example of balance in an American IPA, and one I could drink virtually ad infinitum.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, bottled on 05/21/19; purchased cold single... poured into nonic)  L: polished-clear, amber liquid; tall 2-plus finger-high mattress of dull white foam... rocksteady, spitty cap kept, but somehow not much lace - what's left though is crystal-y splotches  S: subtly pepper-spiced dried sweet mango, pineapple right behind it; aromas popping hard as soon as crown popped... does the alcohol have a vague coconut rum note? hmm... moderate, green-leafy overtones  T: oodles of layered hop (resins), dried mango still ripping, but with a firm-yet-frayed, flower petal/stem mashed green bitterness providing a counterpoint... vague lemon-orange hard candy essence in the aftertaste, malt undeniably has armor of light-crystal malt, but its altogether not very sweet... bit of grapefruit starts emerging around halfway  F: ghostly plush rush up front, fanned out with the mellow blast of (spicy) boozy warmth in the finish; warmth starts to linger early on... perfect amount of alcohol heat (and its influence) against the smoothly-rounded, but smartly clipped fade  O: vibrant, intense hop flavors, the nuances of which are not exactly my favorite,especially matched against the bold (yet curiously-clipped) crusty crystal malts... nothing new experienced here - it's basically alcoholic hop candy... another mis-categorized amber? (1481)","  rDev I had known about this brew for ages but had never seen it so was pleasantly surpised to see a six pack in a Sheetz across from my hotel near Pittsburgh while in town for a concert. Pours with a bright amber hue, excellent clarity and a moderate head. Nose is bursting with a rainbow of tropical fruit flavors.  Flavor is varied, with blasting, bitter pine flavors ombinined with mint and medicinal qualities as well as the same tropical fruits from the nose. Enough balance to keep your face from puckering, but not a lot. The texture is dainty and thin but able to carry the heavy flavor load. This label proudly proclaims this beer to be  uncivilized and aggressive .","  rDev Great, crisp, refreshing IPA that lives up to its stellar reputation. Pours an amber color with some great looking fluffy white head and smaller sheets of lingering lacing. Smells great, some citrus zest hops in the foreground - grapefruit, lemon, orange, pineapple - as well as some malt, vanilla, faint nuttiness and some great floral and piney notes. Taste follows the nose, and the hit of hoppy bitterness at the end is so bracing and refreshing and powerful, yet so well balanced with the weaker sweet malt backbone. Smooth, mild, slightly sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation. A pleasure to drink, easy to enjoy and the higher ABV is well-hidden.","  rDev Head Hunter brewed by Fat Head's Brewery &amp; Saloon, with an ABV of 7.50% This American IPA pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer. The color is a deep golden amber color with, a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with hop bitterness mixed with earthy grains and malts. You also pick up some mild sweetness mixed with citrus. So far this brew has the look an smell of most American IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. This is a nice inviting IPA, now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors, lots of grapefruit mixed with hop bitterness. Then the brew milds out with some nice earthy grains and malts. This is well put together American IPA. The body of Head Hunter, is medium to heavy, but not to heavy. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.50% ABV on this be, it is just that smooth. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Head Hunter a solid 4 out of 5 I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity too. Fat Head's Brewery &amp; Saloon, did a real nice job with this brew.","  rDev ** 04/16/19  On tap, kite and key, Philadelphia.  Full yellow. Clear. Big healthy off white head. Good retention.

Not much to this but it's balanced &amp; mildly enjoyable.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours a crystal clear deep Amber color with 2 fingers of frothy off-white head. The head leaves a ton of splotchy lacing as it settles into a halo.  The aroma is all about dat citrus: Grapefruit, tangerines and oranges followed by a wave of earthy pine.  The flavor is full of citrus with some subtle notes of pineapple and mango. Very earthy and piney. The back end is full of caramel malts. Nicely balanced.  The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit slick and oily, but creamy and smooth. Easy drinking.  Overall, a great IPA that brings the West Coast vibe but never overwhelms the palate. Definitely a beer worth having in your fridge.","  rDev 12oz bottled 1/8/19 (46 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV 87 IBU. The beer pours bright light honey amber in color with pale khaki head. The head starts big and recedes to a fluffy island and ring leaving the entire glass laced. The aroma is candied orange, pine and slight dank. The taste is more piney, candied orange with an earthy bitterness that builds toward a mostly dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. There is some definite stickiness from the hops and malt, but it doesn't come off as sweet. Overall, excellent.","  rDev A: Coppery orange with a full head.   S: Blood orange spiced tea. Grapefruit zest.   M: Slick and oily. Med body.   T: Punch of citrus, left hook of pine resin. Papaya and melon finishing blow. Tropical hard candy with a sour coating and grapefruit jelly interior. This reminds me of the IPAs that got me into this site in the first place.","  rDev On tap at Tria Taproom in Philadelphia.  Pours a clear amber with thck, fluffy head.  Smell is piney and citrusy with some resinous grapefruit coming through.  Taste is unabashedly bitter and piney, but perfectly balanced. Strong notes of citrus, grapefruit in particular helps round it out.  Mouthfeel is medium, sticky and well carbonated.  Overall, a terrific old school west coast IPA. Reminds me a bit of Alesmith IPA, but a bit more bitter.","  rDev From the first sip, this was a fine IPA...  I always, and I mean always, pick up a six to twelve pack of beers of different variety and styles. Many times picking up a beer simply because it is inexpensive with the hope it will be surprisingly good, but as is the case the majority of the time - it is not. Well, not in this case. This was one of the better IPAs I have had in quite some time, and I'm really not an IPA-guy. The looks was copperish with yellow highlights with a mouthfeel that was spicy and medium bodied. What impressed me the most was the smell and taste. The smell was a punch in the nose of citrus - grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, and even some lemon and lime. The taste was just as citrusy and juicy and just damn good from beginning to end. Outstanding IPA at the very least from the most unexpected of places.","  rDev Golden hued body with a fine foamy head; bits of lacing clinging to the glass. Spicy, herbal and pine aroma. Crystal malt base (it seems like) with a spicy, peppery hop taste; very bitter. Medium body; dry and prickly on the palate.  A most righteous IPA from Ohio, Head Hunter nails the west coast style and truly satisfies.","  rDev Today is the occasion of New Fat Rusty Head Rail Sunday (Week 714) &amp; while we just began receiving distro of Fat Head's beers, we do not get the full oeuvre as yet.

I Pop!ped the cap &amp; began a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass as my nod to respecting the resin. It respected me in return by forming just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with good retention that left a mess of sticky lacing in its wake. Color was Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7) with NE-quality clarity, causing The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas &amp; Croesus to get off of the sofa, where they were watching NFL football, and join me in the kitchen for a taste. Nose smelled oily &amp; resinous, like Simcoe the kitty doing her kitty business in a pine forest. What a naughty little kitty! She may have also had some caramel with her. Just sayin'. Mouthfeel was big, solid &amp; firm, almost to a DIPA level. The 87 IBUs kicked in right away, giving me a warm feeling from my gullet down to my belly. Phew! The taste was pine, caramel, grapefruit &amp; kitty p*ss, reminding me of how &amp; why I got turned onto AIPAs in the first place. Mmm. It was like a punch inna face with a glove filled with hops! You'd better like 'em dank &amp; resinous or this will not be your bag. Finish was strong, bitter, dry, everything that I ask for in/from the style.","  rDev My first from Fat Heads, so I went on their website. A successful family business 25 years old and now full of friends and admirers as customers. So who am I to pan their cash cow? I won't.  Being a malt-head, it is hard for me to review any ale that bitters-up my buds. And since it is a critique that usually falls on deaf ears, I move on. But bravo to Fat Heads for showing the way.","  rDev Poured from a 12oz glass into a high sided pilsner glass.   Look is a clear orange amber with a white head.   Aroma is aggressive hops with a deep rich caramel malt.   Taste is a delicious combo of malt and hops.   Excellent beer.","  rDev Had a bottle at D'agnese Italian restaurant in Richfield Ohio. Served in a pint glass, this beer was a clear, amber color with a small white head. Good lacing and retention. Aroma and flavor featured citrus (grapefruit) and dry, biscuity malt. Good strong favor and nice level of bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and rich with the balance favoring the hops. I would drink this one again.","  rDev First had poured from 12-oz. bottle, neck stamped “BOTTLED ON 06/11/18,” into hotel water glass. You are greeted at the door with a huge hop hug, then malt slides over, says hello and hangs around, while hops firmly but friendly escort you to an IPA throw down.","  rDev Horse a clear, copper - Orange with a one finger off - White head. Good combination with some lacing. A wonderful smell of citrus hop. Gives off more of a melon, mango and orange Citrus smell. Also a sweet candy smell. The Taste follows the smell and includes pineapple. A wonderful combination of Citrus and pine bitterness and malt. This one is spot-on! Good dankness that resinated.

I think it's under utilized in beer, as I've run across maybe 2 or 3 of these beers. Anyhow, I knew I couldn't pass up on a hazelnut brown ale. It seems like an oddball style to add hazelnut to, but I guess nut brown ale is a thing so it isn't too far fetched. Let's dive in  Pours a murky brown with ruby highlights and 2 fingers of tan head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  The layering in the nose is pulled off wonderfully, constantly switching between dessert-y and nutty malt. I'm picking up on aromas of dried nuts, creamy hazelnut, milk chocolate, toasty bready malt, earthy hops, and rich toffee  Unfortunately, this loses quite a bit of its charm when translated to the taste, but it's still enjoyable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dried nutty malt, earthy hops, a touch of dark fruit, and toast. The swallow opens up and sweetens things, bringing notes of rich hazelnut, milk chocolate, raisin, bready malt, caramel, and a touch of astringent hops  A light medium body pairs with gentle tingly carbonation, resulting in a somewhat thin but still flavorful beer. Finishes almost completely dry, with the sweetness offset in the aftertaste  This one was a bit of a rollercoaster. If everything followed the nose, this might be one of the best brown ales I've ever had. But alas, that's not the case. For what it is, though, it's still quite tasty","  rDev 355 ml can, from Vinoble Frederikshavn. ABV is 5.6%. Deep nut brown colour, small off-white to beige head. Aroma of hazelnut extract, brown malts and coffee. The flavour has the same elements, and is not too sweet. Minimal hops,  dead  finish. Won't buy again.","  rDev From a 12 oz can from a mixed twelve pack picked up at Gateway Liquors in Thurmont, MD. Brilliant sweet caramel note over the dark malt base in the nose. This has an ultra smooth texture for the style, and is pretty clean as far as the style is concerned. This is a little oversweet for me with the milk chocolate and mixed nut notes. Still, this is complex and worthy within the style, even if Browns aren't always my thing.","  rDev L:. Pours a dark brown with hints of orange where the light hits it, pours a foamy tan head and a few thick fingers of lacing.  S:. Toasted bread, nutty earthy malt, a good hazelnut, notes of sweet malt.

L: Pours a clear, deep ruby brown under a finger of tight tan foam. Mediocre retention, only a couple tiny spots of lacing. Nice color, but fairly forgettable.  S: Hazelnut is present but in the background, with rich malt dominating. Sweet, fruity, nutty, bready. More peanut butter than hazelnut as it warms, but always complex and enjoyable.  T: Follows the nose, with nutty malt, sweet caramel, and dried fruit. On the finish it dries out with a hint of herbal hops, leaving a clean aftertaste. Flavorful, drinkable, balanced. Really nice brew.  F: Soft, lively medium body. Excellent.  O: Great Brown. It's not a style I often gravitate to these days, but this one really reminds me about how much I enjoyed them in my gateway days. I was afraid the hazelnut would be overwhelming, but it's really well integrated. Best Rogue I've had in years, maybe ever.   Beers of Fame tick 194/250.

Medium to light bodied. More hazelnut at the finish.  O: Pretty average and I don't get the sky high ratings. A reasonable brown ale with some hazelnut creamer.

Ran me $1.69 USD plus tax at Martin Wine Cellar, Metairie, Louisiana.   Ale with natural hazelnut flavor.  5.6% ABV. 33 IBUs. 14 degrees plato.  AROMA: Nutella. Chocolate malt.  TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Artificial, hitting on a hazelnut flavour/extract instead of true hazelnut. Shallow chocolate malts and brown malts lie beneath the surface fake hazelnut flavour. It does have a hint of roast, which helps even it out (I guess it comes from the kiln coffee malts). Balanced and enjoyable if you can get past the artificial hazelnut taste.  Smooth, coating, wet, medium-bodied, not unrefreshing, well-carbonated.  OVERALL: Not the cloying Nutella brown one might fear, but its artificiality makes it tough to recommend. I'd sooner reach for Bell's brown ale if after an easy drinking affordable expression of the style, and this doesn't hold a candle to the best of the best (i.e. Founders' Underground Mountain Brown). I guess this dazzled 20 years ago...shows how far we've come if so.  C+ (3.24) / ABOVE AVERAGE","  rDev From notes 9/2/12: Pours a clear dark brown with 1.5 fingers of tan, finely bubbled, rapidly diminishing head that leaves only tiny motes of lace. Aroma is bready toast, roasted hazelnut, creamed coffee and some cocoa in a thin vanilla and caramel background. Taste is dark bread, toast, roasted hazelnuts, sweet caramel, toffee, dark chocolate, some pepper and light smoke. Rogue yeast is also there. Finish is dry, peppery hop spice and lightly bitter. Aftertaste is slightly burnt and nicely bitter. Very Good.

Of course, I was probably just waiting for them to begin putting their beers in CANs. That is just a CANQuest (tm) postulation, but I'm sticking with it. My last beer was a massive hazelnut beer, so this one makes about as much sense as anything else associated with me.

Whaddya think, I've reverted back to my old ways?!? OcCANsionally, but not in this case. No, I was a good boy &amp; I was rewarded with an opportunity to CANduct an in-glass swirl. This raised just over a finger of soapy, foamy, light-tan head with extremely limited retention. Color was Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = &gt; 22, &lt; 27), but closer to 22 with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a maple syrupy sweetness along with the unmistakable scent of hazelnut. Mmm. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, not watery, but nothing worth crowing about, either. The taste was rather sweet, but given the laxity of the site's Style descriptor, it was not a problem. It was less an American Brown Ale as an opportunity for them to Dare &amp; Risk with what CAN be an overwhelming flavor when it comes to hazelnut. I liked that they did not go over the top and allowed the malts to also have a chance. I was really reminded of hazelnut coffee at one point as it warmed. Finish was semi-sweet, bordering on outright sweet, which CAN be too much for me. However, in reviewing to style &amp; not to taste, it was fine. One was plenty for me. YMMV.","  rDev Canned 1/16/18; drank 4/2/18 @ the Yarchives.   Muddy brown/orange appearance.   A violent pour yielded a huge khaki head; strong, frothy lace.   Hazelnut, light roast coffee bean, mild cream &amp; faint acorn notes in the nose.   Medium thin mouthfeel.   Hazelnut, spring water &amp; faint citrus flavors up front; light roast coffee &amp; faint acorn notes on the finish.   Thin, but not distractingly so; nice flavors.

Nose is earthy and a little malty, and the hazelnut certainly comes through. Unfortunately, it honestly smells a little weird and out of place. Taste is very much the same. Nice caramel from the malt and some good earthy notes. However, the hazelnut is once again a little weird and out of place. Overall, probably not something I'll have again. It would be quite good without the weird hazelnut.","  rDev From a can, this brew is a dark brown color with cerise hues in the light. Slim head. The aroma has a lot of hazelnut...woody, sweetish, earthy. Along with the nut scent is a bit of amber malt. The taste is drier than I expected, with nutty, woody flavors. Full in body.","  rDev L: Hazy dark brown with some ruby red at the bottom. The head is beige and small, but a thin film remains.  S: Surprisingly huge and sweet; immense amounts of hazelnut, milk chocolate, maple syrup, coffee, vanilla, earth, and wood. Smells like coffee and hazelnut ice cream.  T: Toasted hazelnut, caramel, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, maple syrup, milk chocolate, coffee, vanilla, cream, date, fig, and raisin. Hints of light smoke. Earth and wood chips.  F: Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated. Smooth and well-rounded, finishing slightly sweet.  O: A killer brown ale! My only complaint is that it's a little too sweet, but this is delicious and complex.","  rDev It pours brown and very clear with hardly any head. The aroma is full of hazelnut (not so much the roasted kind but more like hazelnut coffee). Rather sweet with some late bitterness. Very light mouthfeel.","  rDev I love hazelnuts but I guess I'm not a big fan of hazelnut flavor in beer - or aroma for that matter. Luckily the beer paired very well with zucchini nut bread or I may have had a tough time finishing it. The base beer is a very solid brown ale.","  rDev Nice color and aroma. No head and flat. Not too old - dated 30 March and it's 11June.","  rDev 650 ml bottle served cool into a pint glass. Purchased from the LCBO for about $8 CDN. Produced July 25, 2016. This edition is advertised at 5.6% ABV.  Appearance - pours a most clear honey brown color with some amber hues. A decadent and fluffy finger and change of light beige head is poured with impressive staying power. Some frothy lacing sticks around the sides of the glass for a good long while.  Smell - nuts and honey are the initial impression with some gentle smelling coarse grain in the background. Not a lot else, but light and an easy to digest aromatic bouquet.   Taste - nuts are certainly the focus with some gentle grassy hops and a sweetness that is reminiscent of honey. Could be a little caramel in there too but the sweetness is rather restrained, giving for a very wholesome taste.  Mouthfeel - super smooth and light bodied for a near 6% ABV brew. Carbonation is active but melds nicely. Feels like a very good nut brown ale.  Overall - this delight reminds me of another of my favourite nut ales, the one from Samuel Smith. Light bodied, easy drinking with a great flavor profile and an attractive aroma, what's not to like other than the price. Certainly worth a Try and probably a repeat tasting as well.","  rDev A: crystal clear; at first glance, it appears to be a medium brown in color, but when held to the light, it is a reddish ruby; less than a 1 finger khaki head that receded to a thin collar; no lacing;  S: milk chocolate, nutty, roasted grains;  T: milk chocolate for a moment, then nutty with roasted grains; there is something a little sharp about the flavor - it's not especially smooth drinking; very mild bitterness on the finish;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; lightly dry finish;  O: a let down for sure; good, but not great;","  rDev Bomber purchased at the LCBO, listed at 5.6%.

I'm getting lots of hazelnut on the nose, in addition to cocoa, white chocolate and vanilla. Hints of sponge toffee, pecan and toasty, earthy, nutty goodness. Love the aroma on this one.  Tons of hazelnut flavour to sift through here, with the additional presence of chocolate/cocoa butter flavours giving it a bit of a Nutella vibe at points. Hints of coffee, pecan and cashew, with subtle vanilla flavours surfacing on the back end; finishes with a nutty, chocolatey note and some light earthy, herbal hop bitterness that doesn't quite manage to overpower the more saccharine facets of the profile. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation levels that gently nudge the surface of the palate, imparting a very low-level bite to the texture of this otherwise soft, exceptionally smooth brown ale. Easy to drink, but I don't think it's something I'd want to drink one after another.  Final Grade: 4.08, an impressive A-. Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar is an undeniably solid American brown - although if you happen to feel that the hazelnut extract flavour is a bit overplayed, I can see where you're coming from. As someone who enjoys that flavour, it didn't really bug me - but people who are more sensitive to hazelnut might find this to be a little too sweet and cloying for their tastes. Worth picking up while it's available in Ontario, if you're at all a fan of malt-forward browns.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with off white head. Aroma is sweet toffee nutty. Taste is sweet hazelnut honey like with a malty hazelnut finish. Too sweet for my tastes."]},{"Name":"Saison Dupont","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/637/1717/","Brewery":"Brasserie Dupont sprl","Style":"Farmhouse Ale - Saison","Alcohol":6.50,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev 11.2oz - found overpriced singles at Total Wine after the nice gal at the local death merchant ordered me some 4-packs  Looks amazing, chunky and looking like DUFF otherwise.

I used a tulip glass and the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a massive three-fingered head with excellent retention. The off-white head is airy and foamy. Gobs of lacing were left on the glass as it dissipated. . The color is SRM 6, pale straw with amber hues. The beer is mostly clear with a few rouge yeast bubbles floating.   The initial aromas in the beer are straw, horse blanket, and sour lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, floral, a touch of fruity esters, wet grass, and a dank basement. Taking a few more minutes smelling the beer I get a hint of banana and white pepper. The flavors in the beer are straw, funky barnyard, a touch of horse blanket, fruity esters, cloves, banana, mowed hay, toasted crackers, bay leaves, tarragon, and morning dew.   The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, crisp, and slightly tart.   The body of the beer is light, medium carbonation, and medium-light finish.   This beer is fantastic, the only thing that I am not liking is the beer has a touch of light struck. The flavors of the beer would make Sunday dinner on a cool summer night amazing. The beer will pair well with any communal foods. I am enjoying this beer on a hot summer day. Cheers!","  rDev Poured cold from 750-ml bottle into a champagne flute. Quite the gusher: a tentative pour foamed right out of the glass. Once things settled a bit, the appearance was impressive. Clear, light golden colored body, with a voluminous snow-white head that exhibited good retention and some spotty lacing. Aromas and flavors are typical of the Belgian yeast profile (e.g. clove, banana), with floral, herbal, and barnyard notes. There is also a slight umami character. The finish is dry, with pleasant bitterness and a peppery spice kick. Great table beer that complements all sorts of food. Overall, an outstanding beer and well worth seeking out.","  rDev Appearance: Cloudy gold, good thick head.  Smell: Grassy, hay, spicy, yeast note-clove? I think.  Taste: Spicy, black pepper, grassy and hay flavor. Very mild sweetness. Very carbonated, bubbly feel.  Overall: Finally trying this classic beer. I've never been a big saison guy even though most that I've had have been quality beverages. I suppose it's the price upcharge versus a light wheat ale or pilsner that deters me. Anyway, this was a good beer, nice mix of flavors.","  rDev Brasserie Dupont 'Saison' @ 6.5% , served from a 330 ml bottle A-pour is a clear gold from the bottle to a hazy gold in the glass with a medium white head leaving a fine spotty lace along the chalice S-Belgian yeast dominates T-true saison , almost good MF-decent carbonation , nice full body Ov-if I liked saison's great beer ... truly deserve better prost LampertLand","  rDev Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a BA Teku. A slightly orange color with suspension, a lovely lasting head and loads of carbonation. The aroma is heavenly. The acidic sweet and sour smell is inviting. The taste is slightly citrus, fruity and subdued. Slightly fizzy and citric the mouthfeel is very nice. Overall it's interesting and pleasing. I think I'll have another.","  rDev Bottle from new leaf aptos. Cork says 2019.  Look: hazy opaque copper, light fluffy off-white head that retains forever. Smell: Banana, bubblegum, barnyard.  Taste:Banana/fruit variety of sweetness, some mushroom/horse blanket action. Little tart, brett, Faint peppery.  Feel: medium, dry Overall: though not mind-blowing I think this deserves a lot of respect for all its history. An authentic old saison like this is very special. Great to accompany farm work.","  rDev Although I have enjoyed this beer so many times I can't believe that I haven't reviewed it. So here goes  A – Pours a beautiful cloudy straw colour wit a large pure White head that stays the distance. S – Massive herbal aromas with pine, lemon, a small amount of funk and yeast. I don’t know of any other beer that smells like this. T – Big flavours of classic Belgian yeast with straw, lemon citrus and some sourness M – Medium body with full carbonation O – Make no mistake this is the benchmark for this this style, the only one that can match this beer is the Fantome Ghost. Its also fantastic value for money so to me this is one of the best beers around. Non Belgian breweries cannot come close to this beer as a style. Some of the reviews on here are laughable. Either you don't know what a Saison should taste like, or you are so used to locally brewed versions of Saison that this is alien to you. Trust me this is what a Saison should taste like in its true form.","  rDev Bottle. Large white head. Lace. Active carbonation. Golden orange color.   One of the best saisons out there. Classic barnyard hay and straw notes. Grassy with light lemon citrus. Some orange peel and Belgium yeast notes. Spices. Wheat flavors. Faint bubblegum sweetness in the finish. Dry and bubbly. Easy drinking. World class beer.","  rDev A mountainous cloud of white rocky head rides tall and proud over a clear golden amber liquid. Aromatic lemon/lemongrass waft out of the glass, swirling together with herbal notes and fresh hay. The taste flips the script with fresh, sweet hay front and center with light peppery notes, red clover, crackery malt and faint citrus playing supporting roles. Herbal bitter hop bite on the tail end Mouthfeel is crazy smooth, almost creamy. Exceptionally quaffable Overall this is a true standard bearer for the style. A beer I could drink endlessly. An honest to goodness classic","  rDev A: Amber orange in color with lots of chunks of yeast, and a lovely craggy white head.  S: lightly floral with citrus and earthy hops.  T: earthy hop character, light citrus, some Belgian character.   M: soft feel, light body, dry finish.  O: simply made, simply delicious.","  rDev Pours an inviting golden. Notes of lemon, hay, and funk on the nose. There's also some herbal fragrance, I get some heather. It's very dry, with nice herbaceous hop character. Some of that clovey yeast character shines as well. A very drinkable saison.","  rDev Bottled 4/11/19; drank 11/5/19 @ the Yarchives.   Cloudy orange/yellow appearance; some khaki flotsam.   An even pour yielded a huge bright white head; strong, frothy lace.   Banana, clove &amp; mild burnt caramel notes in the nose.   Medium mouthfeel.   Banana &amp; clove flavors up front; mild burnt caramel &amp; faint cream notes on the finish...as well as a stinging carbonation bite.   A bit rough on that carbonation, but overall this had nice depth.","  rDev 330mL bottle stamped L19271B 15:49:16 (about 40 days old if it's a Julian bottle date, but I'm sure that can't be right) poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 6.5% ABV. The beer pours hazy on a careful pour with some small yeast particulate falling to the bottom of the glass. The color is orange amber with fizzy nearly white head. The head recedes to a pencil thin ring and small island of tiny bubbles. Little retention, no lacing. The aroma is complex with farmhouse funk, ripe stone fruit and hints of clove and banana. The taste is sharp with musty barnyard, funky cheese, over ripe fruit and earth. The finish is moderately bitter and completely bone dry. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with above average carbonation. Overall, excellent. This is a tasty and very complex beer.","  rDev Bottle reads ‘L18122A’ (presumably bottled on 5/2/2018)  Pours a faintly cloudy golden yellow capped with a billowing, fairly dense white head; constant effervescence; great retention results in big layers of thicker webbed lacing and a persistent cap.  Aromas of yeasty clove, light spice, and plenty of banana/fruity esters make strong impressions as the beer hits the glass; herbal funk and vague hints of damp cellar develop, adding a definite earthy depth; semi-sweet bouquet, but dried out with an earthy, musty funk.  Taste brings a more straightforward tandem of herbal spice and dried wood, with esters of orchards fruit, light banana, and clove pop up intermittently along the palate; subtle depth, with earthy aspects tending to overwhelm.  Mouthfeel is lighter bodied and packs a heavy carbonation that adapts on the palate quickly, drying out to a light bitterness; incredible crispness overpowers a slight oily texture, rendering it mostly to a comfortable position at the back of the tongue; the balance is impressive, and it’s refreshing to an extreme.  It’s reputation as a standard of the style is certainly appropriate; it melds sweeter Belgian yeast notes against a concentrated variety of earthy, herbal farmhouse funk, and is tied together with a deft refinement that delivers great quaffability.","  rDev Nice Belgian saison - although not my typical style, I could still appreciate the complexity and smoothness. Pours a lighter golden-orange color with loads of foamy white head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells strongly of Belgian yeast, banana, clove, raisin and malt. Taste follows the nose, and although the flavors were a little strong for me I could appreciate how well-balanced they were. Smooth, slightly creamy, mild mouthfeel with good carbonation. I’d definitely try more from this brewery.","  rDev L- Luckily I poured this 330ml bottle into a 570ml pint glass, as even poured reeeally slowly it yielded a huge pillowy head. Mid gold colour, very slight haze, 6cm fine-bubble just off-white head reducing veeery slowly. S- Bright smelling fresh fruit such as apple, smells quite 'dry' vs having a rich aroma. T- Wow, something different, it tastes slightly of apple too, with a quite rich and rewarding middle, and a hoppy and slightly sour build into the finish. F- You can feel the heft of the 6.5% ABV, in fact blind tasted I'd likely guess this as a touch higher, 7.5% or so. Despite which given the balanced taste I could enjoy a few of these. O- I've had this before and forgot to rate it, I'm glad I bought it again, just a shame it's pretty $. It's beautifully balanced, with nothing out of place, and certainly refreshing for this ABV%. Unusual balance, heft, richness + refreshing tang = extrememly drinkable! Bought from The Beer Shop at 97 Golborne Road, London W10, a place that's just opened this month. 330ml £2.85 BB: 10/2021 Ps. It's bottle conditioned, you might want to rest it to settle and drink a few days later. Even then be ready to pour veeery slowly indeed!","  rDev Cloudy murky orange color . Medium body with plenty of effervescent carbonation . Aroma is a really nice mix of yeast,malt, doughy bread, earthy, wood, a small amount of citrus peel . Taste follows the nose but with a slightly sharp, dry, bitterness that lingers. All the flavors are there but not screaming loud, just sort of mellow and blended with each other well. It's not sweet really at all and more of a bitter bite than the aroma hinted at. Paired it with baked apples and it was a perfect match","  rDev 11.2oz bottle with a code of L16399A 11:50:35 (opened 1-6-18) Huge 2 + rocky head with amazing retention....settles in at 1/4  for the duration. Gold, peach opaque with a good rush of visible carbonation. Some sediment clinging to the sides of the glass. Thick lacing. Deep, fruity, spicy nose. Apples, baked apples, apricot...layers of fruit. Yeast aromas are apparent. Fruit, dried fruit. Just a hint of Brett funk shows. Fruit followed by spice followed by a hoppy hit that's herbal. Medicinal/phenolic quality that's in small measure and only adds to the complexity. Medium to full body with full carbonation. Dry finish full of fruit. High drinkability. Really, really good - will keep this one on a short list. I'd like to understand their coding to understand the beer better.","  rDev Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a custom pint; coded L17484A (late ?2017).  A: Pours a very hazy, dark golden, essentially aged bronze color with a two finger, fluffy, off white head with very strong retention and foamy lacing. S: Grassy and especially grainy aromas initially with banana, apple, and clover emergent. T: Semisweet. Apple and grainy flavors mix with spice (cloves and pepper) and earthy notes. Moderate to strong white pepper bitterness. M: Light to medium bodied with strong, persistent carbonation. Creamy with lingering bitterness, but fairly crisp finishing.  O: Very drinkable and refreshing. Could see having this on the beach.","  rDev Pours a clear golden coloration with a large, frothy head and visible carbonation. Smells of light doughy malt and quite vibrant, fruity and peppery yeast esters with a hint of citrus and grass coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, being heavily dominated by fruity/spicy yeast esters of mildly tart green apple, pear, apricot and pepper/clove, with some doughy, lightly sweet malt and lighter grassy, bitter hops, with just a hint of citrus and hay coming through as well. Finishes with a light tartness and bitterness and some green apple and citrus notes lingering in the aftertaste. Effervescent mouthfeel with a light/medium body and lively carbonation.  While this may not be all that complex, its beauty lies in its simplicity and flawless balance, with a lovely, expressive yeast culture as well. It actually feels somewhat more hoppy than I remember it, with a stronger bitterness and citrus notes. Not sure if my memory is playing tricks on me, but I suspect that this is quite a bit fresher than the bottle that I originally reviewed. Perhaps it's even a bit too hoppy for my personal taste and I think that I may prefer it with a bit of age on it, but it's nevertheless a beautiful example of the style that is a joy to drink and a classic for a reason.","  rDev 750 ml bottle dated April 2016 into pint glass. Let me preface this by admitting that a) I don't particularly like Belgian beers, and b) I found this in the fridge at the beach house and am drinking it because I respect beer. Even Belgian beer. The bottled date is somewhat off-putting, but my expectations are low, so..... Pours a slightly hazy golden-amber color with a coarse but surprisingly persistent off-white head. Initial impression is yeasty and sweet, with a slight banana overlay, strong fruits, and herbal notes. Mouthfeel was fairly light and refreshing; carbonation was fairly high. Finish was dry and clean. Well. A pleasant surprise. Despite all odds - including the bottling date and my prejudicial opinions - this was pretty damn good!  Perhaps this is yet another turning pint for me: I drank PBR exclusively for almost 40 years, then discovered IPAs. Then stouts. Then NEIPAs. Maybe now I've expanded my horizons to include Belgians.","  rDev Light to medium hazy gold color with beautiful white cap and lacing.  The aroma first hit me with the tart sharpness of wild cherries followed by ripe yellow fruit.  Taste on entry is far, far less tart and sharp as the scent indicated. Actually it's a very rounded and sophisticated presentation redolent of of ripe fruit that strikes me as more pear than banana but going in that general direction. Hoppiness is restrained and the fruit is backed by some spicy stuff such as clove. There's no hint of alcohol that I can detect.by  Medium texture with higher than average carbonation.  This beer manages to be simple and complex, very low key without upfront kick you in the teeth flavors, rather a more subtle approach that both impresses and pleases.","  rDev Look - hazy orange with a slight white head Smell - sweet orange very earthy and very Belgium  Taste - very earthy slight orange kind of bubblegummy  Feel - dry medium body with a creamy light carbonation Overall - so different fantastic farmhouse saison","  rDev Poured from 375ml bottle into glass. Stamped bottling information is 'L15171A 09:46:41'. Cloudy, pale gold colored body. Three finger fizzy head, settles to white cap. Spots of lacing. Aroma of bread, fresh hay, and fruity esters. Taste starts with the bread and hay, and goes to the sweet fruit. Good supporting carbonation, rather dry finish. Like smelling a late spring day after grass is cut down into hay.","  rDev Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium golden amber with a three finger white head that slowly dissipates to a thick cap with heavy lacing. Aroma of grainy malt, green apple, earthy and lightly white vinous. Flavor follows with grainy malt with light huskiness, apple, a hint of lemon, saison yeast, lightly earthy with light grassy and floral hops. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A classic saison from an ancient brewery, this is beautifully made and true to style. The grainy malt changes flavor over the taste, first with wheat and grain, then light fruit flavors and finally light hopping. Many years ago, after I gave up on saisons after having a few domestic ones that lean to tartness, I happened on a Dupont saison (don't remember the exact one, could have been this one) and my eyes were opened to the more traditional grain based, lightly funky versions of farmhouse ales. I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this one before, but it is great to revisit it. Really refreshing and flavorful.","  rDev Hazy pale yellow with a finger of relatively short-lived, bright white head.  A floral hop bouquet with soap and hint of fruity sweetness in the aroma.  More soap and floral hops up front in the taste. Muted cider-like sweetness mingles with a fairly strong earthy bitterness in the aftertaste.  Full bodied with a prickly, very highly carbonated feel that cleanses the palate.  The dull hoppy bitterness of this always catches me off guard. Not my favorite saison, but its standing as the classic in the style against which others are judged is still well-deserved.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a hazy golden color with a nice head. The head lasts for a good long while. Nose is yeasty and slightly fruity. Taste is on the dry side (which I desire tonight) and is even slightly bitter, although definitely thirst quenching.

A thin, weak mocha colored head forms on the beer momentarily before dissipating leaving no residual head behind. The head retention is not great, but otherwise its a nice looking beer. The aroma on this is interesting. Initially I got dark fruits when I poured it - lots of prune, raisin and even some port, along with a lovely vanilla note. As Im sitting here sipping it, I am getting much more of this umami, almost soy sauce aroma on this one. Now that I have got that on the brain I cannot shake it. That being said, there are some notes of roasted malts, barley, coffee, and vanilla. There is a certain sweetness to the beer that is clearly present on the nose.   The taste is very complex with a lot going on with this beer. So there are the notes of roasted malts, with notes of dark fruits - prunes, raisin, port wine - all coming in. There is a surprising level of sweetness to this beer that accentuates those fruity notes. As those move across the palate there are notes of fruity coffee, and some piney hops. The finish is where that umami/soy character on the nose comes in on the flavor. The finish then has that umami soy with a slight salty note - although that may just be my mind playing tricks on me from that soy flavor. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish as well with some light piney notes. Feel is medium bodied but rather viscous. Moderate carbonation.  Overall a complex and delicious Russian imperial stout from Three Floyds. I can certainly see why this beer earned the reputation it enjoys in the craft beer community. That being said, I can also see why it does not have the same cache it once had. Its an old school beer that just does not seem to fit in the current stout trends.

Aroma is roasty and toasty malts with hints of nutty, earthy and caramely malts. Toffee, molasses and chocolate aid in adding a little sweetness, with a little char bite at the finish. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, molasses and chocolate in a thick, syrupy bite that comes across just shy of being a dessert. Toasty, roasty and caramely malts add a little depth, along with a kiss of char towards the finish. It's dynamic, but balanced, easily transitioning between flavors. Mouth feel is dense and thick with a full, chewy texture. Overall, a chewy stout with just enough sweetness to counter the light chary bitterness. Dynamic and well calculated.

Somehow or another I had never had Dark Lord so I was excited to be able to give it a shot.  A little bit of oxidized due to the age but this actually held up better than I thought it was going to. I have heard lots of horror stories about this being straight soy sauce but I did not necessarily get that aspect. It probably would have been better 5 years ago but as it stands now this was still surprisingly tasty. Still thick and creamy and actually had some carbonation to it...  Glad I was able to check this one off of the list","  rDev Review #900  Man that’s just an incredible beer. Well worth the hype. And yet a little different from the other heavy imperial and Russian imperial stouts that I’ve had in the past. Definitely less chocolate and more dark stone fruit than I’m used to. This was the 2019 version - wax color maybe a dark maroon or crimson color? No date printed on bottle. Found this one online and tried to wait until a milestone beer - #900 - which was not easy. Pours a deep, dark, rich black opaque color with a little film of tan head and very spotty lingering lacing - it had to be a vigorous pour though. Smells incredible, dark rich roast coffee, caramel, dark stone fruit, brown sugar, malt, molasses, maybe a hint of bourbon. Just a hint though, definitely not like the BBA stouts. Taste follows the nose, incredibly well balanced and rich and complex. Seems like the darker fruit comprised of cherry and raisin, not cloyingly sweet although definitely a touch of sweetness in the foreground. Nice warming alcohol throughout, definitely a sipper but no burn at all. Stronger notes as the beer warmed. Excellent mouthfeel - syrupy and chewy, decadent, rich, smooth, coated the palate. Just a touch of carbonation but it was enough. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.","  rDev Note - FFFjunkie sent me this bottle. This review was written blind, and inserted here after the reveal. I had no clue till I unwrapped it. To see the pre reveal pic look in WBAYDN #2255 post 397.  Pours pitch black. Very thick pouring beer. For a 15% beer there was actually a bit of a tan/brown head, and it actually lasted a little bit. The bit of head dissipated to a thin ring around the glass Aroma - It's a deep, rich aroma. Lots of caramel on the nose. I also get dark fruit. A hint of chocolate. Slightly boozy smelling. Powerful nose, and a lot going on with it.  Taste - Like the nose it's a deep, rich stout, or RIS. Caramel, dark fruit, chocolate, toffee Feel - This is a 15% beer, but there's almost no burn, but has a slight warming feel. It is thick and smooth feeling.  Overall - This is a top notch beer.

Dark, brownish/purplish edging. Oily lacing on the glass. Smell and taste are both primarily sweet molasses and vanilla. Smell has almost maple notes underneath. Slight coffee and malt flavors have a subtle presence. Feel is where this beer seems to either rise or fall. After a couple of years, it’s got a big body and is oily and thick, but without the soy sauce feel or muddy drinking experience like fresher bottles seem to have. Some friends did an eight or ten year vertical (I missed it, otherwise I’d know the exact number), and the best rated bottle was four years old. Three years works well. It’s got plenty of taste and a pleasant alcohol burn and an exceptional mouthfeel. Lives up to the hype.","  rDev L: Black as pitch with a half-finger dark tan head and moderate retention and lacing.  S: Floors your nose with grain. This smells predominately like a bag of wheat or barley. Secondary aromas of soy sauce, cocoa, and molasses.  T: Follows the nose with much additional sweetness and some vanilla.  F: Smooth and coating. Some carbonation. No complaints.  O: One of my favorite stouts for its earthy originality. This one is in a league of it's own.","  rDev 2012 Batch. Refrigerated since release.

Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast flavors; with a solid hop/roast bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and extremely full body; with a very creamy, silky, velvety, and rich mouthfeel the is perfect; lightly slick/syrupy. Minimal sticky hops, chalky roast, or dryness. Minimal warmth of 15%, with zero booze lingering after the finish. Overall this is an insane flavored Russian imperial stout! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV, with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Insanely rich and complex; with perfect balance of malts, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and fruity yeast. This is the smoothest 15% stout I've ever had. Completely lived up to the original hype it had in the early years. A world class RIS.","  rDev I don't have much to say that hasn't been said, but this is based on the May 2018 release. Sticky and sweet, vinous, with subdued coffee and vanilla notes and a dry finish.","  rDev Black, thick, syrupy beer with a quickly fading head. No lacing. Chocolate, root beer and coffee nose.

Pours dark, opaque, with a half inch head of quickly dissipating darker foam and some spotty lacing. Aromas of malt, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, figs, some coffee and molasses, light coconut and smoke. Smells great. The taste also leads with the malt, then cocoa, vanilla, oak, caramel, raisins, figs, some coffee and chocolate, light molasses, a hint of anise. Very smooth for the ABV, a solid full body, well carbonated.  Great aroma, very good flavor, I certainly enjoyed it. Depending on the price offered, well worth a purchase.","  rDev Sweet and smoky.

Finally got around to doing this ‘14 - ‘17 Dark Lord vertical, below is a nice breakdown of each one in the order I tried them. It was a tight race between 2015 and 2016 as the best of the bunch. Averaged bumped to a 4.5.  [2013] Pours viscous, Black. Syrupy.  Sweet, dark fruit. No hints of soy. Rich, fudgy.  Roasty, sweet dark fruit . Hints of fudge. Predominantly sweet. Hints of metallic flavors.  Medium body, sticky  2014 Pours pitch black, syrupy, no head, tan thin lace.  Nose is very sweet, roasty, molasses. Dark fruit. Soy sauce finish.  Flavors match a lot of the nose characteristics. Sweet, dark chocolate, roasty coffee finish  Syrupy body, very sticky. Low carb, smooth finish.  2017 Pours dark brown, almost black, nice low head of brown foam, thin lace.  The nose is good on this. Roasty coffee, vanilla, slight stinging bitter molasses quality.

Thick and syrupy, very sticky. Not a bad body but a little too sticky and syrupy.","  rDev Finally was able to try after all of these years, can see how this was revolutionary in 2004 when first released, and still damn good today. The taste is incredible rich, and plenty sweet with the indian sugar, vanilla and chocolate combining to lead with coffee, roasted malt, and dark fruits, especially raisin, following. Very smooth, viscous and luxurious in feel. Smell does not have same depth, but has a cool sweet chocolate booziness that is very pleasant. The wife loved this one  Aging Note: Better after at least 1 year","  rDev This beer has been a Whale for me to get. I have wanted to try this beer now for 8 years. My dear Friend Dan gave this me for my 1000th beer. I am celebrating today of all days. My life is making a turning point and I finally hit the 1000 beer marker. Thank you so very much for this opportunity. Poured into my Surly glass at 47 degrees, I will allow this beer to warm a bit more. The pour on the beer was thick, like molasses. The head that formed was one finger dark tan head with fair retention. The beer is darker than the ace of spades and opaque. Nothing is going pierce this inky black beer. Some carbonation is visible from the side but the beer is darky abyss waiting to be discovered. Some lacing on the glass is left on the glass.   The Nose on this beer is huge, dark roasted malt, a touch of char, brown sugar, molasses, dark chocolate, soy sauce, wood, earthy, floral, caramel, dark roasted coffee, stone fruit, yeast, vanilla anise, and some ethanol notes.   The beer has a super dark roasted malt, cola note, vanilla, earthy, floral, dark caramel, earthy, dark roasted malt, vanilla, anise, stone fruit, yeast, dark chocolate, like an oatmeal note, and touch of char.   The mouthfeel is like anything I have ever had in a beer is velvety smooth, just the right amount of carbonation, super chewy, heavy body, and long sensual finish.   The beer is simply beautiful, well crafted, balanced, and hide the ABV so well. For a young beer 2017 it is a work of art. The balance in this beer is just ridiculous. Absolutely one of the best examples of a RIS","  rDev 2017 bottle share, it pours pitch black with a small brown head that faded slowly and left minimal spotty lacing. Mean looking stout, as expected. The beer looks were almost as impressive as the bottle art.  Smells of molasses, soy sauce, syrup, toffee, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, dark chocolate, smoked malts, peat moss, roasted malts and earthy notes. Rich, complex and full of deep chocolate and malty notes.  Flavor is everything I hoped for at this young stage: dark chocolate, roasted grains, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, soy sauce, rum or dark spirits, vanilla, Coca Cola, peat moss, brownie batter and light ashy notes. It's sweet, but for a young version this is phenomenal. Incredibly smooth and ridiculously easy to drink at this stage, it hides the ABV masterfully and will only get better with age. A world class beer and one of my white whales, happy to have tried this masterpiece.","  rDev My old neighbor got a 2014 vintage (blue wax) bottle from a work colleague and shared it with me and my other old neighbor. Very grateful to have the opportunity to try a dark lord....but was very disappointed. It poured an opaque dark with no head and no lace. The scent was decent with coffee and vanilla presence. The taste was extremely sweet and lactosy. Was tough to pick up any other flavor. Honestly....i would have dumped it had it not been such a rare beer. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with very subtle if any carbonation. Overall I'm glad I didn't have to wait in line or pay egregious entrance fee for this one.","  rDev 2014 bottle = 4.34 revised for 2018 bottle","  rDev 22 oz. bottle - 2017 vintage  Pours black with a creamy brown foam head.

Tastes like rich dark chocolate, sweet brown sugar, dark roasty coffee, vanilla, dark caramel, dark molasses, dark fruit, cherry, raisin, mild soy sauce, some smoky char, with leafy floral earthy herbal grassy pine.

Reviewing the 2017  L - Pitch black and super thick. No head but a small ring with no lacing.  S - Very sweet, dark, malty.  T - This is interesting unique. I understand why people say so sauce, but I won't go there. It's really sweet with lots of dark fruits and chocolate and malt. The barrel is wonderfully balanced.  M - This is like drinking velvet. This is one of the best mouthfeel of any beer It's better than KBS.   O - Like many old school, super hyped beers, this is really unique. It's a great flavor, almost a mix of Belgian dark fruits and BA stout.","  rDev Courtesy of @FFFjunkie's NBS BIF box. 2017 Vintage. Poured into 3 Floyd's Teku glass. It pours jet black. I held the glass to the sun and there were no hues. It has a full finger of creamy, khaki-colored head and extensive lacing. The nose features roasted malt, caramel, molasses, tobacco smoke, anise, and subtle dark fruit. Despite the subtlety of the fruit on the nose, the first thing I taste is ripe cherry, along with freshly brewed coffee, vanilla, oak, and molasses. The cherry is very sweet. There is a smoky, slightly spicy, bitter finish that is difficult to describe. This stout is creamy, almost chewy, with moderate carbonation, and the massive 15% ABV is remarkably well hidden. But it's dangerously potent. Sip this one carefully. I'm a great fan of the RIS style and I like to taste some dark fruit. This is probably the sweetest RIS I've ever tried. It's truly a dessert sipper. I'm really glad to have finally enjoyed this legendary stout."]},{"Name":"Tripel Karmeliet","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/202/656/","Brewery":"Brouwerij Bosteels","Style":"Tripel","Alcohol":8.40,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Tall, white head from a VERY gentle, drizzle down the side pour. Audible fizziness as I pour, almost like a soft drink. Very good retention leaving sticky lacing (and a nicely laced empty chalice). Slightly hazy golden body, heavily carbonated.  The aroma is not too strong, but sweet. Bubblegum, and a bit of banana.  The flavor brings the tastes promised by the aroma, sweet bubblegum and banana. The middle has very slight bittering, which does not last into the finish. Behind the already mentioned flavors is a lightly tart fruitiness, perhaps pear (hard to tell) along with a semi-sweet component - perhaps even vanilla - and floral. The finish is creamy and smooth, with an aftertaste of smoothness, maybe from the soft carbonation that is hard for me to describe, spreading out on the tongue. This aftertaste is exquisite!  The mouth feel is quite smooth (yeah, I keep using that word), with a gentle carbonation on my tongue. Moderate body.  Karmeliet is malty, smooth, and yet heavily carbonated with a huge creamy head, not very (if at all) spicy, several sweet components to the flavor without ever entering cloying territory and finishing only semi-sweet.

Thanks for the brief reprieve you Belgian wizards","  rDev Pours a clear, deep golden coloration with a large, fluffy head and visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy and caramelly malt and citrus zest, with estery hints of green apple and clove as well. Taste is an excellent balance of doughy, slightly grainy and caramelly malt, hoppy citrus notes and fruity/spicy yeast esters of green apple, banana, clove and peppery spice. finishes with a medium sweetness and some caramel malt, citrus zest and peppery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Effervescent mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium/strong carbonation.  This makes for quite a hoppy Tripel with some distinct, floral and zesty citrus notes in addition to those fruity and spicy yeast esters, with the spice standing out as well. There really is an excellent balance of sweet malt, zesty hops and fruity/spicy yeast to this, making for a brew that feels rich and refreshing, complex and easy-drinking at the same time, while the ABV is hardly noticeable as well and there really is a fantastic, full and effervescent mouthfeel to this. Overall, this makes for a great Tripel that is perhaps a bit more hoppy than most, but balanced so well that it really makes for an exceptionally pleasant drinking experience.","  rDev This beer pours a bit of a murky golden, blonde color. The head is 2 finger, white, fluffy, and frothy, however, there's almost no lacing on the glass as it dissipates.  The nose, well, maybe I'm weird, ok, I know I am, but it reminds me of a hefe. I get a malty, bread, biscuit aroma, with some banana and cloves? There's also a slight, wild, funky, floral aroma, as well.  Taste - Am I drinking a hefe? I get the hefe flavors here. I get banana, I get cloves. I get a wild funky flavor as well. A bit earthy, a bit floral. This is confusing me a lot.  This body is pretty good. Full, and good for the ABV.  I like this beer, but if you told me it was a hefe, all be it, a strong one, I'd believe you. Good, but confusing me.","  rDev Smashing this Tripel like Ty Cobb is up to bat.

Poured a cloudy orange color with over two inches of white head that had very good retention and light-moderate lacing.  The aroma hits all the expected notes; nice earthy grains, soft floral hops, and a big hit of yeast featuring spice, fruit, and more flowery notes.  Same on the tongue, just more expended, bolder, and more fully developed.  The body was medium-ish, smooth, and had a spicy, dry finish.  Drinkability was excellent, I don't think I could get bored with this beer.  Overall, a classic for a reason. Among the best of its style, a must drink for every beer lover.","  rDev 330 mL bottle. Pours clear golden with a huge white head and little volcanoes of bubbles persist. Smells banana, apple, fruit sweetness, and a tinge of white pepper. Tastes dry, a little citrusy, with some sweet banana, spicy clove and warming earthy spiciness. Dries out with a snappy and bitter back end. High carbonation. This is better than I could have imagined and, at least from memory, the best Tripel I've had.","  rDev Lightly hazy straw in color with a huge, foamy white head from the effervescent carbonation. Lengthy retention with copious sheets of lacing. The aroma smells like lemon zest, green banana, soda crackers, straw, wildflowers and pie spices. The flavor is lemon zest, green banana, soda crackers, mead, straw, clover, vanilla, white pepper, and a hint of clove. Medium feel, highly carbonated, feels light for its abv but not thin. Surprisingly crisp and clean for its suggestions of sweetness. A slight rounded slickness due to the oats, no doubt.  A unique and excellent tripel. Very floral and noticeably hoppy, creamy and smooth.","  rDev 330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. Brewed by Bosteels. ABV is 8.4%.

The flavour is also spicy and yeasty with some fruit, notes of white kandij sugar, but the sweetness is not too much. Moderate hops in the finish.","  rDev Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a proper glass chalice. Bit of a gusher upon opening the bottle. Slightly hazy light golden hue, with a couple of fingers of soft white head that settled to a spotty cap within a minute or so.

Very sweet apple flavor. But some lighter fruit notes of pear and white grape. Golden raisin.   Feel: Medium - high level of carbonation. Very light bodied and easy drinking for an 8.5% beer with just a hint of warmth.  Overall: Very enjoyable.

I let this sit for a year, and the payoff is a milder, smoother experience...","  I love it when I grab a beer off the shelf, not thinking much of it, just grabbing it cause it looked interesting/nice/I-liked-the-wording/etc and then it turns out to be something oh so special...  This was such a great find, I just wish I could remember where I purchased it from. Anyway, it looks gorgeous in the glass with nice yellow and orange colorations, it has a decent head (though thin), and no lacing. The smell is what actually got me hooked. It was unique. I haven't come across a fruity smelling beer that was just that - fruity smelling with a hint of sweetness that tingled my toes. Mouthfeel was carbonated but so crisp, so juicy on the tongue that I overlooked the carbonation. The juiciness translated perfectly to the taste and blended well with the high ABV. Though I could still pull out the alcohol it didn't overpower the rest of the fruity and even tangy nature of the beer. Overall, this is a very well made beer, one of the better offerings from its stated style.","  rDev Brouwerij Bosteels  Tripel Karmeliet  75 CL green glass bottle, corked &amp; caged, seemingly without freshness dating unless the  26-17  on the cork means something $10.99 @ Wegmans, King of Prussia, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: It's been quite some time since I've enjoyed a Tripel Karmeliet. Well, at least properly. I recall having it at a pub in Salzburg, Austria with my wife in 2016 (?). I ordered it for her but she wasn't fond of it so I finished it off, but only after having already had several beers of my own! Anyway, it's poured a just slightly hazy yellow gold body beneath a massive head of bright white foam that I had to let settle before I could get it back to a three finger thick cap. Plenty of fine bubbles can be seen racing towards the surface. The aroma is something special. It's sweetish with malt and softly fruity, but also softly herbal, floral, earthy and spicy. It's fresh, and inviting. The flavor follows with sweet malt that's grainy, some distinctly spicy hops, and yeasty notes of banana and ripe apricot. The head at this point has dropped but it maintains a creamy cap, and arms and branches of lacing reach up along the sides of the glass. It's interesting in that it seems light in body and yet it has a dextrinous feel to it. Back to the flavor, I'm not finding the wheat or the oats (it's brewed with barley, wheat and oats, all of which are used in both their raw and malted forms), but it doesn't seem like just barley. There's some richness to the malt but it's not full, and although it's sweetish it's not sweet. I think that maybe the banana and vanilla from the yeast make it seem a little sweeter than it really is, but at the same time it's not a very bitter beer either. No, you could certainly plow through a few of these if you wanted to, only to have the alcohol hit you in the end. It's 8.4% abv which isn't really that strong in terms of beers these days, and yet that's still pretty strong. Fortunately the alcohol never shows, which is fantastic. It finishes mostly dry, with whatever residual sweet malt that's there fading quickly, and it's fairly lemony and a bit herbal. I've noted that the mouthfeel feels light and yet kind of dextrinous at the same time, and maybe that has something to do with the effervescent, natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. That's something that you can't really get on draught in my opinion. It gives a light bristle to the tongue which then turns to a caress, and then finally, if you haven't swallowed it yet, it becomes more airy and pillowy. It's beautifully done and has a real elegance to it, as does its flavor and aroma. Ahh, it just occurred to me, the mouthfeel might have something to do with the use of oats!  Review# 6,362","  rDev L- Darker side of straw coloured, very light clouding, pours with vast white head [I suggest you pour VEEERY slowly, or you might be hanging around!] that slowly recedes but this beer even 1/2 way through drinking still has good ongoing carbonation.

M- Heavy ABV%, and yet still refreshing, perhaps from the spicy edge. Not in the slightest OTT nor cloying. O- It's a pretty astonishing beer; how it so discretely has you drinking an 8.4%ABV without realising it's that high is a rare thing. It's lovely, shame it costs £3 a bottle [330ml) from Waitrose London!  ps.

There is something very special about it.","  rDev Bottled on 6/23/17  Smooth, earthy bubble gum backed by a light clove spice and refreshing bits of fruit shrouded in a fairly robust, complex finish.

Different than most tripels and that's why I think I enjoyed it a bunch. Pronounced sweetness and yest character but it isn't a spice bomb like many others.

Pours a light brown with very little head (or maybe the head was poured off - the pint glass was very full when it arrived at the table). Aroma and taste feature biscuity malt and some light coffee and chocolate. Very little hops. Mouthfeel is average carbonation and kind of thin, but then again this is 4.4% so that's not surprising. Overall it's a solid and tasty bock.","  rDev 16oz can stamped 092919 OK+ poured into a becher glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on can. The beer pours bright dark amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves no lacing. The aroma reveals no trace of malt, only yeast and an earthy aroma. The taste reveals some toasted malt with a slight vegetable corn aftertaste. Medium bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin plus bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, not a Bock. It's a not great AAL with a touch of toasted malt and too many off flavors.","  rDev Nice brew. Served on tap in a 20 oz shaker pint. Dark brown in color with swirls of khaki foam floating on top.

Overall...it's OK.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  0324190K+ 02:58:45   Appearance: It has a brown body with very good clarity. There is a medium-sized fluffy light tan head that has good retention and lacing.  Aroma: The beer has hints of what smells like noble hops with just a bit of a spicy grassy note. There is a light nutty aroma to the beer and just a hint of caramel.  Taste: There is a slightly nutty flavor to the beer up front and it joins a lightly toasted bread flavor. There is just a touch of toffee sweetness to the beer. There is also a bit of a metallic flavor to the beer but it isn't strong.  Mouthfeel: It is a very clean and easy to drink beer. It is smooth in the middle and crisp at the end.  Overall: The beer is very enjoyable to drink but it tends to miss some of the robustness that competing beers have. The lighter presence of aroma and flavor don't make it less enjoyable to drink though. I would recommend it to people looking for a malty lager for an event or a get-together. i would drink it again.","  Reviewing as part of BJCP training. This is listed as an example for 2C. International Dark Lager, yet it calls itself a Bock, so we'll see. Canned 11/24/18  Pours a crystal clear auburn-amber-brown color, the nice foamy head hits a finger but fades at a fair pace, a bit of lacing  Nose brings some mild toasted darker malts, a little biscuity, little toffee and raw molasses like note, a mild toasted sweet corn notes which are acceptable for the style, and a little yeasty almost sulfury like thing  Taste fair malty flavor, a fair sweetness as well, biscuity toffee and quite toasty, mild bread crust, a touch of caramel and maybe molasses like notes, a touch of herbal spicy hops in the background with very mild bitterness, a touch of that sulfury like mineral lager notes are there as well, mild sticky finish I think there are more unfermentables than should be for the style, lingering mild bitterness and minerality, sticky malts too  Mouth is medium to a little lighter bod, a little smoothness and medium to higher carbonation  Overall not great, but not too bad, considering this halfway between International Dark Lager, and Dunkles Bock, it has characters of both, yet there are some not so pleasant characters as well. Again not sure why this is a specific example of the style for BJCP, it seems like this is not quite within ranges for the style at all. I'll have to see if I can get another example.","  rDev Shiner Bock brewed by Spoetzl Brewery / Shiner, with an ABV of 4.40% This German Bock pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer. The color is a nice light brown color , almost a golden copper like color, with a small white head. The head to this brew goes away fast. There is also some nice spotty lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The lacing reminds me a soapy bubbles. The smell of this Bock is sweet with lots of grains and malts. A nice amount of mirror hop bitterness in the smell as well. So far this is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up a slight roasted sweetness, mixed with grains an malts. The body of the Shiner Bock is a light medium, this is a very easy drinking brew. This brew would go nice with an occasion, lunch, dinner, party. The mouth feel of Shiner Bock is Bold, Rich, Sweet, Smooth, Clean, and Refreshing.

Rather simplistic bock.","  rDev This is not the most fancy of beer nor is it particularly complex, but it's an easily drinkable bock and a nice accompaniment to food. Fairly malty, with perhaps not a great deal of bitterness but other wise an OK drink.","  rDev Deep red amber color,medium carbonation.

Light caramel maltiness offsetting light bitterness. More complex on the third review.  M: Medium bodied with light carbonation.  O: I had this when I was in Dallas and I didn't care for it, but wanted to given it a second try. I was under-impressed by the second go, although now have some doubts about cleanliness of the tap. The bottled (and well refrigerated) final attempt was substantially higher quality and more consistent with a reasonably well made Bock, albeit not a superior one. I can only conclude that this is highly sensitive to transportation and storage.

As the head receded, some crackery malts appeared. Bit of lemony tartness. Later, the yeasty notes continued to subside and the malt presence intensified.  The flavor profile was quite hoppy for the style. Like in the aroma, crisp, dry, powdery yeasty notes came through strong. Some crackery malts were noticeable up front. Tart lemon notes appeared in the center and on the back end. The beer finished with more lemon, bitter lemon peel and a crisp, peppery hoppiness.  Fantastic light and fluffy mouthfeel. The liquid contained a super fine, fairly zippy effervescence that turned pillowy soft and plush on the palate.  Like most of Sierra Nevada’s offerings, Summerfest is a hop-forward take on a classic style.

The taste is delicate and nuanced with a nice pils malt husk/grain cracker like malt, mild-moderate bitterness and a clean finish. No off flavors.  This is one of my favorite beers. Of course when I first got into craft beers, it was all about big rich flavors...Dopplebocks, Rauchbiers, Russian Imperial stouts, DIPA's, barleywines.

Medium bodied and almost a creamy smooth mouth-feel, carbonation is as it should be. Low to moderate bitterness for an IPA and the finish is short. With a lower ABV could potentially be a sessioner. Good beer, enjoyed it.","  rDev 12oz can poured into a pint glass. A lot of citrusy hops on the nose along with a fairly balanced taste with a moderate hop bite in the finish. Not a bad IPA.","  rDev Poured into a custom shaped grip glass: color is gold, clear, minor carbonation, head is white, fine to small bubbles, head lingers very well with some good lacing on the glass.  Smell is a little sweet, some more earthy/herbal hops less pine/citrus. Taste is the least pleasant aspect of this ale: sweetness with the yeast/hop combo is off compared to many other IPAs in terms of flavor. I can't pinpoint it but its seems like a yeast byproduct or a malt flavor that carries through, not quite buttery but in that regard.  Mouthfeel is moderate, crisp, a bit drying but the off flavor lingers.  Overall a beer that is disappointing - I like the rebel rouser but this flavor profile is just slightly unbalanced to me.","  rDev ** 01/17/15 On tap at chili’s. Better than the cold snap  AROMA: is citrus pine, hops. Not strong.  LOOK: Clear pilsner Color. TASTE: turpentine with a hint of lemon. FEEL: Light body, but on par for a mass produced IPA.  **","  rDev A 355ml bottle with a notched best before date of March 2018. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.  Appearance: A nice and clear dark orange copper colour with an almost two finger white head with good retention while leaving lots of nice lacing.  Aroma: Sweet caramel and biscuit malt with hints of grapefruit and pine.  Taste: Very malty caramel and biscuit, with light pine and grapefruit and some lasting bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.  Overall: Not bad, but too malty an IPA for my liking. Apparently the new version of the Rebel IPA they made in 2017 is more tropical fruity and I feel that may be more my thing.","  rDev 12oz can BB July 2017 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 6.5% ABV 45 IBU (new formula from the pack of rebels 12 pack.) The beer is golden copper in color with thick off white head and some lacing. Aroma is minimal of fruity hops and caramel malt. Taste is subdued also with some caramel malt sweetness and vague hop flavor mingled together. Doesn't feel like 45 IBU to me at all. Mouthfeel is above average with soft feel, good carbonation and and a little oil from hops. It still manages to finish mostly dry. Overall, good. This is really more of a pale ale and pretty tasty.","  rDev 355 mL bottle from a six-pack purchased at the LCBO. Best before Jun 2017 and served slightly chilled. Apparently this brew has seen a recipe/label change within the last couple of months... but this particular sixer features labels identical to the one pictured above - and thus, I figure it's most likely old stock from before the switchover.  Pours a lightly hazy golden-blonde colour, with one finger of loose, soapy white head seated atop. Average retention; it melts down over the next five minutes or so, leaving behind a full, smooth coating of sticky lace as it recedes. The only other eventual remnant is a modest-sized collar of froth - looks fine by me. The aroma is about what you'd expect from such a C-hop-heavy IPA - muddled orange, grapefruit skin and lemon pith, as well as a good dose of earthy, floral, somewhat resiny notes. Caramelized sugar is also noted, along with some generic pale malt sweetness.  The flavours follow after the nose - featuring a steady backing of bready pale malts and caramel sweetness, overlapping with plenty of West Coast-style hopping. Citrusy grapefruit and orange rind figure in quite strongly, with a pointed note of flowery/floral bitterness lasting through to the finish, which is resiny and earthy. Moderately bitter aftertaste that fades in a matter of seconds; off-dry. Medium-bodied, with middling carbonation levels that feel about right - smooth, but not overly soft, imparting a gentle prickling sensation with each sip. Drinkability is fair, but I am not real big on this one's floral elements.  Final Grade: 3.67, a B grade. Samuel Adams' Rebel IPA is a passable effort, but I would consider it neither unique nor particularly memorable as an IPA. Like most of this brewery's products, the scaffolding for a decent beer is both present and fairly sturdy, but beyond that? It simply leaves too much to be desired, never going  above and beyond  the expectations I have for a modern, hoppy pale ale. I would not call this a bad beer, but there's no way I'd call it a great one, either. It's decidedly middle-of-the-road, and for that reason I don't think I can give this beer anything more than a cursory, ambivalent sort of recommendation. Guess I'll have to try the new recipe at some point to see if it has improved any.","  rDev Golden yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured from a can with a huge, soapy foamy, bright white head with good retention. Medium light tropical citrus aromas with light pine notes and a medium malty backbone. Medium bodied with a light creamy smooth feel and medium light carbonation. Pleasant warm feel from the middle to the end. Medium spicy hop flavors up front with medium light ruoe citrus beneath. Medium hop bitterness through the middle followed by citrus notes to the end. Solid malty backbone. Finished semi dry with a light lingering spicy bitterness with light pine notes. Very drinkable with pleasant hop character. Not terribly complex, but a solid IPA.","  rDev On tap in a pint glass. A clear golden yellow with a one-finger white head. Great lacing in the glass. Not much aroma-some faint citrus and pine notes. The taste was a bit muddled with predominant bitter grapefruit with some piney notes. A bready malt presence and a clean dry finish. Medium bodied and carbed nicely.","  rDev Pours a deep gold/pale amber producing 2 fingers of frothy, off-white, shortlived, head that leaves webs, streaks &amp; motes of lace. Aroma is thin but made up of caramel malt, floral, grapefruit &amp; pine hop notes. Taste is floral, citrus (orange &amp; tangerine) &amp; pineapple, caramel malt sweetness heaviest mid-sip through the finish but transitions to a bitter finish &amp; an increasingly bitter aftertaste. Taste is nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied moderate carbonation smooth but average. If the Boston Beer Co. was attempting to produce something with West Coast IPA character I think they succeeded but it is pushing it to say that it is a good example.","  Appearance: Straw gold colored glass shows excellent clarity but struggles to hold a thin white head of foam that gives up little lacing. Looks a little thin.  Aroma: Grapefruit citric west coast hops seem on target, heavy enough to cover most of the malt base but a little sweetness comes through. Firm but not quite full nose.  Taste: Little more sweetness comes out that bring the hop levels down to somewhat pedestrian levels. What is there is good, but there's not enough here in base or hops to get me excited. Mild soapy note in the finish.   Mouthfeel: Bit oily, small prickly of carbonation comes across as fairly low, body is medium light.  Overall: About 65% of what I want this beer to be. Needs to turn up the volume across the board, kind of comes across as a full American Pale Ale, a little light for an IPA.","  rDev On tap at TGI Fridays. Pours a straw-colored, amber hue with minimal frothing. Subtle nuances of pine and citrus on both the nose and tongue. Slight hints of pine, although barely noticeable. Grapefruit thrown into the mix as well.","  rDev L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a golden yellow color and a clear texture. There was half inch of foamy head that lasted a short amount of time. Excellent lacing.  S: An average aroma of light hops, fruit, and a grainy quality.  T: Tasted of a fair amount of hops, a hint of citrus (grapefruit) that's most apparent in the finish, pine notes, sweet malt, and previously mentioned grainy quality. A decent enough flavor, but it isn't pushed far enough. The hops content, which is most obvious in the bitter aftertaste, isn't as balanced with the citrus and pine as it should be.   F: A fair shot of carbonation with a mostly dry finish. Light-bodied.  O: Rebel IPA is certainly not the worst IPA I've ever tried, but it definitely doesn't distinguish itself. Drinkable, if there's nothing else around.","  rDev So with all the potentially great IPAs in the house I pull out a Sam Adams. What’s wrong with me? Not enough room here. 12 oz. can.   The pour makes clear this comes from the other coast tradition: lots of bubbles, pale orange, clear. Not matter how much air I process, I can get nothing via the nose. Seriously. That must be some kind of record.   Rebel IPA makes me think Sam has something going here. Intense bitterness is the highlight here - none of this fruit-laden, Garden of Eden, East Coast nonsense for the Rebel. 93 MPH of bitterness is barely restrained by slivers of citrus, pine, grapefruit rind, &amp; sweet, bready malts. Pine sticks around as it warms. Jagged &amp; drinkable.   Put this in an Alchemist shaker &amp; I bet the score would go up a half point. Good, solid IPA.","  rDev Clear golden ale. Thin but long lasting head. Mild aroma of citrus hops and pine. Taste reflects the aroma. Quite tannic and astringent. A little malt comes through. Medium bodied.

White head; no lace.   Sweet peach nose.   Thin mouthfeel.   Sweet effervescent peach delight. Great summer delight-almost like champagne.","  rDev Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a thin-walled glass goblet. Clear amber color, with a couple of fingers of white head. Good head retention, not much lacing. The tartness is understated, as is the peach flavor. Aromas and flavors of light malt, yeast, peach, and green apple. Very low bitterness, and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, this is very refreshing and lip-smackingly good. It would make an approachable choice for someone looking to get into sours.","  rDev This beer pours a pale yellow with an average head. The aroma features strong, dusty wheat malt notes, along with sour peach and underripe apricot, cheese rind, and a hint of basil. The flavor is mild with a solid but not puckering amount of sourness, with a subtle level of fairly underripe peach, and that hint of romano cheese rind on the back. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy.

Average to limited lacing. - Clean. Malty with clear notes of soft peach and a suggestion of acidity. - Clean. Tart, balanced by sweetish grainy malt and then livened by soft peach. Very little bitterness but still with a dry, mildly acidic finish. - Light body leaning towards medium-light with a gently effervescent and bristling bite due at least in part to the acidity.  So to the  overall . Unlike many Berliner-weisse-style beers this one is very clean. There are no off-flavors and not too much mineral qualities or anything like that. And unlike many breweries that add fruit to them there's just a light pleasant note of the peach here that adds to the beer rather than it being a fruit beer that happens to have a Berliner Weiss base. It's easy to drink despite its tartness, and quite refreshing. It doesn't linger for long, and certainly isn't sticky, and it's perfect for summer. Very nice. Certainly worth trying. Review# 6,065","  rDev ** 06/05/18 Dogfish Head lunch at Monks. **","  rDev The beer pours a pale straw color, with a white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is a clean and simple balance between a light funky sour note and a bright peach background note, with neither overpowering the other. Tastes of bright and moderate acidity that blends perfectly with the peach juice. Malt flavor is almost non existent, but there is a low honey-like malt note. The finish is semi-dry, with a lingering sour funk and light mouthfeel.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a thin white ring. Medium carbonation. Thin body. Crisp, tart, and light taste. Flavor of sour peaches. Dry finish.","  rDev Hold orange color. Carbonation is light,can feel it but doesn't influence feel too much. Aroma is wheat and peaches but not too strong,fake,or floral from the peaches. A slight tart sour finish. Other than a bit of wheat it reminded me of a sour with just a touch of peach.and like advertised it didn't come off syrupy,just a light touch of natural peach","  rDev Undated bottle into pint glass. Pours a hazy light gold with almost no head. Initial impression is peachy tartness. Kinda like liquid SweeTarts candy. Mouthfeel is medium; carbonation is on the light side. Despite the light carbonation, it's still quite refreshing. Very fruity for my taste though. My ratings reflect my personal preferences, not the quality of the beer.","  rDev As the eradication of the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody continues, the next brewery's horizontal to be conducted is that of DFH. Interestingly, this one was a recent purchase at my former place of employment, Molly's Carryout. I have no idea how they came up with a vintage bottle, but it does not really matter.  From the bottle:  Ale brewed with peach juice ;  Festina Peche is a neo-Berliner style Weisse. Unique, tart and refreshing, this brew is so down with the dog days of summer. ;  Dogfish Seasonal Art Series 6th Annual Ltd. Edition 2014 Jermaine Rogers .  I Pop!ped the cap and began a very gentle pour in keeping with my newest self-imposed standard. There was no need for an in-glass swirl since there was a LOT of foaming action going on. It finally created just under three fingers of foamy, fizzy, bone-white head with better retention than I actually expected to occur. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = &gt; 2, &lt; 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an undeniable tartness that immediately caused my lips to pucker, but accompanied by a peach sweetness which was easy to identify. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, just a step or two above watery. It was initially quite tart, but the sweetness of the peach began to creep into the picture and smooth things out. I was reminded of those gummy sour peach candies with the coarse sugar that also start vey tart and become slightly sweet. Finish was tart and dry and I can see how this would be refreshing on a hot, humid summer's day. I will probably revisit it when this year's batch is released. For now, I am anxious to get rid of that creepy-looking raccoon on the label ...","  rDev 12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass at Agora in Houston (drank on August 15, 2016)  L: pale yellow, very light, about 75% clear with slight mistiness; pushes up almost 2-inch head of white fluffy foam that dissipates quickly; little sticking, no lacing  S: lemon tartness, grain ,sour grain, tart peaches; as it warms, the peach aroma sweetens into peach pie with some bread malt  T: lemon-peach mix, tart up front and sweeter on the back end; as it warms, has just a hint of earthy lemon peel and brett sourness, though still very clean and tart  F: solid all around, light and crisp  O: perfect starter kit for the sours novice; the peach tastes a bit like sugary syrup but the base brew is still good","  rDev I haven't had much luck with Dogfish Head, until today...  Though the look of the brew and it's smell were underwhelming, the rest that this little gem has to offer was impressive. The feel was carbonated, but due to the peach flavoring it had more of a tingling feeling than just the normal carbonation - it was probably the first beer that was as carbonated as this one that I enjoyed quite a bit. The taste was tart and slightly sweet - perfectly mixed actually. Overall, I enjoyed partaking the brew even though I wasn't impressed at how it looked or smelled.","  rDev Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a tumbler pint.  The beer was a light, golden straw color and I was surprised to find it to be extremely clear. The head was lively but very short-lived. Big, soapy bubbles the fell almost immediately as expected for a Berliner Weissbier.  The aroma - very faint. There was an earthiness and mild funky note, sour peach, and a little yeasty with a bit of the herbal/grassy notes going on.  The taste was surprising based on the aroma. The initial taste was moderately sour that evolved into a decently strong peach flavor (bordering on apricot). There is just enough malt on the back of the swallow to provide a touch of sweetness and enough bitterness to offset the initial sour impact. The malt taste isn't clear - it is just there - but gives enough balance. There is a light herbal/green hay note as well.  The carbonation was lively enough to offset the  clingy  tendency of the beer. It had the potential to become stick/sweet but it never really did. Enough bitter and tartness to offset, I think. It ends up being a bit dry, and I get the impression of eating fruit with the way the flavor progresses.  Overall, this beer fits within the style although it lacks in the typical citrus notes. Being a peach version, that seems OK. This one doesn't smack you in the mouth with the tartness - it is more soft and generally pleasing. It is a decently refreshing, quite flavorful beer that I would drink again.","  rDev Artwork: A fairly cutesy label depicting what appears to be a smiling peach/sun creature rising above a field of peaches, barley and various critters. Kinda like it.  Appearance: Head that lasts a total of 5-seconds (pour time included) which is typical of US-made Berliners (not that I've had anything else). Hardly any signs of carbonation. Hazy yellow.  Nose: Very metallicy. No detectable peach or other fruit. None of the lactic sourness of most Berliners. In general I do not find the nose to be too appetizing.   Taste: Not as tart as most Berliners. Very tasty otherwise. Peach barely detectable. Little in the way of complexity. Fairly crisp.   Mouthfeel: Medium body. Very little carbonation.  Overall: Very refreshing but that's about it. Would drink again if found for cheap.","  rDev My first try of this beer was not pleasant. However, when I looked in the basement and saw a 2 year old bottle, I thought I would try it again. I found it acceptable, but not outstanding. Hazy with a nice head and a bit of peach in the nose and mouth.","  rDev 6/20....pours a dirty gold with white foam. Clingy, but not to a fault. Light peachy nose. Taste is a peach tart - the berliner style is bolstered by the fruit. All wrapped around a malty sour. Very good. Nice seasonal summer beer.","  rDev Pours - Cloudy yellow color with decent white head that dissipates to just a white ring of bubbles.  Smell - Funky hay and straw, little bit of wheat I am getting no peach.  Taste - From a taste stand point still just a hint of peach, lots of tart lemon zest and wheat nice flavor wish it had more peach.  Feel - Light body pretty dry  Overall - I liked this beer wish it had more peach but I do like this style.","  rDev Pale cloudy gold beer with a bright white head that clings to the edges. Smells funky with peaches and crackers. There is also a nice white wine hint. The taste is fresh peach with some sour notes. Really nice beer.","  rDev When you think about it, Berliner Weiss provides the opportunity for beer to have as many flavors as, say, an ice or sorbet. Traditionally, Berliners used raspberry or woodruff. So, why not peach? And after that, why not any fruit or concoction of flowers and herbs like woodruff. Think of the possibilities !  As for the peach, Festina Peche was good enough to open my eyes. A sour, to be sure. A soft wheat also.  But now the summer season has much greater variety of syrups that can be added to a Berliner Weiss.... at least that is my theory.","  rDev Yellow with haze, head barely forms and doesn't stay for long. There's a peach like whiff of aroma, lemon.  Mildly sweet, grist full, no bitterness. More lemon and peach notes. Wheat fully apparent. One of the better DFH beers and formats out there.  EDIT: Getting to like this beer a little more. Prior score 3/3.5/3.5/3.75/3.5. Definitely understanding the appearance moreso, the peach note hits nicer now too.","  rDev Not a fan of the Peche....it poured a hazy pale yellow with white head that did not lace much. The scent and taste was white winey. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with subtle carbonation. Overall it was not my fav....perhaps had it been in the summer I might be more taken to it.","  rDev Pale yellow, mostly transparent, with absolutely no head beyond a quick fizzy beginning pour, sort of like a light soda.  Lemon and monterrey cheese funk on nose.  Peach forward flavor, with yeasty and malty lager undertones.  Tangy, bright, crisp, and something similar to effervescent, nearing champagne territory.","  rDev A - Pours a clear straw color with a thick creamy white head and moderate carbonation.  S - Earthy straw, peaches, some tart funk.  T - Some tart and tangy peach, white grapes, and a lingering sugar tart finish. The sugar from the fruit eventually forms a sweet coating on the back of the tongue that makes it a little too cloying at times.  M - Very crisp, sprightly carbonation on the tongue, extremely dry finish.  O - Crisp, refreshing, and great for those hot summer days (that are long since gone at the time of this review).","  rDev This is a very good Berliner, which is one of my favorite styles, nice and tart with just a little fruit to keep up the sweetness. It's not overbearingly sour, which makes it a great entry level sour.","  rDev Poured into a Weizen glass. Hazy pale straw color with a bright white head. Muted wheat and yeast aroma with a hint of sour and peach. The taste was surprisingly great, with elements of tart sour, peach and wheat all working together in good balance. Clean finish. Less sour than most Berliners that I have had - more in line with a Gose, but very refreshing."]},{"Name":"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17981/47022/","Brewery":"Cigar City Brewing","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":10.20,"Score":100.0,"Comments":["  rDev 2020  Amalie Arena  edition...large capped bottle.

Poured a black body with minimal khaki head and this tiny khaki lace ring that stuck around. The aroma comes across as spicy, the cinnamon and chilies grabbing the nose, with minor chocolate sweetness underneath the spice. Smooth, silky, has some sticky sweetness despite how easy it is to drink. Chili and cinnamon balance with chocolate and vanilla, just enough booze for a complementary finish, and even mild notes of dark fruits like figs (not so much plum).

Otherwise I've found many more balanced brews in the category, such as Coffee Cinnamon Bourbon Abominable by Fremont. Hunahpu is worthy of a try and of forming your own opinion, but you may also not find it up to the hype.","  rDev 2016 vintage (released 3/12/16); drank 5/21/16 @ Yuss Haus Mach II.   Black appearance.   A violent pour yielded a big, noisy dark khaki head; nice lace.   Orange citrus &amp; milk chocolate notes in the nose; Black IPA vibes!!   Thick, sticky mouthfeel.   Orange citrus &amp; rich milk chocolate flavors up front; cinnamon notes on the finish. Booze heat notes emerged as this warmed.   Unique, complex &amp; tasty. Nice!","  rDev I finally landed this whale. I have wanted to drink this beer for the last five years. I am looking forward to this review. I popped the top off and a hiss emitted. The beer is 52 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer just glugged out of the bottle as I poured it into the glass. This thick beer produced a two finger dark brown head. The retention on the head is phenomenal. The head dissipated slowly and left no lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 nearly black. The beer is opaque.   The initial aroma I got from the beer is dark roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, and dark chocolate. Next, I smell vanilla, molasses, chili, raisins, bready, char, and leather. The beer has this earthy garden aroma that I get on the backend.   Holy Moly! The flavors in the beer are dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, chilis, vanilla, molasses, raisins, anise, char, leather, earthiness, smokiness, char, bready, and a vegetal note.   The mouthfeel of the beer is chewy and dry.   The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and a full finish.   What an incredible beer. Knowing this beer being is not barreled aged is utterly amazing. The harmony in the beer is like a fine-tuned instrument. Beers like this are why I love Imperial Stouts.","  rDev This pours onyx black with the darkest brown head I’ve ever seen on a beer. The nose has the chilies up front, but there’s a mother lode of other aromas - cocoa, cinnamon, char, vanilla, literally a plethora of notes that blend perfectly.  And they blend better on the taste, if that’s possible. I get the chilies first, probably because I love spicy flavors, and the spice has some bite, but the cocoa and vanilla flavors balance the heat, and then the cinnamon lends a churro quality to this that elevates it to the top of the world-class quadrant. Simply magnificent, IMHO.","  rDev Dark, thick beer with darkest, thickest head I've ever seen. Aromas include coffee, chocolate, molasses, dark malt and done fruitiness which is reminiscent of raspberries or cherries. The taste is all that but amplified. There is cinnamon in the flavor I did not detect in aroma. This is a thick, chewy, decadent beer. Really amazing.  Just wish it had a little more spiciness.","  rDev In a snifter, at nearly room temperature, the beer was black with a one-finger cinnamon colored head. Aroma of chocolate, cinnamon, and pepper. The taste is where this beer shines. Intense dark chocolate. Cinnamon. The chilis are very noticeable, but are complementary and not intrusive. This is a wonderful big, bold beer. It more than lives up to its hype.","  rDev 22oz bottle at share. What a way to wash that previous stout out of my mouth. This is was truly excellent all the way around. Silky black pour with small ring of beige head. Roasty, woody aroma. Taste brings in some sweet roastiness, a nice mellow bitterness, and a lovely creamy texture. Thought this would be the evening's winner, but there was a better one out there....","  rDev An 8oz pour On draft as a pilgramage to Cigar City Brewing  Poured into a snifter , dark brown liquid, pencil thin Byron foam settles to a bubbly brown ring   Aroma of roast malts, chocolate, whiff of cinnamon-y spice  Taste is Cinnamon forward , roasted malts, peppery spiciness  Bit of acrid, bit of alcohol , dry roasted malt finish , good sudsing   Need to let it warm and taste it closer to room temperature. Taste improves as it warms  Very Good beer, but not worthy of such a lofty rating on the Beer Advocates top beer list","  rDev Ripe and spicy! Raw hide, baby! Hop on the Hunahpu express because everyone is invited! Like Burt Lancaster rolling around the Hawaiian shores with Deborah Kerr, this thang is torrid! Big, deep chocolate and spice like Beyoncé eating a piece of Hershey’s! I mean hot! Jay Z, move out of the way! Cuz Bae is here to stay!  Ayyyyeeeeeee!","  rDev 2016 release, bottled December 2015. Thick and black on the pour, with a thin layer of delayed-action head coming to life like a reanimated zombie. Rich chocolate and vanilla on the nose, with some chile aroma and mild cinnamon. Tastes like a Mounds bar with half the coconut traded in for cinnamon instead, but it manages to get a prominent cinnamon flavor without being overwhelming or aggressive. Likewise, the chile peppers are present in flavor but not in any level of spicy heat. I think I would try sitting on this for longer if I get another bottle at some point.","  rDev Was expected more from this beer with such a big reputation. A touch thin in body as well.","  rDev Pours a thick, oily pitch black coloration with a small, dark brown, creamy head. Smell is a little faint and has an oddly floral chili aroma to it, as well as lots of chocolate, a hint of cinnamon and a somewhat earthy, musty aroma. Taste is dominated by dark, bitter chocolate and a slight roastiness, with only subtle hints of vanilla and cinnamon, the cinnamon standing out a little more. The chili has the same oddly floral character as in the aroma and is not all that pleasant. There are also hints of dark fruit: fig, raisins, and of certain earthy hoppiness to this. Hardly any boozyness there at all. Finishes quite bitter, with the floral chili coming out even more in the aftertaste. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. I really dislike the chili pepper note in this because it has more of a floral than spicy character that seems a little odd. The balance also seems a little off, because even though the chocolate, roastiness and high bitterness complement each other quite well, that rich, roasted bitter chocolate character does not quite leave enough room for the spices to come out. Mouthfeel and body really are fantastic though, very rich, creamy, almost viscous.","  rDev Brown cocoa powder color head. Dark chocolate black with some purple hue.  Sweet dark chocolate. Cocoa mixed with light coconut. Peppers are strong presence and persistent mixing well with other notes. Smell is more pepper heavy.  Heavy but thin. Slight tingly burn and carbonation. Slight more burn in lasting finish.  Very good.","  rDev A 2017 750ml bottle  It is a viscous pour, with a thick, frothy beige head.   It smells like liquid Cocoa Puffs with vanilla and cinnamon. There is a bit of cayenne like pepper too.   It is a wonderful blend of flavors. Although vanilla is the most prominent and it combines with the layers of chocolate to make it taste pretty sweet, there is still plenty of roasted barley and bitterness on the back side and a nice pepper spice compliment.   The body is full and velvety smooth without being more chewy like Zhukov.   The flavors are really well balanced and this is an outstanding tasting beer, but I don't think the flavors pop or stand out as much as they do in the Double Barrel or with some other cinnamon and pepper beers like Jackie O's Oro Negro and Xocoveza. A little less vanilla and a little more pepper would be phenomenal","  rDev 2016 bottle, bottled on 12/30/15. Released March 12, 2016. 1 Pint, 9.4oz, 11.5% ABV. Incredible beer. Chocolate, coconut, vanilla, so perfect.  Look: Pours jet black, dark tan head of foam. Amazing thick syrupy body when poured into the glass. Smell: Admittedly a little soy sauce on the nose, but it is followed by rich chocolate and coffee, with subtle coconut undertones. Taste: Absolutely amazing. Met right away with bitter coffee , subtle yet rich chocolate and undeniable notes of coconut. The finishing notes bring out strong vanilla and more bitterness from a good black coffee. Feel: Incredibly smooth from start to finish. Slight but necessary carbonation. Sticky, and with a distinct spicy finish down the back of the throat.  What else is there to say? For me, this lived up to the hype and more. So many different components, all perfectly unified into this incredible beer. Even the peppers can be felt in the finish, and I'm just so amazed by this. Again a huge shoutout to my trade partner in Tampa for making this happen."]},{"Name":"Hop Nosh IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1416/73764/","Brewery":"Uinta Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.30,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev 12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles, leaves some lacing in my glass.

Bitter hoppy malty.","  rDev Pours a sunburst orange with a lighter orange/yellow at the top. Slightly murky tint to it. Head is a finger of snowy white foam with modestly good retention. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, orange, mango, resiny and dank hops. Light bready, earthy malts add a bit of balance and 'boniness' to the back-end of the aroma. It's a pleasant contrast to the initial hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine, mango, resiny, herbal and dank hops with bready, earthy, toasty malts.

Well done!","  rDev From notes 10/19/13: Pours a beautiful honey amber producing 3 fingers of frothy, somewhat lasting, white head that leaves heavy rings and webs of thick lace. Aroma is loaded with caramel malt sweetness with a grapefruit and thin pine hop profile; there is a vanilla-like hint present. Taste is similar but well balanced adding a strong herbal, floral note from mid-sip through the finish; it becomes more sweet and malt forward than the nose. A very robust hoppiness with a spicy finish that lingers well into the bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, silky with a nice peppery finish.","  rDev Copper with a hint of haze, a few fine bubbles rising, and 3 fingers of beige head.

Bottle 9/17/17 opened on 10/18/17  This appearance harkens back to the old days of darker amber hued ipa's. This is not your lighter, cloudy NE ipa....just a clear amber glow. The foam cap is clumpy and sparse, bubbly with solid rings on the edge.  The aroma has a dark, harvest wheat malt thing happening, under the obvious collection of pine tree sap, earthy grains and tropical, citric and tangy hops aroma's.  The hops are a tough, earthy and bitter effect, tangy and sour fruits, grapefruit mostly dominate the hop side. Amber style malts seem almost roasty and earthy. Acorns, dark wheat, dried leaves and serious earth tones prevail. A heavy, medium to full body and very crisp.

Hop Nosh IPA  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle,  BEST BEFORE 09/10/17U  and sampled on 08/07/17  $2 @ Giant, Havertown, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: Not my first Hop Nosh, I just never got around to reviewing it. It's a decent all-around IPA, although I tend towards examples with less caramel maltiness but we'll get to that later. Wow, I got a really full bottle. The beer is up above the top of the neck label. I hope that's not an issue, you usually get high-fills when the bottling line shuts down or there's some kind of gas pressure problem. It's got a very nice, two-finger thick head of fluffy off-white foam atop a hazy copper-colored body. The aroma is malty with lots of caramel, some orange, and pine. Hmm, this is not the freshest bottle I've ever had, I usually get brighter citrus but that's OK, I know what it's supposed to be like and I can rate it appropriately. The flavor follows with lots of caramel, soft golden and medium caramel, and spicy, piney, and softly citrusy hops. The bitterness rises above the maltiness midway and ushers it towards a dry finish where the pine and spiciness gently linger along with some subsiding caramelish malt. Ahh, looking back I notice that there are walls of broken lacing left behind - very nice! If it wasn't so hazy it'd score great, and I do give IPAs a lot of leeway because dry-hopping causes haze. Hmmm, looking at it it's really not that hazy so I think it still deserves a 4.25, especially as the surface still has a completely solid, and somewhat thick, creamy covering. What did I miss? Medium-bodied with a median carbonation that's gently crisp and then smooth. Overall, as I think I mentioned, it's a solid caramelish and citrusy IPA that can hardly be argued against. It's well made, and basic; nicely balanced, easy to drink, and satisfying.","  rDev 12 oz can poured into a pint glass, the beer is copper with a light chill haze. It has a thick tan head. BTW, love the can art. Best before 9/17/17 on the bottom of the can.   It has a nice aroma of C hops and caramel malts. To me, it has the classic American IPA smell.  The beer is pleasantly bitter with pine and citrus notes. The beer has a nice malt backbone and the malts add a bit of cracker and grain taste. There is a bit of tropical fruit mid-glass.   The mouth is pleasantly tongue coating.   This one hits all the right notes for me. Glad I got a 6 pack!","  rDev -spiegelau ipa glass.

Had an amber-copper color and a clear consistency. There was a two inch, foamy, long-lasting head. Very good lacing.  S: A very solid aroma of hops, citrus fruit, some malt, and a little caramel.  T: Tasted of a good amount of citrus fruit (tangerine and oranges, in particular), some tropical fruit (mangoes), lots of hops, light malt notes, and a hint of caramel. A nicely balanced flavor, with the hops and fruit commingling well together. Not a hop bomb, if that's what you're looking for, but very tasty.  F: A highly carbonated beer with a vibrant finish. Medium-bodied.  O: This is quite an enjoyable IPA. Sweet, hoppy, and drinkable.","  rDev From the really old (10 months past it's best by date) bottle, it pours a clear rosy amber with some yeast lumps and a really nice head. Lacing.

Great head retention and nice lacing. Strong aromas of tangerine, orange, pineapple, and blueberries. Very little malt in the nose. The taste follows suit, with prominent citrus and tropical notes. Some earthy/piney notes and a restrained malt presence. The body is medium and balances the hops well.","  rDev Best Before 10/8/16.   Super hazy, a bold golden color with a tight 2 finger head. Classy.  Stale hop, citrus, and sticky, stenchy toffee. An extra half point for the fresh citrus...but otherwise it's everything I hate in an IPA aroma.  Flavor is pure arm pit. Not even onion. Just arm pit. Dull pine, stale hops, and again a hit of fresh citrus. A calm, nice malt base at the rear, but otherwise it's just a mess.   Feel is medium bodied, creamy, sticky. The toffee remains on the palate long after it should.   Overall, even though this is a month after the best by date, I've had IPA's fair much better just a month out of date. Uinta's hop nosh is total garbage, even the base malts. I'll be dumping this.","  rDev Hop Nosh IPA brewed by Uinta Brewing Company, with an ABV of 7.30% This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a nice off white head. I really like the color of this IPA. The smell of Hop Nosh IPA is rich with hops, grains and malts. There is also a mild sweetness to the smell of this IPA. Hop Nosh IPA is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it. Now for the taste it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hops in this IPA. Then you pick up on the smoothness of grains and malts. There is also a nice grassiness to the taste of this brew. Hop Nosh IPA has a lot going on in it. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, the paint glass is nicely lined. This IPA has the same characteristics of most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.30% ABV in this brew. This IPA goes down just so smooth. The month feel of Hop Nosh IPA is Bold, Rich, smooth clean and refreshing.

A little less sticky as I drink.  Nose to me seems heavy on the malt side. Having home brewed, it seems a much cleaner version of my spent malt. There’s a less sweet, earthy to dry grass aspect relatively.  Taste has a decent amount of the malts expected from the aroma, but a mineral aspect that leans slightly chemical detracts a bit. The beer is light leaning medium with moderately aggressive though balanced malt/hop mix. The Saaz don’t bite too hard, but offer a peppery taste to the beer.  Not as skunky as I generally perceive green bottles from the old world (understanding they may not be made “over there”).

The color is a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. There is a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with grains an malts. Then you get a nice mix of bitterness from the hops. So far Pilsner Urquell is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on a nice amount of grassy grains an malts. Then some nice smooth hop bitterness at the end. The body of this brew is a soild medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. This brew would go nice on any occasion. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Pilsner Urquell a solid 4 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. If you are looking for a soild Pilsener you should look this brew up.

Clear, deep amber color, with a thick and foamy white head. Excellent head retention, tons of pretty lacing. Big malty aroma, with lots of caramel, toffee, and dark fruit, plus hints of grassy and herbal hops and tangy apple cider. These elements are present in the flavor profile as well, with lots of pleasant bitterness. Almost silky in mouthfeel, with a crisp, dry, and slightly astringent finish. A very flavorful and satisfying beer, and great with food.","  rDev 16oz can dated  MAY 25 19  poured into a pilsner glass shows a crystal clear yellow-gold body allowing a perfect view of an infinite ascension of bubbles from the base to the persistent 1/4  cap of tiny white bubbles leaving webbed lacing.

The taste is mildly bitter grassy hops up front rolling into a honey malt taste before closing with moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft, thin to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. There is a little diacetyl in the finish but it interacts nicely with the other flavors keeping it from being distracting. Overall, very good.

Lovely and well balanced hoppy flavour, pine needles and grapefruit again, not extreme - just very well made.","  rDev Let it begin with a pint can poured into a clear glass liter mug. Now, there's something to look at. The ale is a cloudy but bright amber with a bit of white head and lacing. It smells like hops and some more hops and not much more. The taste is dry and hoppy, but not overly bitter. The balance with a malt backbone missing in the aroma, is there for the mouth and provides a wonderful taste and mouthfeel sensation. A remarkably good IPA.","  rDev Pours a clear, but somewhat oily golden color. Thick 3 - 4 finger head collapses leaving just about. 1/2 inch layer of velvety foam on top of the beer. Beautiful lacing is left on the glass as its consumed.   The aroma is not as  massive and bursting  as the can would imply - rather I get some mild, even somewhat muted notes of pine, pine needles, grapefruit, and a touch of tangerine. Really hits that hallmark of the WCIPA in that its incredibly hop forward on the aroma.   Taste follows the nose with notes of pine, dried pine needles, sap, with almost a woody quality to it. Lighter notes of tangerine, grapefruit and citrus rind do come through, but with great deference to the pine notes. Almost no malt character to this one at all. There is a slight sweetness to this, reminiscent of a candied orange rind.   Feel is light, slick and a tad bit oily. Bright prickly carbonation frames the mouthfeel. Somewhat drier on the finish.   Overall, this is a really nice WCIPA. I would definitely drink this one again if it keeps showing up in IL fresh.","  rDev Rating from notes. Consumed November 2013.  Tangerine, pine needle, and resiny hop flavours. Some biscuit and caramel to balance. Orange zest, lychee, and grapefruit linger on the palate. A mind-blowing WC IPA.

Overall a very fine IPA. On draft at the Lazy Dog Saloon.","  rDev Another outstanding beer from a brewery I’ve grown to really trust. Nice golden-amber color with some great fluffy head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, lots of fruity zest hops and some piney hops in the background. Tastes of lots of fruit - grapefruit, orange, passionfruit, lemon, papaya, pineapple, a little mango - as well as some piney hops, vanilla, caramel, faint herbal hops and a great, well-balanced malt backbone. Nice and smooth mouthfeel, great carbonation. I will keep purchasing and trying any and all beers from AleSmith that I can find at my local stores.","  rDev Pours a orange-brown that contains a slight fog. Atop is a finger of off-white foam that retains well. Aroma is citrus, dank, resin, and pine hops, with the overall focus being on the resin syrup mingling with orange. Old school malts provide a smooth, sugary backdrop. Flavor profile is a mash up of traditional hops and bready malts. Specifically, it hits hop notes of resin, pine, and citrus, with the focus being on the first. Malt wise, it's bready, and pale. Despite having the IPA moniker, the hops maintain a great balance with the malts. Mouth feel is medium in thickness, with a semi-velvety texture that lends itself more to a sippable, flavorful IPA vs. being the go-to option for a hot tailgate (maybe a late fall/early winter tailgate). Overall, great balance between hops and malts while still showing off both. The mixer board has both at 6/10 in terms of volume/intensity - great.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz can.","  rDev Pours a light amber color clear with a fluffy off white head that laces well.  Aroma is nice west coast style, tangerine, orange, pink grapefruit, pine on touches of caramel base.

Floral and perfumy hops.  f) The juicy, fresh, well carbonated feel refreshes and thrills.","  rDev Canned on 11/22/17.  Comes in a clear, dark gold/light amber color. Topped by a big tight white head, very good retention; a foamy film always remains, leaving sheets of lacing.  Smells of blood orange, ruby red grapefruit, caramel, toffee, pine needle, pine cone, pine sap, wood/bark, and maybe a bit of pineapple. Very old-school West Coast IPA in a good way, and very fragrant.  Blood orange, pink grapefruit, and honey hit the palate right away. A bit of caramel and brown bread, but the malt comes across mostly like honey and mead. Faint pineapple and mango notes as well, followed by tons of earth and pine on the back end, and a big piney finish. Moderately bitter, balancing the malt well with some lingering pine and citrus and bitterness.  Feels medium-plus bodied, well-carbonated, smooth and flows easily across the palate. Finishes slightly sweet but with a massive piney hop bitterness to balance it out, leaving the mouth dry with lingering piney hop oils.  Overall, this is quintessential high quality West Coast IPA. Traditional, and yet still fantastic by today's standards. A magnificent IPA.","  rDev A 12oz can with a canned-on date of May 2017. Acquired a little while back from the Brewdog webshop. The label describes it as a classic American IPA.  A: Poured into an IPA glass. A deep, hazy amber hue with good carbonation and fine suspended sediment. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a patchy surface layer. Nice lacing.  S: Aroma of intense resinous hops with hints of pine, weed, grapefruit, citrus, peel, mild tropical fruit, caramel malt, ale yeast and stewed hops. Excellent - super hoppy.  T: Tastes of seriously resinous hops with notes of pine, dank weed, grapefruit, citrus, peel, subtle tropical fruit, stewed hops, caramel malt and ale yeast. Slightly sweet, followed by a robust hop-driven bitterness upon swallowing.  M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with spritzy carbonation and good body. Quite astringent; hop oils strip the palate. Aftertaste of bitter pine resin, weed, citrus peel, caramel malt and yeast.  O: Good stuff - a classic pine-laden IPA from the US. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are stuffed with resinous, citrussy hops underpinned by caramel malt. Nice body. Goes down a treat; worth seeking out if you love hops.","  rDev Poured from a 1 pint 6oz Bomber. I can now buy this in Canada.

Nice hoppy nose a real nice IPA that is all i need to say after over 1300 reviews.","  rDev American hops front and center . Aromas of grapefruit and tangerine lead into an abundance of fresh pine and tropical fruit notes followed by a crisp, resinous bitterness. The complex hop profile is supported by a firm malt presence to create an incredibly flavorful and well-balanced IPA.","  rDev (12 oz can, canned on 05/22/2017.... poured into a nonic)  L: rather clear, amber-colored liquid, slight yellowish tinge around the edges... beautiful, fluffy pad of off-white foam, silky sheen  S: orange and lemon flesh, perhaps some hints of taffy and menthol... bit of spice in the back... really, the prominent aroma is that of a hyper-dense, (orange) citrus candy/syrup... hint of buttery sandwich cracker (if that makes sense, like that peanut butter variety)... essence of phenolic booze, just a nip  T: densely-layered hop flavors - spicy citrus, fresh grass, tea-like leafiness... mildly earthy and pungent, bitter aftertaste at first; later, some dried yeast and black pepper creep up, all the while maintaining a buzzing bitter green tea note... the malt, despite being pushed to the back by the surging hops, does exhibit a strong enough presence with a prominent crumbly cracker and mildly nutty quality  F: dry and level in the middle, while the top of the palate is lightly aflame with the collective phenols and booze heat and the chest warm and slightly reddened... the back end dryness makes this easy to knock back... body takes on a silkier viscosity as it warms - but don't let it sit too long  O: what stands out is the bold hop and malt flavors (almost balanced) and its charged, spicy/warm/bitter finish with a more clipped back end than expected... the taste isn't all that unique, but it's forceful and enlivens the senses","  rDev A slightly cloudy amber appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a caramel hoppy herb that is very pleasant. Taste is also a caramel herb with a Boucher of hops","  rDev On cask. Fantastic. Citrusy grapefruit and orange.   Not too heavy.

Taste: Citrusy and bitter orange peel, mandarin and grapefruit followed by sweet-ish pineapple, biscuit malt and pine. The finish has a nice long resinous bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, dry-ish, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: A wonderfully tasty and balanced West Coast IPA. Also loving the cans!","  rDev Been looking forward to this one, it rates highly in the great pantheon of West Coast IPAs and I can still appreciate a decent American IPA (even if I do get bored of them at times). So what do I know about AleSmith? Very little... they’re another San Diego brewer, so expecting a real piney/citrus walloping from this fine brown glass bomber. They’ve been around since 1995 so that makes them one of the forefathers of the modern American craft beer revolution (not unlike fellow San Diegan Stone which has been around since 1996)... it’s amazing how long craft beer has been around in the states and how as late as 2005 it was impossible to find anything remotely craft in Australia, we really have come a long way, cheers beerethren!  Poured from a 650ml US bomber bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Hella cloudy [Hell yeah!] Gamboge body with a nice firm 2 centimetre cream-coloured head. Great head retention in a 7.25% ABV brew! Sanskrit lacing on in the side of the glass like all the great American IPAs that spring to mind (Founders, Deschutes, Victory, Sierra Nevada Torpedo, et al.), yep this is going to be a corker! 9/10.  S: Worryingly malty straight up with a caramel/biscuit nose - I’ve recently had major hop fade in the last few US IPAs I’ve reviewed so I’m pretty wary of that happening now. Absolutely no dating on the bottle either, so no idea how old this one is. Piney/grapefruit notes struggle to overcome the malt base, not off to a good start here. 7/10.  T: Dry cracker and piney hops from the off mingle with an earthy overtone, caramel and biscuit malts come in but thankfully don’t dominate the palate... but the big question is: Hop fade? A bit of that, nothing outrageous like the last 2 IPAs (though they were East Coast which adds an extra month to the container ships). I imagine the tropical notes described on the label suffered with the sea voyage most. Finishes with an assertively astringent woody/piney hop bitterness. Unabashedly West Coast IPA right here! (reminds me of Ballast Point Big Eye actually). 8/10.  M: Medium bodied with a soft but dense carbonation. 7/10.  D: Pretty decent example of a San Diegan IPA, not quite as good as the Stone stuff (they’re definitely more out there as a brewer, and hence why I like them). However a solid American IPA for sure. It doesn’t rewrite the rule book on IPA, but it also doesn’t disappoint in any way. 9/10.  Food match: Get it India! Curry that is.","  rDev Copper and hazy, almost no carbonation and 2 fingers of creamy, beige head.  Caramel, creme brulee, citrus, orange candy, big grapefruit and pith.  One sip and now I know why. All the talk, I mean. Great depths of complexity for an IPA, unparalleled in complexity in my opinion, and this is from a bottle that is likely quite old. I get purple bubblegum, lilacs, citrus and grapefruit peel, lemon here, zest there. Creme brulee, and battery acid, grapefruit juice and biscuit. So many layers and different on each sip. Lemon blossoms.  Moderate body, smooth and sticky, moderate carbonation.  This is an amazing brew. Wow. So glad I got it at the new bar in town, overpriced as I thought, so worth being able to try it. Drinking this one in Chiang Mai, Feb 8th, 2017.","  rDev L: Hazy golden color, one to two finger white head, excellent lacing, no visible carbonation.  S: Hops, tropical fruits, mango.  T: Hoppy, tropical fruits, mango. Superb!  F: Super smooth and silky. Amazing mouthfeel.  O: A world-class IPA, no doubt. Would happily drink on any occassion :)","  rDev Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Cigar City Brewing goblet.  A: Nice gold, mildly hazy with fairly low visible carbonation. Forms only a minimal white head - more of a ring of foam.  S: Tropical fruits (especially pineapple), sweet citrus and melons. A pleasant floral and fruit aroma with a touch of dank. The lightest of biscuity sweet malts. Interesting, and while not drastically different, it is a different approach than a lot of other IPAs.  T: Citrus - orange and tangelo. Pineapple and lychee tropical fruit; lesser flavors of dankness and melon. Mildly sweet biscuity malts but no distinct caramel or toffee. Moderately bitter in the hang with more tropical fruits. The fruit flavors last throughout the whole sip.  M: Medium body for style, and the alcohol is quite well-hidden. This has a reasonable amount of small bubble carbonation - it ended up a lot less flat than it looked.  O: I thought this was really enjoyable, especially for a widely distributed IPA. I believe this was a limited-time thing for distribution in Florida - if this were regularly on the shelves, I’d definitely grab them intermittently as something different. And that something different is saying something these days for IPAs.","  rDev This is a well made, old-school IPA. No tropical fruit bomb here. Instead I found a nice balance of citrus rind, pine, grassy bitterness, and cookie dough sweetness. Very easy drinking for the abv, hope to have this one again.","  rDev L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a bright amber color and a cloudy consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that lasted an average amount of time. Fantastic lacing.  S: A decent enough aroma of hops, citrus, malt, pine, and a little caramel.  T: Tasted of a lot of citrus ingredients (grapefruit, in particular), a light malt presence, a bunch of grassy hops, some mild caramel notes, and also a hint of pine resin. The main problem here are the grassy hops. They kind of through everything out of balance. Nonetheless, all the other ingredients are pretty solid.  F: A well-carbonated beer with a hoppy, sharp finish. Medium-bodied.  O: This beer doesn't quite rise above its flaws, but it is worth trying Drinkable."]},{"Name":"Big Eye","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/199/709/","Brewery":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.00,"Score":90.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 ml bottle, from Fakta Hirtshals.

In addition, I become aware of the zesty citrus quality. The interplay between malt and hops begins alternating in feel, providing an interesting balance.

Taste follows the nose with notes of weedy hops, dank notes, wood, and some light orange and citrus notes. There is a noticeable malt backbone to the beer. Feel is light, smooth and oddly refreshing in a way.   Overall it is a nice IPA. I think I am somewhat less blown away by it than most, but it is still a very nice IPA.","  rDev I got this in a trade with the overly generous and kind Beergoot  An incredible beer all around, very bitter on its first sips before blowing you away with its drinkability and refreshing taste. Very well balanced and engaging IPA I’d drink all day long, all year long if I could.  Thanks again Dave, cheers!","  rDev Pretty on par with heady topper smooth herbal bitterness sticking sweet dank goodness balance at max peak! The hate I don't understand its a great IPA especially when you can pick it up with less than two weeks of age you peasants!   Overall a more drinkable version of Heady topper than I wish I could find more often!","  rDev Pours a hazy color of grapefruit juice with a finger of head. The nose has bright notes of citrus, particularly grapefruits. The flavor is has a solid hop resin quality coupled with modest sweet citrus notes. The body is spot-on - maybe even a bit hearty for the style.   This offering drinks like a much bigger DIPA. It is a really nice blend between the new-kid juicy IPAs and old school bitter West Coast IPA style.  Shockingly, I am going to go on record saying that I like it more than Heady!","  rDev Pours a nice cloudy orange yellow color with a medium sized white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malts and then big floral and citrus hop aromas. Taste is similar but not as sweet or heavy on the hops as the nose lets on. It's a great mix of floral, citrus, and a hint of melon hops with a more tasteful toasted malt underlying it all. Smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, overall an excellent beer.","  rDev Shared can at regional tasting. Slightly hazy yellow colour, white head. Decent fruity aroma. Decent fruity flavour too, solid bitterness. Might well sample again.","  rDev Pint can of Focal Banger served, as is my preference, in a pint glass. Appears to be dated 04/01/21. Pours thick murky yellow and forms a nice thick head. Aroma is a bit yeasty. Fruity aroma is not too potent to my nose, but there's some lemon and passionfruit juice. Flavor is a completely different level, with pineapple and tropical punch blasting through a bitter, hoppy backdrop which is unmistakably an IPA. Where this beer really excels is that it is both a juicy NE IPA and an American IPA at the same time, compromising on neither.  I'm tasting this side by side with the more famous Heady Topper, which I recall not liking quite as much when I first tasted them side by side in, I believe, 2017. Heady is a bit clearer in my glass and it might have a slightly better hop aroma. But the combination of flavors and balance of Focal Banger is just so much more impressive to my palate that it will always be the better beer in my opinion. And at 7% vs. 8% the difference between single and double seems pretty dubious to me -- though for sure Heady Topper tastes more like a double.  I'd love to taste this side by side against the best NE IPAs I've had from PNW breweries including Gigantic, Hopworks (Totally Chill), Reuben's (Hazealicious), and Breakside.","  rDev Canned 06/22/21  Appearance - Poured a few ounces into a glass, hazy and straw in color with a white, half finger width head. Fair retention. Decent lacing, with some broken webbing, lines and small spotting. The rest of the review comes from drinking out of the can.   Smell - Really hoppy aroma. Orange, green leaf, lesser grapefruit, pine and a light bready sweetness.   Taste - Follows the nose to a tee. The fresh hop character really stands out. Orange peel, grapefruit, green leaf, lesser pine and an underlying bready malt sweetness. Not super complicated, but that hop freshness can't be understated. Aftertaste lingers with grapefruit pith and a hint of grass.   Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with fair carbonation. Slick, easy drinker with a clean, slighty dry finish.   Overall - It's great, but didn't quite live up to the hpe for me. Actually reminds me a lot of Heady. I'd love to try them side-by-side at some point.","  rDev Appearance - Drink it from the can! The can looks cool!  Smell - The nose previewed the dankness to come.   Taste - The profile began with lemon before bitter grass established itself. It was dank. Mosaic hops were prominent than Citra hops. The bitterness lingered nicely.   Mouthfeel - The full body allowed the bitterness to linger. Carbonation was very active.   Overall - Review #1500 was great.","  rDev Can dated 01/28/21 into a Spiegelau IPA glass.  L: Pours hazy white yellow with 2+ fingers of pillowy white head with great retention and left mixed lacing.  S: Potent citrus with some prominent floral notes, then breadiness, slight hints of dank and tropical fruit underneath.   T: Follows the nose very well, with slight additional pine dimension. Finishes with plenty of bitterness and medium acidity, acidity lingers and drys the palate.   F: Low-medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, tingles on the tongue, slick on the swallow.  O: Definitely my jam, loved it!","  rDev From a 16 ounce can dated 12/10/2020, a short pour gets a yellow hazy straw color. Had a fabulous head on the second pour. I tried it straight from the can too. Its aroma favors an almost skunky citrus smell that is very inviting. The taste is grapefruit, lemon, orange and the right amount of bitterness that wanes as you drink more. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing straight from the can. This is truly a fine NEIPA. I hope I get the chance to try it again. A special thanks to @laketang for the heads up on getting this Focal Banger and a couple more in the process that I don't normally get in Texas. I will admit I enjoyed it more poured in the proper glassware. The aroma is extra special. 24Jan2021.","  rDev Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip.  Appearance: hazy medium golden hue; it certainly looks convincing.  Smell: dank and almost barnyard-y. It’s grassy and earthy; I like it but it’s certainly unique.  Taste: earthy hops with a dank element, some citrusy element; it's even a little bit ... gamey. As per the style, there's a low bitterness. Overall, it’s kinda weird, but I like it.   Mouthfeel: medium body with a delicious and amazing creaminess. Outstanding!  Overall: this beer has grown on me. It’s dank and earthy as hell, but find I'm starting to dig it.","  Served from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Pilsner glass at Legends in New Suffolk, NY; canned 07/01/2020. A: Pours a hazy, golden color with a three finger, foamy, white head, more than a finger of retention, and thick, foamy rings of lacing.  S: Yeasty toastiness on opening. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, caramel, pine, and barley. T: Semisweet. Flavors follow the nose with more of a lemon citrus element. Strong but nicely blended bitterness.  M: Light medium bodied with strong persistence of carbonation. O: This is my second beer from The Alchemist. Delicious.","  rDev At 54 degrees, pours opaque almost hazy deep gold with some clarity under three fingers of rocky/mixed bubbles foam; long cap retention; medium heavy lacing that clings to the glass. Dank grapefruit and lemon nose. Weedy bitter citrus - grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange; semi sweet bready malt; some onion as liquid warms; bitter citrus finish. Medium body, moderate minus carbonation; bitterness (90 IBU) coats the tongue, but no hop astringency; no warmth from 7% abv. Overall a very tasty enjoyable IPA; nice pithy citrus bitter linger; great balance of English malts and bitter hopping; I could drink two cans in a row!","  Circumstances: A pint can poured into a clear glass liter mug. I know what the can says. Once, I tried a Heady Topper straight from the can. It did not enhance the taste for me. The Beer: The color is a light golden amber with a fluffy white head that lingers. Not an appreciable amount of glass lace. There's a modest IPA odor in the air. You know, hops and malts. Obviously, a highly crafted beer, but I don't think I've developed the requisite taste for Mosaic hops. That is acknowledged as odd, because I do enjoy Simcoe hop characteristics. Of course, there are other contributors to a beer's taste. The hop presence in Focal Banger is excellent. The drink is malty forward, then dry and somewhat bitter at the finish. It's very good, but not perfect. I get a little more alcohol taste here than in some other Alchemist concoctions. Maybe I should try it from the can.","  rDev Canned on 01/20/20, a victim of COVID — thanks Bethany for your effort! Poured carefully into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint (the second can of the 4-pack).  A: Lemonade yellow, hazy but you can see through it, with 1-finger of off-white head and prodigious lacing but crud and floaties throughout.   S: Pineapple, peach, mango, and light melon with plenty of grapefruit to go around.  T: Flavor is a half-step behind the aroma in intensity but definitely good despite the age with pineapple, peach, mango, strawberry, and grapefruit with a bit of honeydew melon in the finish. Low-medium bitterness with lots of tropical fruit esters.  M: Super smooth with light-medium body, low-medium carbonation, soft and easy to drink without being flabby.  O: I enjoyed FB a lot but would love a chance at a fresher can. All in all, held up through a pandemic in my friend’s fridge pretty well. Will update the next chance I get to try it!","  rDev 16oz can. Poured out a cloudy, golden orange color with a good-sized, off-white head of foam. It left sticky rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of grapefruit, mango, orange peel, pine and sweet caramel. Big, citrusy burst of flavor with piney bitterness and a toasted caramel finish.","  rDev Poured out of a 16 oz. can dated 6/11/20. Two weeks old at time of review.  Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a rocky two and a half finger bright white head that sticks around for a while.  Aroma consists of ruby red grapefruit, tangerine, lemonhead candy, valencia orange, floral, lime, slight pineapple, herbaceous dankness, pine. Table sugar, slight caramel, and some bread coming from the malt.   Taste is ripe tangerine, tangelo, valencia orange, orange peel, lemonhead candy, some mango juice, slight peach, slight pineapple, bright floral, grass, herbaceous dankness, pine resin. Table sugar, slight caramel, and breadiness come out from the malts, balancing the beer. Firm bitterness comes in the form of orange peel and pine resin.  Solid medium body. Soft, slick, slightly oily, slightly sticky.  Comparing this to Heady Topper, I think I lean more towards this one. Heady is still outstanding, but this one has a touch more complex fruit flavors with that same great dankness and clean bitter finish. The Alchemist certainly knows how to make a hop-forward, but balanced brew.","  rDev L:. Drank most out of the can as it suggest but poured some to see what it looks like. Pours a slightly hazy gold yellow with a very nice frothy white head and no lacing on the glass.  S:. Lots of sweet tropical fruit, including orange, grapefruit lemon, also floral hops and notes of onion. Smells quite sweet and hoppy.  T:. Sweet tropical fruit, including orange, grapefruit, lemon, floral hop notes and hints of onion and chive. A lighter to medium bitterness. The bitterness does help with some of the sweetness.  F:. Smooth creamy big body.  O:. This is a good IPA but I like Heady better, this one just doesn't seem as unique as Heady.","  rDev 6.3.20 canning date. First time with Focal.  L - 4 - poured a splash in a glass, interesting unfiltered look to it (wouldn't call it haze). Golden opaque. Good lacing. S - 4.25 - did not expect the level of onion-garlic-grapefruit funk on this, really surprising. Had half from can, half from glass, and from the can the  everything bagel  aroma was pretty overwhelming, tamer in the glass. T - Where Focal shines, great hop pith and grapefruit, really good bite and bitterness without being annoying or too much. No hop burn whatsoever. F - Great balance, carbonation, keeps its liveliness on the palate the whole way throught.  O - a great beer, I get the love for this.","  rDev Cloudy bright yellow-orange body; outstanding carbonation; head is dense and creamy, bone white in color. Very little aroma; some biscuit notes and very subdued fruitiness. Toasted bread with pineapple and very mild orange; low-key acidity; beautifully nuanced hop bitterness midway and far into the finish. Heavy body; rich and creamy; starts juicy and maintains it through the finish; dryness develops midway through and blends nicely with the juiciness.  At long last, I get to try this beer that so many other BAs have posted about over the years. I don't know why the lack of distinct aroma (but I have another can to try later). This offerings was canned 06/03/20, so it is fairly fresh. Regardless, there is no denying this is a beautiful and delicious beer!","  rDev 16 oz. can partially poured into a wine glass, maybe I'll drink the remainder from the can, we shall see. Pours clear with a greenish hue from the can and morphs into a hazy maple with a cap of white foam. Offers decent retention and light lace, settling into a surface film. Nose is dank with a light touch of citrus but more herbal and with a faint garlic/shallot note which does diminish a bit with warming. Hoppy indeed, but not quite judiciously hopped.  Taste follows yet can get a tad watery when first hitting the tongue, yet firms up and has a solid finish. Fairly high bitterness for the sub style but that isn't a negative for me. Still it does slow the pace down a bit. Overall pretty good quaff but not earth shaking, but at a month old some might consider it ancient.","  rDev Wow! What a beer! I thought that Heady Topper would be my favorite beer from here, but I was wrong. To me, this is perfection. Heady Topper has a waxy smoothness (which I love) which gives it a moreishness, but Focal Banger is more in your face with the hops, that keep going and going and going, with a piney blast of bitterness, but always supported by a perfectly matched malt base that lends enough body and sweetness to allow the palate never to tire. Just a masterpiece.","  rDev 2020-05-16 16oz can served in a crystal snifter. I think dated 04-20-2020. Got it from CraftShack.  Pours fairly hazy, light amber, pretty head, lots of carbonation. Smell is grapefruit pith, I think.  Taste is quite bitter -- honeysuckle and flowers up front. Pine and grapfruit zest in the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium and dry. Overall, really solid IPA.","  rDev Canned on 4/27/2020. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a cloudy, dirty tangerine color with an enormous, volcanic, milk-white head and thick, creamy lacing. The fragrant smell features grapefruit rind, lemon peel, onion, pine needles, whiffs of sweet fruit - pineapple and ripe melon, and floral hops. The taste opens with a hint of sweet melon and pineapple that is quickly overwhelmed by a wave of tart grapefruit rind, resinous pine and bitter, biting Citra and Mosaic hops. If anything, it seems more bitter than 90 IBU. It has a creamy, full mouth feel with a pleasant level of carbonation, and it drinks big for 7% ABV. Overall, Focal Banger deserves all of the accolades it receives. It deftly bridges the gap between a hazy, fruity New England IPA and a bitter West Coast rendition. I think the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. It's at the very pinnacle of American brewing.","  rDev Poured at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous murky yellow with considerable white head. Nose is so vibrant. Funky and hoppy to the extreme. Resin, grapefruit peel, peach, and some grass. Taste is super smooth - definitely hoppy, but not overwhelming at all. Tropical fruit, grapefruit (dominant), leather, and funky. Very worth a try.","  rDev A big thanks to a superb trader, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a slightly hazy golden/orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dank, citrus. Taste is of grapefruit, pine, some tropical fruits, significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth trying.","  rDev I don't have a lot of access to this or heady so I am certainly not able to compare them side by side.  This IPA is full of citrus and white grapefruit flavor and has a nice bitter finish. The flavor profile and balance is exactly what I look for in an IPA.  The feel is pretty smooth but could be a little bit more oily.  Overall this is one of the best IPAs. Period.","  rDev 16 oz can poured (I know) into a tulip pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with floaties, chunks, etc. Not pretty at all. Piney, bitter, good amount of citrus and some tropical fruit. Not as  drinkable  as a NEIPA which is kind of what I was expecting. I enjoyed the second can I had (consumed two weeks later) much more than the first, possibly because I had a good idea what to expect. Definitely enjoyed this more than Heady but still a disappointment overall.","  rDev Some drank from the can, some poured into a snifter  A: Pours hazy golden amber with a creamy pale tan head that slowly settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick lacing. There were a couple floaties doing a cool lava lamp thing.   S: Dank herbal notes, spicy pine, citrus zest, tropical and stone fruit slowly comes out and begins to take over, lightly toasty bready malt, and a touch of caramel sweetness.   T: Zesty citrus, grapefruit, lemon, lime, and tangerine, resinous pine, slowly opens up to show a little tropical fruit, mango, apricot, peach, papaya, and passion fruit, definitely has a dank herbal side, grassy and floral notes, slightly toasty bready malt, and just a touch of sweetness.   M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, resinous with some lingering bitterness.  O: It's interesting hearing about this beer vs actually having it in hand and drinking it. I was expecting more of a juice bomb style, when in actuality, and as noted on the can, it's a well hopped American IPA. It actually has kind of a west coast flair to it. Once I shifted my brain into that zone I definitely appreciated it more. Would love to have regular access to this, but I'll take what precious little I can get and enjoy it thoroughly.","  rDev -cloudy yellow-orange can pour with a 3 cm foam cap and a rich tropical nose and sprucy notes. The flavor is flush with mango, orange and melon. There is a resinous underbody and a bready malt line. This is a superb and enjoyable brew.","  rDev Can courtesy of yllib.  Golden slight haze.  Nice mostly citrusy nose. Not super strong.  Taste is what I think of as a west coast hop profile but with some slight tropical flavors in the background.  Really nice thick body.  Had heady topper for the first time a couple weeks ago and can’t help but compare. Where heady seemed to be pushing the balanced hop flavor as far as it could go, this is more restrained and pleasant.  If I had to pick one to drink regularity it would actually be this one.","  rDev The ever elusive Focal Banger!  Despite what the can says I ended up pouring it into a glass.   It's cloudy, but ever so slightly. In many ways this OG NEIPA is refreshingly clear. There's a pleasant and inviting melony note on the nose, with melony and citrusy flavors standing out on the palate. Tartly bitter, with a nice drying finish. What's there not to love?","  rDev Pours bright peach gold with a bit of haze. The frothy, chunky head lasts forever, draping the glass in foam. huge citrusy, tropical hop notes in the aroma. Toasty, nutty specialty malts in there too. The taste is abrasively hoppy with lots of pineapple, mango, apricot, white grapefruit notes and very high bitterness. Doughy malts manage to have a presence at the table, but always in the background. The mouthfeel is full bodied with high carbonation. High bitterness and floral, fruity hops in the everlasting finish.  A fantastic IPA. Very hoppy and bitter. Complex and drinkable. A must try.","  rDev Pale yellow in color with a hazy complexion. Plenty of lacing on my glass. There’s a quarter inch of dishwater white on top. The aroma is of earthy mosaic hops. I’m tasting lots of earthy to slightly grassy hops and a touch of light malt. The mouth is very smooth and inviting."]},{"Name":"1554","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/192/1914/","Brewery":"New Belgium Brewing Company","Style":"Lager - European Dark","Alcohol":6.00,"Score":86.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken.

Nice dark brown served with a thin head but good lacing. Toasted malt smell and taste. Nice earthiness and pleasant crispness. Good beer!","  rDev Dark mahogany brown with gold highlights around the edges. Good tan cap and decent lacing.  Herbal, spicy, slightly coffeeish, toffeeish aroma with something like dark figs in the background. Not really catching any hops but these heavy flavors usually cover that up anyway.  Taste on entry is dark toffee quickly followed by the herbal element. Don't know exactly what that element is, perhaps a lager yeast at warmer temperature fermentation has created that but it's in there and it taste good. Mid palate I'm getting more of the plummy, ripe fig influence which is just adding layers to the first impression flavors. Spicy, clove like threads weave in by the finish and linger in the aftertaste along with a touch of coffee but no roast bitterness.   Full texture with balancing carbonation.  Sometimes a dark brew based on roasted malt can throw off some bitterness along with the rich flavors. Not here, the elements I'm describing work together nicely. I don't quite know what kind of animal this is, an ale influenced lager or a lagered ale, but the jammy, figgy, roasty, toasty, clove stuff shout Belgian while it drinks like a strong lager and a good one at that. Complex yet restrained, flavorful yet sophisticated, a whole lotta shakin going on.","  rDev On tap at Victoire in Rochester, NY.  This one pours a dark brown (not black), with a small white head, and a good amount of lacing.  Smells like dark fruit, dark breadiness, chocolate, caramel, and prune.  This kind of feels like a Belgian scotch ale or something, maybe. It's quite surprisingly fruity, and low on roasted malt character, unfortunately, with a strong fruity yeast character, and light chocolate and caramel. This isn't exactly what I expected it to be.  This is light bodied, with a normal level of carbonation for the style.  This is interesting, and certainly drinkable, but I'd definitely wish for a bit more crispness.","  rDev New Belgium 1554, 5.6% ABV, 21 IBU. Pours medium viscosity and light black, with a one finger off-white head that left decent lacing. Nose is malty, bready, slightly nutty, taste follows, with very little bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall excellent.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a dark brown to almost black with a medium sized tan head. The aroma has a great malt smell. The flavor is malt, with some coffee, chocolate and bread. This is an outstanding beer.","  rDev  Best by 11/9/14 ; drank 9/17/14 @ the Yarchives.   Poured from the bottle into a glass.  Brown/purple hue.   Tan head; thick lace.   Plum, mocha &amp; fresh earth nose.   Medium thin mouthfeel.   Mild chocolate &amp; plum flavors. A dry but not overly bitter finish. As this warms, fresh earth notes emerge.   Not super flavorful but enjoyable as a session brew."]},{"Name":"IPA","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/98/311/","Brewery":"Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall","Style":"IPA - English","Alcohol":5.90,"Score":82.0,"Comments":["  rDev Not one of the better ones I have had from Harpoon, but still solid enough to enjoy. Comparatively speaking, it's not as sweet smelling or juicy as others, but the mouthfeel was full-bodied which made up for a less than favorable taste. Again, when you take it all in, it's solid. Just not necessarily memorable.","  rDev The claim is  New England's First IPA  and that may be. Most beer historians credit Ballantine as being the first to brew one in the U.S., but that was in New York. Enough history, let's empty a twelve ounce can into a clear Imperial pint glass and review it. First, it's a lovely bright copper-amber with a sparse, but enduring white head. There's plenty of malt to be had by the nose. The taste is sharply hoppy, with the malt failing to keep up. The hops are boldly bitter, earthy, yet finishing dryly. This is a good bitterly hopped AIPA, lacking only a little malty counterbalance. It may not offer enough complexity for some, but this is a spot on traditional IPA.","  rDev From a 19.2oz can, dated 04/05/21. Served in a willi becher.  Pours a crystal clear copper-gold with two fingers of dense, foam insulation-like head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, creamy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing. Honestly, I wasn’t prepared for it to look this good.  Nose is sharp, grainy and vaguely cider-like. Crackers and apple skins.  Taste is dry like soda crackers, crisp and biting. Apple skin, orange oil, turpentine.   Feel is crisp and clean, drying, medium bodied with brisk carbonation.  There was a time I drank quite a lot of this and I guess I wasn’t as stupid as I remember myself being because this is mighty tasty. The fact that it’s only a month old may have something to do with it. At any rate, the can label promises ‘hoppy, balanced, crisp’ and fucked if it isn’t all of those things.  (Replaces a 3.48 rating-without-review dated 05/17/15).","  rDev Pours a foggy dark orange with a finger of off-white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is resin, pine, citrus and herbal hops with a dab of biscuity, bready, earthy malts behind. Flavor profile is citrus, herbal, resiny, piney hops with a little sweetness at the back. Biscuity, bready and earthy malts firm up the finish just a touch. There is a touch of bready yeast the back as well, adding a little softness and stickiness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a very thin crispness delivered via a thin, razor-sharp crispness right at the front. Consistency is medium. Overall, crispness is great, along with the delicate balancing act between the hops and malts. Despite being an IPA, and having forward hops, it isn't abrasive or in your face.   Served in a 10oz stemmed glass from a 12oz can.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, bottled 05/03/19; purchased cold single... poured into Spiegelau IPA glass)  L: crystal-clear, amber liquid; tall, rocky, billowy-bouncy build of crystalline, off-white foam; broad expanses of lace  S: grapefruit rind, tangerine oil, vaguely ginger-y spice, orange jelly candy, bit of floral musk, hint of alcohol... kind of a bygone American-made, British-influenced IPA character - the lack of personality in its esters   T: similar citrus character as the aromas, with a rather bready malt swell in the finish which carries long into the aftertaste, along with a spicy, potpourri, herbal hop hum... lovely musky, earthy element to the lingering hop oils; very little residual apparent malt sweetness  F: soft carbonation; light, foamy texture to its body; sedate lingering warmth... between its blanket softness and cozy glow, very nice  O: briefly a sought-after favorite of mine back at least a dozen years ago, in a day when I can actually remember IPAs not being that popular... maybe reminiscing a bit, but it's still a decent beer, and not much different from what I recall... I hope to revisit it off and on going forward, but can I get a fresh bottle down here? (1552)","  rDev Thanks, Denny.   I clear copper with a dense white head with good retention and lacing this looks good. The nose is a blend of delicately floral hops, a blend of citrus and some pine, along with a mildly sweet malt character. Bitterness of burnt sugar is present. The palate opens light and restrained, with a mild hop bitterness complemented by a grainy, burnt sugar bitterness. A mildly green, woodsy, leafy hop character is present as well. The mid palate takes on a mild mineral note before the finish which is a blend of mild bitterness and citrus. Decent stuff.","  rDev 12oz bottle with a best by 11-15-18 date 1/2  white head retains at 1/4  for a long period. Amber/gold - deep color, good looking IPA. Foamy lace. Very floral hops, maybe a hint of lime and sweet candy malt aroma underneath. More of a zesty lime up front, melon, some flavors that lean floral and then the finish is taken over by the lightly caramel-y malt bill. Medium body, south of full for an IPA. Soft mouthfeel, low to mid carbonation. Light bitterness. Not a  Session IPA  but well balanced and one I could maybe session.","  Bottled and part of Asda's new craft beer line up pours a golden body with decent white foamy head the aroma is like a fairly standard EPA there's a slightly disconcerting to be honest sweet barley flavour at the front that warms to a dryness its got a good body just a bit of an odd but enjoyable flavour","  Poured from a 12oz bottle into glass. Best before date stamped on neck of bottle is '05/15/18'. Clear, deep gold colored body. One finger white head settles to scattered cap and ring. Scattered strings of lacing. Aroma is floral hops, earthy malts, and a little caramel. Taste follows aroma with the floral hops. Has a solid malt backbone. A little fruity and earthy. Mild bitterness towards the end. A little sweet at the very end. Drinks crisp, with thin to medium mouth feel. Good carbonation support. Toward the style of the English IPA, with the sweeter malt component. No real complaints but no real accolades either.","  rDev Served from a tap into a conical pint glass at Empire in Boston, Massachusetts. Retasted on 07/31/19, beer bottled 12/17/18. A: Pours a crystal clear, amber color with one inch head that resolves to more than a cap. Spidery, spotty lacing.  S: Aromas of mango, pitted fruit, caramel, and a little pine. Malty.  T: Fairly dry, leaning to sweet. Caramel and fruit flavors lead. Bitterness is light and offsets excessive sweetness.  M: Light bodied with low carbonation. Crisp, refreshing finish.  O: I enjoyed this beer. It was much lighter bodied than most IPAs. It is definitely more in the English subcategory in that it does not have the big, loud flavors and aromas of an East or West Coast. Sometimes subtlety is what is needed and this delivers that. Solid flavor, refreshing, and the potential to pair it with almost anything: what is not to like?","  rDev 12oz bottle with a date  Look is aight. Head fades real quick to nada. Smells slightly hopy, lot of malt. Taste is a muted ipa, more of a pale ale with a ton of malt.  Not bad stuff, just really unremarkable, even considering the style of IPA, this doesn't deliver","  rDev A: Pours a clear golden copper in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and moderate golden yellow + amber colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall sudsy foamy light beige head that slowly reduces to a large half finger thick cap in the center of the glass surrounded by a large patch of thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate to significant amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Light to moderate aromas of floral + citrus/grapefruit pith hops over the top of light aromas of toasted + biscuit malts as well as a hint of caramel malts.  T: Upfront there is a just shy of moderate flavor of toasted, biscuit, and caramel malts with a hint of caramel sweetness. That is followed by moderate flavors of floral + citrus/grapefruit pith hops which impart a light to moderate amount of bitterness which fades away pretty slowly.  M: Just shy of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin/watery in the finish.  O: A pretty easy to drink and enjoyable English IPA - nothing jumps out about it but if you put it into perspective of when it was introduced to the market, this one is pretty decent. Alcohol is well hidden. A classic.","  rDev I recently had this beer in Boston. It may not be a top notch brew but it is a good easy drinking local IPA.  Look: golden/amber with a thin white head.  Aroma: citrus and some pine  Taste: caramel, citrus, a bit floral and some pine, a fairly mild flavor for an IPA.  Feel: light to medium mouthfeel","  rDev Had on tap at Union Oyster House in Boston, MA.  Appearance was decent; clear golden beer but with little head. Aromas and flavors seem to be in line for an old-school American IPA, but are muted compared to the best modern examples. Mouthfeel is a bit wanting, with low carbonation and low hops bitterness. Overall, this comes across more like an American Pale Ale than an IPA.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a clear golden orange body, one finger thick white head, good retention, lots of frothy lacing. Smell is marmalade, pine, orange peel, grainy sweetness, caramel. Very English in style. Flavour is caramel, grain and orange marmalade. Not too sweet by any means, which is nice. It's malty but not too malty; a nice hop and mild bitter presence makes this approachable. Mouthfeel is medium-lighter bodied, appropriately carbonated, mild zesty bitterness with a bit of marmalade on the finish. A classic, and just had to tick this one. Now that's a blast from the past.","  rDev This beer pours a pale copper with an average head. The aroma is made up of moderate caramel, floral notes, pineapple, and dried peach. The flavor features a solid malt body, with strong floral and perfumey flavors, candied pineapple, cedar, and other rather woody flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some clinging bitterness, and foamy carbonation. Overall this is different, but maybe to perfume centric for my taste.","  rDev Appearance: Clear gold, small head.  Smell: Floral, light toffee.  Taste: Mild toffee sweetness balanced by citrus bitterness which shifts to a more grassy flavor and finish.  Overall: Harpoon recently started distribution to MN so I picked up a 6er. I thought it was going to be a American IPA so slightly disappointed to find it's the English style, but I ended up enjoying it anyway. It stayed away from the tea-like bitterness I don't like in English-style IPA/PA's and kept to a more citrus/grassy hop flavor.","  Usually a fan of New England beers, I find this one to be watery, and mid-pack at best. Shipyard and Smutty much better than Harpoon.  A: Pours a clear pale amber with half an inch head. Clear pale like a Vienna Lager, ala Sams. No retention, scant lace.   Smell: Sprouts mild floral hops, grassy, hay, a bit of caramel malt. Meager.   T: Again like Sams Vienna Lager, it starts with caramel and fruity malt sweetness. Follows smell but more full. A great base for a black and tan and closer to a pale ale. Hops come out toward the finish, but are mild, tame.  F: The body is light, fairly crisp, again like Sams. and subdued. Clean finish, good food beer, but boring?   O: An old style, NE pale ale.","  rDev A darker srm than average for an ipa. Head was 1/2  off white. Aroma was almost completely devoid of hops. Shit no man, I believe you'd get your ass kicked for that.  Taste and mouthfeel are more reminiscient of an amber ale. There's more malt and roasting there than your average mass produced lager, but as for the ales, there just isn't the hopping, much less the india pale ale style. Is there brown malt in this? Bready toffee notes. Zucchini bread and shit in a bottle.","  rDev Pours golden amber with a frothy white foam head. Smells like sweet malt, some orange citrus, floral earthy herbs, biscuity cracker, and grassy pine. Tastes like sweet malt, mild caramely toasted biscuity cracker, some orange citrus, grapefruit rind, with floral earthy herbs and dank grassy pine. Feels medium-light bodied, creamy with moderate low carbonation. Overall a real nice IPA.","  rDev Look: It pours a light golden color which a white head and plenty of lacing.   Aroma: It has aromas of floral hops, and some citrus.   Taste: It has a grassy hop flavors which floral elements, citrus, and a bit of toast. The initial flavors are a bit sweet.   Feel: It has a light body close to moderate, which a mildy bitter finish.  Overall: It is a somewhat flavorable hoppy beer that doesn't have the long lasting bitter finish that is produced by most IPA's.","  rDev Best by date of 05/15/16  Appearance - Pours clear and glows golden orange with a fluffy, eggshell white, finger width head. Great retention, eventually dissipating to a thin, consistent layer of suds across the surface. Displays great lacing, with broken sheets and spotting making up the bulk of it.  Smell - Floral and spicy hops with a hint of lemon and a strong, bready malt aroma.  Taste - Follows the nose. Balanced notes of hop and malt meet with notes of floral character, faint lemon and bready, biscuity malt sweetness. A touch of grain comes through near the finish. Lingers with a distant citrus pith bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body with moderate, soft carbonation. Velvety smoothness before turning a crisp, mostly dry finish.  Overall - This is a fine English IPA. Good, solid, drinkable brew."]},{"Name":"Raison D'Être","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/64/1180/","Brewery":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","Style":"Strong Ale - Belgian Dark","Alcohol":8.00,"Score":83.0,"Comments":["  rDev Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad.

The beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. Numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness.","  rDev Pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. Head is a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here.

Aroma is sweet malty caramel, vanilla, hints of dark fruit, molasses with a small but detectable hop presence. Taste is less sweet than the promise of the nose: dark malt, fruity fruitcake, molasses and alcohol.

I guess I'll have to Have it again and review it.","  rDev Comes in dark brown. 1/3  head, off white, almost tan. Aroma made no sense, belgian yeast phenols, raisin bread, dark fruit.  Sweet taste counterbalancing the dark fruit bitterness. A little too boozy for its malt bill. This is kind of the quintessential DFH beer, a bunch of shit thrown together that doesn't work, but they get to brand themselves as innovative and unique, despite the fact I'd rather just have a BMC over this thing.","  Pours a dark copper with big foam head and creamy thick lace that displays excellent retention. Fruity aroma with a hint of alcohol. I didn't really smell the raisins, more like some non description dark fruit. The fruity aroma does not come out as much in the taste. Phenolic, grainy, alcohol very present. Full bodied. I felt that this one was not as flavorful as DFH's other offerings. Not their best but I still liked it.","  rDev On tap: Have had this before and was never a big fan, but after done time off I decided to try again. It didn't even live up to its low expectations.  The beer looks just fine, ruby/auburn, quite clear (too much so?), with a nice layer of small bubbles built up. The surface continues to hold the head well into the taste, and lacing is prevalent. Smell is a bit of raisin, but more graham cracker like spice and sweetness.  The taste has some expected strong ale flavors, dark sugar with a hint if molasses, perhaps. There's a hint of copper tinge (that I associate with British bitter beer). I also get a bit of bourbon-poached peach, and almost none if the raisin I expected. There is also a light bite of spice, and an almost equally subdued hops note. More disappointing is the feel - I wanted a bit more body for the lighter flavors I was getting (deeper flavors would've worked as well). The carbonation is also a bigger part of the feel than if expect.  Definitely learned I don't need to try this again, considering the offerings that DFH has. This beer reminds me in its downgrade from previous thinking of how I downgraded the Punkin' Ale.","  rDev I have had this beer many times and like it a lot so I decided to do a full review. Good looking beer that is wonderful to the nose. Very tasty, rich and full, plus bonus points for ABV versus drinkability.

I cellared a lot of beer in 2008/2009 to see what develops and although Dogfish Head is readily available here on the west coast, they stopped distributing Raison D'Être, so I was unable to get another bottle until now. This was not a beer I wanted to put down for more than a year or two, but here goes….. 2013: Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium mahogany amber with a thin, light tan head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass, leaving patchy light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark dried fruit, lightly nutty and earthy. Flavor follows aroma; caramel and bready malt, nuts, raisins, dates, fresh dark fruit. Finishes with an earthy dark maltiness. Medium bodied. A nice domestic take on a Belgian dark beer, closely in character to a dubbel, but sweeter and maltier. Old ale meets dubbel.  2009: Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, medium to dark, red-orange amber with a thin off-white head with good retention and light lacing. Rich aroma of sweet caramel malt, dark dried fruit, light cardboard oxidation, similar in profile to a mild barley wine. I'm surprised to see that the years have been quite nice to this ale! The flavor is moderate, but flavorful caramel and bready malt, mellow dark dried fruit (lots of dates and figs), very well integrated and tasty. Body has turned to the heavy side of medium with light creaminess. This is a very nice, creamy, well melded malty ale that most resembles a light, but well made old ale. I had no great expectations from this, and have found that many ales develop too much oxidation flavors ate this age, but this does not. The oxidation notes in the aroma are not present. Well, I like Raison D'Être and used to pick it up frequently when it was available, but now I wish I had a few more of these in the cellar. I'm going to try to get my sister to haul back a few more. Rating is an average of the two ales; I liked the aged one quite a bit more than the new one, which was still enjoyable.","  rDev 12oz bottle from Total Wine (Kennesaw, GA). 2.29. Bottled 11/12/13.

The advertised beet sugar and raisins seem apparent in the aroma. Sweet sugars, dark fruits and caramel.   A very malt forward beer. Caramel malts, raw natural sugar, dark fruits, toffee, a slightly funky but mellow Belgian yeast element, faint honey and just a trace tickle of alcohol towards the finish. Straight forward but quite approachable.   Medium body with fair carbonation. Toffee, caramel malts and raisins in the aftertaste.   An all around solid brew.

Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Pungent aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Piney.","  rDev Look: It pours golden with a white head that has moderate head retention. It is fairly clear.   Smell: There are aromas of rye, tropical fruit, and pineapple.   Taste: The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor. In addition the flavors are highlighted by some citrus and grapefruit.   Feel: It has a moderate body with a moderately high bitterness. The bitterness is high enough to provide a good bite, without being overpowering.   Overall, this is an excellent ipa highlighted by the rye and tropical flavors with just enough bitterness for a good punch.","  rDev Poured from a howler on the day it was tapped. A vigorous pour produces a thick, creamy, light tan, two finger head on top of an orangish tan, slightly opaque beer. The smell knocks you over with fresh citrus and woody/piney hops. There is also a spiciness to it. The taste is bitter hops resin, and a woody, floral spice. The citrus comes through less on the taste than in the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Overall a great beer I'm happy I had the chance to try. It's a unique flavor.","  I had it on tap at the Dive Bar NYC. It poured an eye catching hazy golden orange color. It had a thumb nail length frothy head that retained nicely. The lacing also retained well and was sticky. In the nose I got a nice scent of citrusy orange peel and grapefruit pith. Next, I became aware of rye bread characteristics. As the drink progresses, I become more aware of herbal and even dank hops characteristics. Overall, quite pleasing to the nose. Going down the hatch, it feels smooth, initially sweet and citrusy. There are some bready and even slightly doughy attributes that provide a nice malt backbone. There is a white wine like dryness throughout. As the drink progresses, a nice moderate hops bitterness that is herbal, spicy and resiny. The body is medium but feels on the light side because it drinks so fast. This is a delicious IPA.","  rDev On tap at a liquor store.  Pours a hazy sunshine gold. Nice white head.  The aroma starts with light rye which pokes through spicy malt and sharp, citrus hops. The dual rye/hop sharpness balances quite well against the barley.  Tastes like it smells: aggressive but very well balanced. Finish is sweet and alcoholic, with lingering honey against the hop resin. A very good high-strength single IPA.","  rDev Appearance - The beer is a murky golden color that showed a big head.   Smell - Rye and citrus hops compose the nose.   Taste - The beer is very rye forward, but it is not over the top. Caraway seeds are almost detectable. The hops come into view with citric tendencies. The hops grow more bitter toward the back.   Mouthfeel - Witg the giant head, I would not expect any carbonation to be left. But there it was.   Overall - This has to be among my favorite rye beers.","  rDev Pours cloudy orange color with bubbles clinging to the glass in the body of the brew, leading up to a 1-2 finger foamy off white head that was full of bubbles of all sizes , dissipating very slowly and leaving very good spotty foamy lacing. Second pour from bottom half brought out a much better head and left foamy rings as it went down.  Smells of pungent lemon zest, red grapefruit, clementine, yuzu and all things lemony, with a potent citrus hop aroma from the Nelson Sauvin. Some biscuit, toasted grains and crackers show up but get pushed aside by peppery spices, dry floral hops and rye. A whiff of coriander peeks through, and there is a good degree of balance, but this is basically all lemon and grapefruit in the nose with a nice helping of rye.  Tastes like it smells with the lemon, red grapefruit, clementine, yuzu and juicy citrus hops jumping all over your palate at first, then allowing some of the malt base to come through with biscuit, toasted grains and crackers. Some soapy fruit aspects like a rotting pineapple or guava come with the taste, along with faint caramel and graham cracker. The finale is the spices, pepper, dry floral hops, rye, coriander and other spices that are peppery like dry floral hops. The rye must be bringing those peppery spices and taming the bitterness a bit, which is still very high and a little too bitter for me. It's complex yet on the basic side, hiding the ABV beautifully.   Mouthfeel is thin and watery with mild carbonation, a medium body that slides down easy due to it's thin nature, and then zaps you with bitterness before fading semi-dry and leaving lemon and toasted grains as the lasting flavors. Overall a very good beer, but I liked Hoppy Birthday and Pure Hoppiness better than this.","  rDev This beer pours a very hazy goldenrod with a large, fluffy head. The aroma offers up strong lemon and lemongrass, caraway seed and some muted pineapple. The flavor is dry and savory, with the caraway and rye bread flavor playing a solid background role to the leading players of the lemony, lemon grass, lemon pepper- pretty much every lemon influenced spice - flavor, the muted, not to sweet tropical notes of pineapple, and a background hint of pine. The mouthfeel is fizzy and full. Overall this is a stellar beer. There was a lot of hype when these bottles came around, but this beer was worth it.","  rDev Poured from 22oz bottle into a dimpled mug.  Appearance: light golden-yellow hue with a moderate haze and a finger of frothy white foam that lasts a decent interval. Attractive!  Smell: brightly piney and grapefruity hops with a nice toasty base. The rye and the prickly hop elements work very well together indeed.  Taste: much like the aroma, pine, grapefruit and maybe a little tangerine are the prominent hop flavors, and the rye adds a bready touch to the finish. What a wonderful beer.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a decent carbonation and an OK creaminess. I don't think you drink Nelson for its texture, though.  Overall: I could see myself drinking a ton of this stuff."]},{"Name":"Xocoveza","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/128500/","Brewery":"Stone Brewing","Style":"Stout - American Imperial","Alcohol":8.10,"Score":96.0,"Comments":["  rDev I've had this fresh and cellared.

Some sort of spiced up malty and coffee aroma fills the vicinity of the action. Although the head doesn't last long, abundant glass lacing bears witness to the ample body. The taste is remarkable, with the sort of good sweetness a good dark chocolate brings. This is one rich brew and it slides down so smoothly.

Ibarra cocoa in the nose - cinnamon, roast barley, and faint black pepper. Low hops, vaguely spicy/herbaceous. Coffee comes forward as the beer warms.  Spices are more forward on the palate, although the cocoa adds a wonderfully rich flavor. Finishes smooth, earthy, and gently bittersweet (while a dessert beer perhaps, this isn't a  pastry stout ). Low bitterness - well balanced, with the coffee emerging as the ale warms.  Medium-light bodied, almost crisp, with a perfectly reasonable ABV.

It is surprisingly light bodied but becomes fuller when it opens up, moderately carbonated, and oddly enough I notice that the longer I hold in a sip, the more spice I get after the swallow  This absolutely blew my mind and my expectations, I am not the biggest stout fan but I can appreciate a well crafted one, and this is just that, my favorite stout to date, I will definitely be picking up a whole sixer of this asap","  rDev DATE: November 1, 2019... OCCASION: Halloween in the rear view, I head to the weekend with something warming and substantial--and last year's winner of Tom's beerfest... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... this looks as black and intimidating as could be... its head is oatmeal brown, single-fingered and settling into a thick ring... wow, the first whiff is of thick nutmeg, cocoa nibs and tootsie rolls, chili powder, cinnamon, medium-roasted coffee beans, and a stiff punch of yeasty heat... dry, thin early before dripping into a roasted coffee mouthfeel, smooth and sippable with a warming texture... its back end is a rush of effervescence and thick froth... this is billed as a holiday welcomer, but it reads well as a Halloween drink, rife with mocha chocolate, roasted coffee, ground root, cinnamon, half and half, vanilla cream, and some sweet heat... this wins as a desertif, strong and singular in its after-dinner heft and flavor... bless Cathy for bringing it, and thanks to Liquor Factory for putting it on tap...","  rDev Reviewed from notes. Poured from the 12 oz. can into a Cycle Brewing goblet.  A: Very dark brown and opaque. Forms a thin light tan head that fades away fairly quickly. At first there's quite a bit of visible carbonation, but it settles out quickly. It looks a little thin while pouring into the glass.  S: Nice – coffee and spicy peppers dominate, but cacao nibs are quite present. Dark roasted malts, vanilla, and cinnamon lurking in the background. Doesn’t smell like a Yankee Candle of a Christmas beer to say the least – things are nicely balanced in here.  T: Cinnamon, chocolate, and coffee all hit at once up front. Significantly more cinnamon than I got on the nose. Some chili peppers with a light roast character, very mild to no heat from them. Light notes of vanilla, cloves, nutmeg. Dry cacao nibs mix with sweet toasted malts. It finishes with a cinnamon mocha sweetness.  M: A medium heft to the body, as long as you remember this is not an Imperial Stout. Average carbonation sensation. Low alcohol flavors, but I do find it a little warming going down.  O: I wish the balance on the tongue was closer to what I got on the nose. The cinnamon and to a lesser extent the nutmeg could be turned down a couple notches each for my preference. Still, a well conceived stout that’s widely distributed in 12 oz. bottles. And a “Christmas” beer that I actually enjoy. Probably not something I’d choose on a regular basis, nor something that’d I’d want more than one of in an evening. But on a cold night around a fire, I could get behind one of these.","  rDev 330ml Can from Brewdog.com: Opaque black, almost oil like with a thumb-sized, bubbly head that's a beige coloured &amp; eventually turns slightly creamy on the surface, fading to settle about a half centimetre tall.

There is much going on in this beer, and yet all is in balance, remarkably and unexpectedly so for the hot peppers.","  rDev Pours an excellent opaque black, although a thinner pour than expected--not much viscosity. Excellent dull-brown head and lacing however.  The nose is an excellent and complex mixture of coffee, cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, and a surprisingly-forward aroma of pasilla peppers. The chocolate and coffee are very forward, with the peppers arrive in midstream, and the spice notes bringing up the rear.  The flavor follows the nose, although not as strong. However, the most impressive part is the presence of the pasilla. It is quite noticeable and warm, but not overbearing. It is well balanced with the rest of the flavors.   The mouthfeel is the most disappointing part of this brew. The carbonation is solid, but it has dry, chalky feel to it. That said, it certainly isn't cloying or sticky like this style can be.

Hefty aroma of fresh-made hot chocolate. Taste brings out the spices, with cinnamon being the most prevalent - exactly as advertised! Smooth and clean with little hint of the 8% ABV. Excellent finish, the taste just slips away intil the next sip. Drink at cellar temperature. Cold will mute the subtle flavors. Highly recommended.","  rDev Canned on 9/21/18  Pours a solid black with a bit over a finger of tan foam; good retention recedes to a thin froth over the surface, and eventually, the edge of the beer, and leaves plenty of sticky lacing to the walls of the glass.  Aromas of chocolate malts and slight roastiness to start, with building notes of cinnamon and nutmeg imbued with earthy, nicely integrated pepper spice through the mid-palate; the bouquet flows rather seamlessly.  Taste brings deep chocolate notes becoming roastier over time, light vanilla bean creaminess, and bits of earthiness and nutmeg spice; mild peppery heat guides the profile through the finish alongside persistent malty smoothness.  Mouthfeel has sturdy, fluffy medium body bolstered delicately by a medium-high carbonation; dryness holds tightly in the background, and peaks in the finish with a char-like crispness which makes this beer feel much lighter than its ABV would indicate.  For all that’s going on here, this one manages to be as subtle and nuanced as it is assertive. Exactly as advertised, and much smoother going down than I expected. For a beer with heat, this is one of the more sessionable, as strange as that may sound for an 8.1%er.","  rDev First time I ever seen it in a can had it before but never reviewed it. Into a tulip. A - As expected very dark pitch even at the base with a great full inch of mocha head. S - Not getting much over the burnt and chocolate malts. Touch of vanilla marshmallow? Nutmeg spice? Can't tell. T - Much better than the smell with an intense pepper burn at first which rounds into more of a cocoa syrup mixed with a good dose of vanilla. Pepper burn is pretty consistent with every sip and it has some healthy bitterness as well with some bittering hops. M - Smooth and thin but I think it's spot on for the style. You want thicker? Go for an imperial stout! This is a nice medium bodied milk stout.  Overall glad to have grabbed two not a whole sixer since halfway through the glass the nutmeg and bittering hops really make it kind of off putting but its still a very well crafted stout.","  rDev Not 100% sure this is still the exact same beer, I'm pretty sure it's not still a collaboration and is just a Stone beer at this point, this is the 2018 edition from a can. Pours a damn sexy midnight black with a thin mocha head that lingers wonderfully Smell is rich and roasty, some chocolate and spice coming through as well. Taste wise there is a lot going on, there is a roasty/charred bitterness that underpins it all but a fiesta de navidad dances over top. Lead by a bright peppery note that is quickly subsumed in a holiday cheer melange dominated by vanilla. chocolate and nutmeg play supporting roles and I can only detect cinnamon in the slightest bit on the tail end, but it might just be the power of suggestion. The mouthfeel might be an asset to some but to me it is a pretty big flaw, it is very thin, it doesn't support the robust flavor well at all, and it verges dangerously close to watery.  Overall this remains a lovely spiced stout but it feels like it has lost some of it's fullness that I remember from earlier batches. The flavor is remarkably complex and pleasant but somehow it doesn't all come together.","  rDev Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, frothy, beige head. Smells of roasted malt, rich milk chocolate, vanilla and nutmeg, with a hint of coffee and cinnamon. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by roasted malt, milk chocolate, vanilla and nutmeg notes, with hints of lactose, licorice, coffee, cinnamon and chili. Finishes with a light bitterness and some chocolate, vanilla and mild chili heat pleasantly lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  Greatly balanced Milk Stout that starts out sweet and chocolately, with the spices coming out more and more, culminating in a mild, pleasant chili heat in the aftertaste. Just a great balance of sweetness, bitterness and spiciness. Maybe a bit too heavy on the lactose though, while I would have also wished for just a bit more chili heat.","  rDev Torn on my opinion on this stout. On the one hand, it is rich and creamy with lots of milky chocolate and smooth buttery vanilla frosting notes. On the other hand, the chili and some of the other spices are almost non-existent. If you told me this was a 6% milk stout, I'd say it was a home run. As an 8.1% Mexican stout, it is missing some key parts. I'd probably buy it again, since I did enjoy it...and that says a lot. But I can't help feel it fell short of (albeit high) expectations. Bottom line, very good but missing something.","  rDev Wow. Had on tap at Jack's/Sodus Point. Rich mocha and spice enhanced in nose and taste. Chilies assist rather than leap out; well integrated subtle pepperiness. Bit of an Imperial Milk Stout from south of the border. Very good mouth feel, but considering style and ABV would have liked something a little smoother and less carbonated. This improved with moving from cold to cool, but never moved to velvety/hot chocolate. Overall a delicious super drinkable stout.","  rDev Canned October 1st.

B- / WORTHY  *** 08/09/18 bottle:  B-","  rDev From the right side of the label:  BOTTLED ON: MAR 10 2017   Appearance: The body is a hazy golden color with a short creamy textured white head. It has good retention and lacing.  Aroma: The aroma is very muted but there is a touch of citrus and a light grain scent.  Taste: I get a pretty strong candy sweetness up front that turns into a strong sweet malt flavor. It is a very addictive flavor to anyone with a sweet tooth. It has a nice mild bitterness that starts toward the middle of the sip and tapers off at the end. There is a nice hop flavor to the beer which seems to be mostly herbal with a touch of orange citrus flavor. and only a light touch of pine mixed with grapefruit in the aftertaste. The flavors combined are really, really good.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is awesome. It is very drinkable and overall it just feels bright on the palate. Great carbonation and bitterness. The body rests in that middle ground between light and medium. The finish is dead center between wet and dry.  Overall: It was a highly enjoyable beer that you never get tired of drinking. It delivers a great sweet malty flavor and a nice herbal hop character with a touch of citrus. At different points while drinking the beer it gives very different experiences and that really does make the beer interesting to drink. It makes you want to go back and sip it again to chase the flavors you picked up on the last sip but then you are met with something else, then something else again. I kept waiting for my palate to adjust but it was constantly surprised by great flavors. The only downside to the beer was the lack of aroma. While it did have some aroma it just wasn't on par with some of the more average beers on the market, which was surprising given the fantastic flavor it had. Overall I would love to drink it again and I would recommend it to people who like any variation of IPAs.","  rDev First had at Wintzell's Oyster House, Orange Beach, AL, poured from 12-oz. bottle into tumbler, and then poured from 12-oz. can into tulip.

Superb!","  rDev Appearance drops in an amberish color, 1/4  white head. Aroma lacked any dry hopping.  Taste was obscured by an excessive amount of carbonation.

But I also reduced the rating substantially because this really is too hoppy for me to drink as a session once my thirst has been initially quenched. The hoppy dryness just takes over. I finished the bottle with some Indian, only because those spices can beat back hops.  I'm glad this recipe put Great Divide on the map... but no more for me.","  Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled on 3/29/16. Pours a beautiful reddish orange, with a 2 finger sticky white head that leaves behind webs and rings of lace.   Smell is apricot, earthy hops, bready, lemon rind, pine, and grapefruit.   Taste follows apricot, biscuit, lemon, pine, and a nice shot of grapefruit, much better than the nose.  Mouthfeel is medium, plenty of life, a little dry, and excellent drinkability.

How have I not rated this already? 22oz bottle served in a stout glass. Beer pours as black as expected and forms a medium brown head. Mild cocoa aroma atop bittersweet chocolate flavor, with just a kiss of hops familiar to an American stout. The chocolate brings up both the levels of bitter and sweet.

I’m sure it was merely an oversight on my behalf, I love Chocolate Stouts, in fact the name of my beer review blog was almost going to be ILCS (I Love Chocolate Stouts) however I Hate Macros seemed a bit of a better fit - it encompassed brews that weren’t specifically Chocolate Stouts and also increased my hits with web users that hate MS Office [you’ll have to think about that one for a moment dear reader]. In any case Rogue, what can I say about them that hasn’t already been said by others? They’re a brewer with more craft pedigree than you can poke a stick at, and one of the few brewers that experiment with weird/wonderful ingredients*, they got moxy.  Poured from a 650ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: “Welcome to the dark side of the beer” I think to myself with Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars’s voice in my head. A delicious inky black body with a 1cm mocha head... and the prize goes to: Rogue! 9/10.  S: Milk chocolate upfront, as it damn well should be, with a solid biscuit malt base, oats, a touch of earthiness, along with some choc-chip cookie for good measure - “I’m going to enjoy this!” (Freddy Quimby from The Simpsons). 9/10.  T: Yep, a solid Chocolate Stout FTW! This is one tasty chocolate brew, though I would recommend letting it warm a little as I drank this fairly chilled and it was muted as a result, but damn: the flavours are there and they’re great; milk chocolate, biscuit malts, oats, cookie, vanilla and a slight roasted/light bitter character towards the end - this is one Stout that spoils you like a kid at Easter. 9/10.  M: Medium bodied with a slightly gassy carbonation. I had a burp, and I shouldn’t with a Stout. This is the only smudge against an otherwise awesome brew. 8/10.  D: Certainly a brew I will be getting again... and again... and again... and possibly again... but after that no more for a while... then just as I think I won’t get it again - I get it again. Rogue Chocolate Stout is up there with Amager Bryghus &amp; Cigar City’s Xiquic as one of my favourite chocolate beers, and praise well-earned that is and indeed high, mmm [I’m doing a Yoda voice now]. 9/10.

Mouthfeel has medium-high levels of carbonation that excellently carry its light-medium body and allowing a certain balanced robustness to flourish somewhere in between; the finish is bright and clean, leaving enough impact on the palate without becoming too overbearing.  Easy-drinking and nicely refined abbey ale that is consistent throughout and maintains a smooth profile throughout; solid Belgian to return to if the mood for a lighter beer strikes.","  rDev 11.2oz bottle bb 3/5/19 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 6.6% ABV. The beer pours bright light golden amber with abundant nearly white head. The aroma is just a touch of yeasty clove and very faint banana. The taste is more of the same with clovey light banana with a touch of pale malt body on the finish. There is no noticeable hop taste, but just enough bitterness to keep the beer from finishing sweet. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied and highly carbonated. Overall, good. I am one who hits a brick wall on banana flavor in a beer. Once I pick up that smell or flavor, any beer becomes one dimensional to me.","  rDev Abbaye de Leffe S.A. Leffe Blonde, 6.6% ABV.

A stupid argument of semantics, but it reminded me I had this in my fridge to try!  Pours a muddy brown with a finger of beige head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  The aroma is balanced between sweetness and phenolic spices, bringing forth notes of banana, soft dark bread, plum, raisin, clove, and white pepper. Surprisingly no boozy aromas for 10.5%  Everything from the aroma translates great into the taste, maybe even slightly better, starting off with notes of juicy plum, caramel, clove, and a slight warming alcohol. On the swallow, I pick up more spice, a really earthy pepper and more clove along with notes of banana, and sweet malt  A medium full body pairs with tingling carbonation for a smooth drink that should be sipped slowly.

Smell is yeast, cloves, grass, toffee, dates.  Taste is pretty sweet -- cloves and toffee come across and a lot of yeast. Also dates. Something sharp cuts the sweetness nicely -- maybe that's more of the flavor of cloves.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, yet still sticky, and nicely carbonated. Overall...this is a very good beer.

Big aromas and flavors of caramel, dark fruit (fig, raisin, prune), a little molasses, and a hint of tart apple. Substantial mouthfeel, with a little lingering sweetness and tartness on the finish. A little alcohol warmth, but not nearly what one might expect from such a big beer.

Head retention is good, but leaves only a thin veil of foam over the top with dense lacing left behind. Aroma is plum, caramel, toffee, raisins, clove, and yeast spice. It smells like a kitchen full of holiday baking goods with a vat of warming dark Belgian beer in the corner. Flavor profile is plum, caramel, molasses, raisins, clove, and yeast spice - again. Lovely sugary flavor profile that doesn't come off as overly sweet. Mouth feel is a touch fizzy and harsh, but carries an otherwise velvety feel within a medium-thick thickness.

Served in a Chimay chalice from a 750mL bottle.","  rDev Very dark caramel color. Thick creamy body with almost champagne like carbonation,overall really nice feel.

Anyways, pours a light amber color with a thin white but not virgin white color that is thin and around 1/4  deep. The smell kicks down a hot alcohol burn, some caramel and apple notes.  Taste still drops the apple notes and the alcohol burn is still the most prominent thing about the beer. Every time I've had this, I have always wondered why such punishing alcohol gets a pass taste and mouth feel wise from people. It is really oppressive, there isn't much in the way of other flavors to help carry it. Its like those hot sauces that are just hot, that provide little other flavor to it. Once you get as accustomed as you can to the heat, you can pick up notes of raisin and other dark fruit from the yeast profile.   Sorry I can't endorse this beer. Typical American.","  rDev ** 01/10/18  I know I had this several time sin the past, but just never rated it,  12 oz. Bottle to snifter.

Light cinnamon. Maybe a hint banana. TASTE: Apple cider, raisin, Rum or brandy presence and high abv give this a very warming finish. FEEL: Full body and thick. A healthy supply of carbonation as well.   Great winter beer.   **","  rDev Poured from cork and cage bottle into tulip glass. It pours a cloudy, orange-cola color with a huge, fluffy, khaki-colored head and lacing with amazing retention. The nose features cola, toffee, candied apple, and molasses. It's highly fragrant. It's quite sweet with lots of toffee and molasses, brown sugar, red wine notes, and discernible alcohol. There is a slight dry bitterness in the after taste. It has a rich, creamy mouth feel with only moderate carbonation, and the 10.5% ABV is noticeable. Overall, I understand why Gulden Draak is so highly regarded. It's well-crafted and highly flavorful but a little too sweet for my taste. It's a good dessert sipper but I wouldn't recommend it for casual drinking.","  rDev Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) white bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information.

Alcohol notable (how could it not be) but has almost a brown rum quality. Very little bitterness evident. M: Full bodied with very pleasantly persistent effervescence evident. The bubbliness continues throughout consumption. O: Wow! This is a really top of class beer.

The higher ABV was very well-hidden, however.","  rDev Probably an unfair rating because it's over three months old.","  rDev 7/1/17...pours rich copper with heavy white foam. Creamy layer, malty hoppy nose. Toffees. Heavy hearty bitter. Thick layered mouthfeel. Chewy. Almost woodsy. So fresh and absolutely outstanding.","  rDev I have several Great Divide bottles hanging around &amp; what with today being NBS (Week 653), I decided to make this the last (for now) beer in my latest brewery horizontal. There is an upside to The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody &amp; the opportunity to conduct &amp; CANduct such horizontals is it. Amazingly, this one is a CANQuest (tm) entry!  From the CAN:  Great Minds Drink Alike ; On the reverse side of the CAN, a circus strongman hefts a massive barbell with one hand, all in silhouette. Stunning graphics!   A month-old CAN?!? That kind of freshness CAN only mean one thing - an inverted Glug, following the Crack! The finger of dense, foamy, light-tan head quickly formed &amp; began to fall away, leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = &gt; 9, &lt; 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled cool and minty, like standing in the middle of a pine forest during a snowstorm. Actually, there was some caramel malt in the mix, but the hops were prevalent. Mouthfeel was big, thick, viscous &amp; if I thought that the earlier Hibernation was hot, this erupted like a flamethrower in my mouth! Phew. This was no playin' around time. The taste was really cool and minty and when coupled with the inherent heat, I felt like I had been gargling with it. Minty fresh &amp; eye-opening. The malt had not yet begun to come forward as further proof of its freshness, but I did get a subtle nuttiness as mentioned in the  Notes/Commercial Description  section, like peCANs or almonds. Man, this was tasty! Dangerously so as I sucked down half of the CANtents without a moment's hesitation or a seCANd thought. I suddenly found myself slumped backwards in my chair, a clear sign that I should take my foot off of the gas. The cool, minty heat rendered it very dry on the finish &amp; while it would probably smooth out with age, it should probably be CANsumed fresh.","  rDev Amber with a nice head and hoppy aroma. A very nice malty base upon which the hops provide a balanced flavor profile. This is a very enjoyable example of a DIPA.","  rDev From the right side of the bottle:  BOTTLED ON: MAR 09 2017   Appearance: The body is a dark copper color. It is opaque but large chunks of sediment are visible in the form of dark shadows. The head is short and white which quickly recedes to a white ring leaving no lacing.  Aroma: There is a light caramel and malt scent with a bit of pine.  Taste: It has a nice malty backbone which is apparent from start to finish. Up front the beer has this slightly sweet malt flavor which transitions into a grainy taste at the end. The malt flavor is very good. Accompanying the malt is a bitter pine flavor which is fairly strong. It is important to note that while the beer boasts  10.0% ALC. BY VOL.  on the label the alcohol is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel: It has bright carbonation and a sharp, strong bitterness. The beer has a medium body and although there is sediment visible in the glass it has a clean finish.  Overall: It is a pretty standard Double IPA without any bells or whistles but that is what is enjoyable about the beer. It tastes the way one would expect a Double IPA to taste. One element that brings this beer out of the average rank and file of other Double IPA beers is the nice grain flavor in the finish. Another element that is noteworthy is the clean mouthfeel that delivers an exceptionally pointed bitterness. Although I wasn't a fan of the loads of sediment in the beer I would still drink it again and I would recommend it to others. Just ignore the sediment and let the flavor do all the talking.","  rDev 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/19/2017. Pours crystal clear medium orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, pear, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, caramel, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, pear, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, caramel, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, pear, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready/sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a great DIPA! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink, despite the aggressively bitter/drying finish. Great juicy hop complexity with a sizable malt backbone that is never overly sweet/heavy feeling. A very enjoyable offering.","  rDev Hazy orange gold with lots of particular matter. Head is three fingers of pale bone color head that lasts a good ten minutes. Rings and swathes of fine bubble lace. Smell is pungent sweet malts and resinous hops. Taste is sweet bready malts with piney hop oil bitterness. A strong element of dankness rises up after the liquid warms. Mouthfeel is medium with proper caronation levels. Finish is medium dry and bitter. Overall another big DIPA. A good beer for those that do not like all the fruity aspects of others of this style.","  rDev 12oz. canned on Jan 03, 2017  Pours hazy amber dark orange with a creamy frothy white foam head.

Taste hits the high 90ibu bitter notes, lots of hefty malt here, crystal malt, english pale malt, two row it seems. Lots of grapefruit. Straddles barleywine territory for sure. Bitterness is definitely the first and last thing you grasp on this one. Not as boozy as it smells.   Enjoyable but you better be ready for the big bitter time.

Deliciously sweet, with some between orange and pineapple that feels very refreshing. Dangerously drinkable. ABV very hidden","  rDev Very good dipa. Full of character. A bit boozy. Floral, piney and citrusy. A bit sweet but not cloying. Warming alcohol. Quite balanced even with the high bitterness","  rDev Dark copper brew, almost perfectly clear.  Big malty, hoppy, sweet aroma. Orange juice and pine; brown sugar and bread.  Big dose of caramel malt up front, immediately followed by a wave of juicy citrus. Toast follows, and the brew finishes with pine and peel.  Fairly thick and cloying. It's a big DIPA, and drinks like it.","  rDev A: Pours a dark amber/copper color with 2 fingers of head that slowly fades down to a decent cap that leaves some soapy lacing  S: Huge earthy and fruity hop notes collide with nutty caramel malts that somehow all balance together. No alcohol noticeable  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the earthy tones of the hops and nuttiness of the malts an slowly takes a woody tone overall. Fruity notes emerge after the nutty notes and woodiness fades a little. Moderately bitter throughout, but the caramel sweetness and alcohol all co-mingle extremely well together. Finishes with lingering nutty notes and some fruity alcoholic esters  M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation  O: Definitely not your typical citrusy, fruit driven DIPA. This melds so well together between the earthy hop tones, sweet nutty maltiness, and alcohol and is one to sit down and sip on given the strength alone. Definitely worth a shot if you're looking for something other than your typical DIPA","  rDev 1001","  rDev (bottle date Aug 27 2015... poured into a Chouffe tulip)  L: tall tan head atop richly amber-hued, hazy liquid, good bit of flaky sediment floating about... foam is open-structured and spongy, bouncing as I lift the glass  S: weak booze, at first, which eventually peaks out a bit more as it warms and the foam recedes... smells aged - bold caramel, faint leafy-minty-citrus-rind-y hops... very familiar West Coast, earthy-piney-zesty aromas - nothing unique... potency fair-good  T: richly malty, blanketed in the whispers of dying resins... notable medicinal swell in the finish, as well as a latent rise of tea-like, tannic bitterness... upon second sip, hop character much more apparent - bitterness enhances, more lemon zest... more into it, the citrus flavors become more intense, while the bitterness fails to abate, and a brown bread crust note lingers in the back  F: any body felt on the palate could likely be from the resins, as this drinks pretty darn soft and light, but not quite crisp, smooth but maybe only mildly viscous  O: I've had this rather fresh, and the hop flavors are naturally brighter and the overall taste sharper, but this is far from dull in this state, the alcohol and bitterness surely aiding in its lasting triumph... I'd say it even tastes more like a hop-forward West Coast barleywine... it'd be interesting to let this age for a year or two, let the malt come out a little more - the bitterness is bold and beautiful, and I doubt it would tail off much (which is fine with me)","  rDev Bottling date of 10/22/15  Appearance - Pours slighty hazy and amber in color with an off-white head that peaks at just over a finger's width. Good retention, eventually settling to a thin, broken layers of suds across the surface. Lacing consists of a thick sheet with lines breaking off and streaking down the side of the glass.  Smell - Ruby red grapefruit, light pine, mango and some light biscuit maltiness arounds out the aroma.  Taste - Lots of mango flavor upfront, with a touch of banana peel. There's an underlying grapefruit pith bitterness which emerges strongly toward the finish. Malts are present, but hard to pinpoint a distinct flavor, lending instead a rather generic sweetness. The finish is bittersweet, with the aforementioned mango/grapefruit aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Full in body with low to moderate carbonation. Goes down well enough, with a light touch of astringent dryness.  Overall - A solid all-around DIPA. Nicely balanced and the hop bill has a fairly unique twist on the citrus heavy style. One I would likely buy again given the chance.","  rDev A wonderful DIPA. Great mix of hop. Pine, citrus, along with funky goodness. Th malt do smammice job of bringing it all together. I should have brought home a bomber!","  rDev A very solid beer.","  A: Pours an amber gold with a minimal amount of head, but that small amount lasts quite a while. When the head does break, there is some nice lacing left behind.  S: Malts right off the bat, the sweet caramel notes are noticed immediately. After a breath or two the hops really works its way in: Piney and floral. These aromas blend nicely together.  T: The taste follows the nose closely. Malts are definitely on the front end here, but the hops meld in so smoothly that there is no harshness to their being there.   M: There is a full-bodied feel to this beer with medium carbonation. At times the beer can be a touch thick/syrupy in feel, but it does not take away from the enjoyment.  O: Hercules impresses me. I really enjoyed how the malts and hops blended nicely in this beer to create a nice enjoyable beer experience."]},{"Name":"Rodenbach Grand Cru","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/216/673/","Brewery":"Brouwerij Rodenbach N.V.","Style":"Sour - Flanders Red Ale","Alcohol":6.00,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Translucent deep brownish-red, with light, quickly-dissipating tan head.

Dry and taxing, this is not one I groove to, but it’s alright.","  rDev 3/1/21....pours medium copper amber with light head of off white foam. Cherry fruit and yeasty nose. Spicy fruity flavor. Some cherry. Black currants too. Deep and powerful body. Leaves with an earthy gritty bitter. Solid.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Clear orange colour, big off-white head. Lovely strong aroma of fruity and piney American hops, notes of oranges and slightly caramellized orange marmalade. The flavour is a hoppy explosion from start to finish, fruity (orange marmalade) first, very bitter in the end. There is a considerable malty sweetness that stands up to the bitterness. I don’t get many  Belgian  notes out of this  Belgian IPA , it is all very American to me.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Best by date is stamped on label as '05:23:21'. Mostly clear, medium amber colored body. One thin finger of white head recedes to thin cap. Leaves some partial lacing walls away from the drinking side. Aroma of Belgian yeast, with hint of toasted malt and piney hops. Taste is up front with piney hops, with a good malt base and an expression of the Belgian yeast. Also has some sweeter tropical fruit hops that emerge late. Aftertaste goes to a sweet mellow place with a blend of the main components. Both the initial flavor push and the end game are tasty, although with different emphasis and balance. Medium mouth feel, with a bit of syrup. Very good carbonation. There is some piney bitterness but not to a burn or stinging experience. All components get to present and together they work well in a blend and balance. Flavorful IPA, and more distinct because of the yeast smell and taste. Wild side art work on the label.","  rDev From the growler via Sunoco Amelia (!!!!!) in a snifter. This fine  coulda' swore I reviewed ya'  brew pours a nice peach tinged  pale amber with a fantastic head of white foam that settles to a thick ring and layer with excellent lacing. Nose of mango, pineapple, herbal hops, pine hops, and honey sweet malts. Flavors follow but surpass by presentation with caramel malts, pineapple, mango, papaya, light yeasty notes of fresh bread, and pine hops. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light carbonation that is soft and lightly creamy, and a bitter hop yet subtly sweet finish that is moderately dry.  Overall, I enjoyed it years ago and still dig it for a nice change of pace!  Cheers","  rDev Best by 11/4/20...Shit  Even though it's a bit past freshness (my fault for neglecting it for so long), this is still my first Belgian IPA. What the hell does that mean anyways? A yeast forward IPA? Oh well. This seems to be the flagship example of the style, though not exactly the highest rated  Pours a clear orange amber with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves patchy lacing  Honestly the aroma reminds me of a Belgian pale, and that might be due to the hops having faded. I pick up notes of lemon, toast, pepper, bubblegum esters, dirty wheat, and grassy hops  The taste starts off sharp and slightly bitter, with notes of lemon, pepper, and piney hops. The swallow brings notes of clove, doughy pale malt, and grassy hops  A surprisingly light feel for the abv. Medium bodied with fine carbonation for a very crisp beer. Finishes dry and almost sparkling. Probably the best part of the experience  This was honestly nothing mind blowing, even for my first of he style. Like I said, it is essentially a Belgian pale, just with more hops. Though I assume they've faded significantly with time. I'd try it again, it would probably go good with food","  rDev L- The lable is surprising in several ways, 1) it's unexpectedly explicit especially for an American beer, 2) it's by the Welsh artist Ralph Steadman, friend of Hunter S. Thompson &gt; 'Fear &amp; Loathing...' etc, album sleeves for The Who, Frank Zappa etc etc, the man is prodigious!; and 3) it features my ex-wife, yes really! Phew, and after that latter thought I'm certainly ready for a bit of an afternoon 'stiffener' of a beer. S- Seems to be a blend of spice and fruit. It's notably aromatic (spice) but perfumed (fruit) as well. T- Ok, I sipped and pre-winced in preparation... tic... toc... tic. It's not as lethal as expected. The perfumed aspect seem the more prominent in the taste now. It's somewhat dry and fully in balance it's neither OTT or at all challenging - note I'm not into mega or majorly over-prominent hopping. F- It's big, deep, pungent, and has a minor zingy hop flourish in the finish. But it has richness balanced down in there too. Nothing is over-prominent vs the whole, I like it more than anticipated. O- Apparently Raging Bitch refers to the hops used and how they 'rage' and foam like... one. For a beer somewhat hoppier/dryer than my usual picks it's very drinkable. The solid meat of this 8.3% sized package tames the bitchier side of the hops. The Bitch continues yielding prodigious head, most satisfying too.  Bought from BeersOfEurope/UK for home delivery. 330ml bottle BB: 28/05/2021. £3.45","  rDev Clear light amber, dense off-white head, good retention and lace Citrus and light pine hops, a bit of fruity esters and peppery phenolics Light citrus and juicy fruits, spice and pine mingle. Really nice interplay between hops and yeast over a rich, caramel malt background.  Pretty dang dry and drinkable for the richness of malt, good carbonation Definitely not something I would drink every day, but very well done.","  rDev Not a bad ale which blended Belgian and IPA aspects quite well. “Enjoy by 5/4/20” printed on bottle. Pours a medium amber color with some fluffy white head and some spotty lingering lacing. Smells of lighter Belgian yeast, malt, vanilla, bread, caramel, faint muddled fruity and piney hops, maybe some very faint banana and clove. Taste follows the nose, decent balance. Mild bitter hit from some grapefruit and lemon tasting citrus hops. Quite refreshing and nice, smooth mild slightly thin mouthfeel and good carbonation. Not too shabby at all.","  rDev Drinking this at home, out of a bottle poured into a pint glass. Appears amber slightly hazy. Smells more Belgian than IPA, malty bready, floral,  Taste clove, banana, a little sweet. Mouth feel, creamy, oily, medium plus. Overall this bitch is pretty damn good, I'd like to try it on a fresh tap.","  rDev Curious that this has the clarity of an IPA, but it's a good-Looker. Smells offer mostly malt. With Tastes, the bitter hops take over and never let Belgian yeast complexities take over. (Complexity may be there, but my buds have taken a defensive position.) I think this finishes a little better as my buds eventually transcend the hop-assault.  I respect most second generation crafters and Flying Dog is not excepted, despite being on the crazy side . But, I wish they had made this beer with fewer bitter hops and, quite possibly, less bitterness to imbalanced women.","  rDev Appearance – This one gave off a moderate white head that lacked the livelihood of a good Belgian Ale. The body was brownish-orange, darker than I expected.  Smell – The nose is rather flat with some toasty male and little hops, again not what I was expecting.  Taste – The malts are just as big at the taste and the hops almost an afterthought.  Mouthfeel – This is the one big positive of the ale. The light, fluffy sensation on the tongue was well done and in line with the style and there was some good drying throughout.  Drinkability – I really enjoyed drinking this ale but it was definitely off-style.","  rDev Clear amber in color with some rising bubbles and a tight creamy white head. Good retention and streaks of lacing. Smells like ripe banana, clove, toast, pink bubblegum, blood orange/ruby red grapefruit, and a hint of pine. Smells mostly Belgian, with a hint of the hops. The taste leans more IPA, with the Belgian behind it. Banana, toast, pink bubblegum, clove and hay upfront, and then a massive hint of blood orange, ruby red grapefruit, grapefruit peel and pith, and pine needle. A nice grapefruit peel bitterness runs in tandem with the dry spicy finish that lingers of hay and pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is medium, slick and oily, well carbonated; slightly resinous from the hops with a bite of fizzy carbonation that scrubs the palate clean and dry. Overall, really nice. Is this one of the OG American Belgian IPAs? I'm not sure, but this is a great benchmark of the style.","  rDev 12oz bottle, best by 03-18-19. Served in a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Mostly clear amber beer, with just a tiny bit of haze. Thin white head, with lots of fine lacing all over the glass.   Smell: Tropical fruit, orange, lemon.   Taste: Quite bitter. Lemon, citrus rind, herbal/leafy hops, some underlying bready malt. A bit unbalanced, but it does have some of that Belgian character to it with some underlying berry and fruity esters and yeast notes.   Mouthfeel: Good thickness, good carbonation, quite sticky on the teeth - a bit aggressive with the hop oils.   Overall / Drinkability: Very strong for a Belgian IPA in hop flavor. Hits the style, but is a bit of a palate wrecker. One is enough.","  rDev Pours a very slightly cloudy amber with a one inch white head that left decent lacing. Smells more like a wit beer than an IPA with notes of banana, Belgian yeast, floral notes and sweet malts. Tastes of bready malts, bananas, Belgian yeast, grapefruit, lemon, floral notes and a bit of spice. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, very mild bitterness, smooth mouth feel.","  rDev ** 12/02/2018  Bottle to snifter.  LOOK: deep clear orange. Big frothy off-white head. AROMA: belgian yeast, apricot, banana, allspice, lemon. TASTE: citrus, banana, with some lemon and pine mixed in. Baking soda finish. Flavors are a bit disjointed. FEEL: light to medium body. good carbonation and a touch smoothy/creamy feel.   Pretty good. Interesting blend of Belgian/Hoppy. I'd call it 75% Belgian.   **","  rDev A beautiful beer. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Creamy white head and great lacing, golden brown body. Funky fruit smell. Taste of Belgian Saison, funkiness and pleasant earthiness. I would get this again.","  rDev Dark copper colored with an inch of creamy tan head on top. The aroma is that sweet candy like Belgian triple yeast. I'm tasting that sweet Belgian triple yeast which dominates the flavor and aroma. The mouth is very dry and moderately carbonated.","  rDev Raging Bitch Belgian-Style IPA brewed by Flying Dog Brewery, with an ABV of 8.30%. This Belgium IPA pours out a deep golden Amber color almost copper in color. This brew also has a nice white head to it. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of Raging Bitch is rich with hop bitterness, and earthy grains and malts. There is alot going on in this IPA. This IPA has the look and smell of most ipa's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold with hop bitterness. There is alot of hops and earthy grains in this brew. The body of Raging Bitch Belgian-Style IPA is medium to heavy. If you are not a fan of his this is not a brew for you. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.30 % ABV in this IPA. This brew just goes down that smooth. The month feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Raging Bitch Belgian-Style IPA a 4.00 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Flying Dog Brewery, did a super nice job with this brew.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Clear golden copper pour. Thick foamy white head. Tons of sticky lacing.  S: Citrus and lemon. Some Belgian yeast notes... hops and grapefruit.  T/F: A nice take on the Belgian IPA. Toasted grains and Belgian yeast. Banana and citrus... refreshing... spicy... caramel sweetness... grapefruit and nice hop bitterness. Relatively light-bodied. Solid carbonation... the finish is citrus and yeast.  O: A very solid Belgian IPA. Great combination of flavors that play nicely together. By far the best beer I've had from this brewer.","  rDev This beer pours a bright gold with a medium sized head. The aroma is quite tropical, with pineapple, mango, kiwi, tangerine, banana, clove, and bubblegum. The flavor starts sweet and inviting, with banana, bubblegum,, then mango, pineapple, with a mildly bitter and caramelly sweet finish. The mouthfeel is fairly full with abundany carbonation. Overall A really solid and fun beer - nothing serious, but quite tasty.","  rDev Bottle impression:  C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE","  rDev A: Pours a relatively clear medium to dark orangish amber in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and moderate copper + golden yellow colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a few small to medium sized patched of medium thick film surrounded by a large patch of thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Moderate aromas of citrus/grapefruit, pine, and earthy hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of toasted + pale malts and a light aroma of spicy Belgian yeast.  T: Upfront there is a light to moderate flavor of toasted + pale malts with a light amount of caramel sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of spicy Belgian yeast. Finally there is a slightly stronger than moderate flavor of citrus/grapefruit, pine, and earthy hops which impart a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness.   M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with a hint of dryness in the finish.  O: Easy to drink , enjoyable, and a very nice example of the style. Alcohol is well hidden and I could easily have a couple of these though it has been years since I had it.","  rDev Deep amber can pour with 3 cm of foam. Orange and a whiff of alcohol in the nose. The flavor is bready malt and candi sugar, dosed with pine-hops. The mouthfeel is full. Alcohol is noted in the finish. I like this, but it lacks the dryness and complexity of others of this style.","  rDev Poured to a teku glass.  A: The body is coppery, having hints of brown, red and bright orange. The head is white having a third part of a finger thickness. There's some visible carbonation. Great lacing. S: The aroma is funky, not funky as sour funky but funky as you get a big giant belgian yeast profile, followed right after with a hoppy aroma. Belgian IPAs are something I'm not used to, mostly because I think they do a bad job at what they propose themselves to, and this Raging Bitch, even with a singularly good aroma, doesn't make it for me, you really have to chose between one and another. T: Cheers. The taste begins with a big belgian candi profile, followed right after with a very biscuit-y profile. Never had a beer that such an accented biscuit profile. I'd say it's a bit too much. For the end of the sip, there's some very light tartness but the beer ends with a partially dry taste of hops and belgian yeast. It's like all these flavours separated could do greater things. But all together, it's makes really no sense at all. M: Body is medium. Carbonation is good. Alcohol content goes unnoticed. Bitterness is mild but ends with a bad touch - the biscuity profile blends with the resinous hops and the belgian yeast and creates a unpleasant aftertaste. You can't have sweet, sour and bitter in the aftertaste. Chose one, go for it. O: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts? Not in this case.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a Weissbier vase; no production information. A: Pours an inviting very clear, amber color with a one inch, eggshell white head.  Very good retention and significant Belgian lacing. S: Bread and orange citrus aromas. T: Biscuit and pine flavors.  Mild bitterness that persists through the end of swallow. M: Medium bodied, persistent effervescence. O: A credible version of the IPA style.  Not terribly complex, but I enjoyed it and would have it again.","  rDev I get how this is consider as a belgian IPA. Even if it's hop driven, the yeasty esters have a big part in this beer. Caramel is present in the smell and taste. Some grain too like caramelized wheat. Pine, grapefruit, grass, pineapple, apple.  All right beer but nothing over the top and a bit unbalanced","  rDev This is one I thought I had reviewed years ago. Kind of popular around here, but I never really got it. Pours a huge wet head that fades quickly. Nose is yeasty with herbs and medicinal hops.   The yeast covers everything in the taste, and when the hops break out later in the sip, they are smothered in the same yeastiness, evoking a combination of metal and soap. The aftertaste is particularly astringent. Not really my cup of tea."]},{"Name":"Miller High Life","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/105/580/","Brewery":"Miller Brewing Co.","Style":"Lager - Adjunct","Alcohol":4.60,"Score":64.0,"Comments":["  rDev To style or...?","  rDev 24oz can. Stamped on can bottom is best by date of 'DEC2021'. Clear, straw colored body. First pour brought forth a multi finger white head, which receded back to a thin skiff. Left behind an extensive pattern of lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and corn. Similar to a perfume. Taste of slightly sweet malt and corn. Slight floral hops. Completely drying in the aftertaste, that calls for another sip or quaff. Thinner mouth feel, but crisp. Good carbonation. Leaves no memory of what has just been imbibed. Just repeat and take another quaff. No real alcohol presence, but induces the burps. Drink cold and get a crisp, quick experience.","  rDev It's a crystal clear golden. You don't need to pour it out to see how crystal clear this is. It's got bright white head. It's a good looking lager. I'm drinking this out of a forty and it's my first forty since college which...checks calendar...was 10 years ago.   This smells takes me back to mornings after hosting pregame at our house in college by East Quad. We would obviously pregame beer pong and other  fun  games and cans of beer, full, half drank, and empty would be scattered through out our living and dining rooms. High Life smells like that. There's nostalgia, pride, and shame.   It's incredibly smooth and that's the first thing that stands out to me. It's malt driven, there's a little cooked rice, and sweet with a Karo corn syrupy finish. It's honestly a pleasant beer to drink and I understand why all of my industry friends like it.","  rDev From a 16oz can:  Appearance: Clear yellow gold, huge head.  Smell: Mild breadiness.  Taste: Moderately sweet to start, a little corn. A little fruitiness as it warms up. Somewhat sweet throughout.  Overall: Wanted a lager for drinking while watching football and realized I had never reviewed the High Life. Nice sweetness (but not too sweet), more body than Miller Lite but still easy drinking. Cheers!","  rDev The pour of a 12 ounce can into a clear pint glass brings these results: It’s a light amber color, plenty of carbonation and not very opaque. There's a slight smell of yeast and malts. Surprisingly there is some white head produced and far more glass lacing than could be expected. The taste is starchy sweet without much character, but there are far worse versions of this style. It's light on the palate, so there are times this could actually refresh.","  rDev Miller High Life @ 5.0% , served from a 341 ml bottle at many a house/holiday/grad party's of the early 80's at the rich boyz house's in Saanich/Gordon Head/Oak Bay … ah my growing up years","  rDev Can best by July 2020: Nice clear golden body in glass from a water-like clear pour. Head builds nicely, and falls the a sheath across the top of the beer. Nose is corn, cereal, light fruit (gape?) and grass. Taste is cereal grain and light grass to spicy hops, initially. The beer seems balanced until it warms, and then is becomes sweeter and the corn adjunct becomes more obvious. Clean, but gets a tad sweet as it warms. Carbonation is medium high.  If I drink it fast enough, it's a fair beverage. But it devolves as it warms, which takes my enjoyment of this beer down below the individual components.","  rDev Crystal clear straw, very bubbly; an aggressive pour yields a fluffy white head. Excellent retention and lacing for an AAL.  Smells like cracker, corn, light grass and hay, and mineral water.  Tastes like oyster cracker and hay upfront, quickly sliding into sweet canned corn with a faint undertone of grass and white pepper. Very minerally and metallic. Crisp and clean with the sweetness just slightly dominating.  Light mouthfeel, highly carbonated, clean and lightly sweet.  One of the best of the macro AALs. Inoffensive with a touch of perceptible hops.","  rDev A: The beer is crystal clear golden yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high dense white head that died down but never completely faded away. S: Light aromas of corn adjuncts are present in the nose along with notes of grainy malts. T: The taste follows the smell, except that the corn adjuncts aren't nearly as prominent. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: For an adjunct lager, I thought this beer wasn't that bad because it wasn't super adjuncty and it had a nice and clean mouthfeel. This would make for a good lawnmower beer, especially if it was served ice cold.  Serving type: can","  rDev Drinking this out a bottle at a friend's house. Looks clear gold. Smells lightly malty. Tastes clean, smooth, light malt. Water flavored beer? Better than a Corona, not as good as a Dos Equis Amber, or even a Tecate. Mouth feel is light. Overall, I would Drink one again if that was all I had, and not as bad as I remembered.","  rDev Pours a translucent golden-honey with two fingers of dense, snow white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is spicy, zesty, herbal hops with dry wafery, crackery malts for support. Flavor profile is lightly dry, hitting notes of bready, wafery, crackery malts and herbal, spicy hops. There is a kiss of bready yeast. Mouth feel is medium-thin with a strong crispness. Overall, crisp and refreshing with a dry, but firm, flavor profile.   Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can.","  rDev If beer were brewed in armpits, Miller High Life would have captured the smell. Bubbly slightly bitter water, is minimized by the offputting smell. If this had electrolytes, it might make a great post-exercise drink. It would also be practical if you did not want the taste of a beer to overshadow the taste of your food. Like Fabreeze, it may also be good for covering up more offensive smells.","  rDev Pours a clear golden yellow with a fresh white head. ,Smell is corn,grain and lemon grass. Taste had light grassy hops with cereal,malts,grain . A crisp and sweet mouth feel very quenchable. Thia is an AAL and is rated as one Hamms and Pabst being my favorites this one in right behind.","  rDev Out of a bottle in hell, or close - Blondie’s bikini bar Saloon in Orange, CA.  I don’t need to pour the damn thing out because it’s transparent through the beautiful clear bottle. Yeah, aroma? Think like Pepe Le Peu’s ass meets Pluto’s toilet after a bender. This thang is rank. Taste actually isn’t all that bad. I mean, if you like beer that tastes like cardboard. It’s stale like the granny that served you your breakfast at Denny’s.   All this being said, I’m not hurting, you know? Like, who wants to hurt? Not Raul. So, yeah. It’s ok like a walk in the shade - I’m ok with that.","  rDev Pours an an incredibly clear dehydrated piss yellow with ample effervescence streaming. The pour produces a four finger, white, soap bubble froth which recedes to a nice surface cap with a central dense island leaving behind a thick frosty lacing. Aroma is light, white bread and a nice floral hoppiness. Hints of egg white backing up corn. Taste bread and cereal, honey and light lemon. Distinctively  corny  and pleasantly sweet. Nice and clean. Aftertaste is a lingering cereal, honey and hints of lemon and bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with moderate carbonation, clean and cridp. A good example of an American adjunct lager. A nice, simple and unsophisticated brew for days end when you are hot and tired and don't want to have to think.","  rDev Pale gold with a short fuzzy white head.  This is very much more corn forward than Lite, with additional notes of white bread and a hint of grape. The tingly soft medium body crisps up and lives up to the self-made Champagne moniker, as it gives a little bite on the semi-wet swallow, while also not finishing as dry as I'd expect.  If these are my only two options, I just prefer Lite.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; best by October 21, 2019. A: Pours a crystal clear, light golden color with champagne-style bubbles, a frothy, white, one finger head, solid retention, and fluffy rings lacing. S: Aromas of sweet white corn on the cob, biscuit, grasses and grains. T: Semisweet to my palate (which surprised me). Palate follows the nose closely. Very light bitterness, just enough. M: Light bodied with light, but steady carbonation overall. O: Dad always kept MHL in the fridge, for football games on the weekend or guests, but never rated/reviewed. I can definitely see why. Nostalgia may play a subtle role, although in fairness it was my Grandfather that used to slip me some when I was young, but I found it to be a light, slightly sweet, and refreshing lager. A  champagne  among beers? Perhaps. I score it for what it is and not for what it is not, i.e a  big flavor  beer.","  rDev Best by 8/5/19  Pours a crystal clear deep gold body with virtually no head formation beyond the slight white cap which fades quickly to a light but frothy collar; a healthy smattering of spotty, thin lacing is thrown around the walls of the glass.  Aromas of crisp straw and light corn sweetness are apparent upfront, with a mild barnyard hay showing with further nosing; grassy hops toward the back end ‘pop’ a bit and contribute a nicely structured depth.  Taste is mildly sweet with corn and grain along with a certain toasty malt note; zippy hops again make an appearance to add a grassy touch to the overall profile.  Mouthfeel is light-bodied with above-average levels of building carbonation resulting in an inconsistent but not overwhelming prickle on the palate; otherwise, relatively dry and crisp with malt on the tongue, leading into a mild but incredibly quenching finish where grassy hops yet again show a spark.  Ever-drinkable with decent, inoffensive flavors and an even temperament across that palate; an effortless AAL that’s about everything I’d want from a ‘macro’.","  rDev This pale and thin brew was the first beer I consumed in late childhood, and while at the time I thought it was awesome, I’ve learned otherwise since then. Having it again in college - I could not quite finish it!","  rDev 5/8/19 (Chicago): $5 draft pitcher poured into pint glass at Edison Park Inn. Clear thin blond straw pour, light white head and lacing. Nominal corn aroma and taste. Thin mouthfeel clean crisp drinking, easy drinking.

I know some folks love to hate it just because it's not craft beer, but I think it's pretty damn enjoyable when you just want a straight ahead beer that's easy to drink and doesn't break the wallet. Pours clear golden color with active carbonation and a good head. Lot's of lacing down the glass to the end. Yeasty, malty, goes really well with food. I bought more of it, it's really a pretty nice change occasionally from the heavier beers I tend to favor. Despite being a macro, it's a well made and enjoyable beer. Better than some of the craft pilsners I've tried. YMMV","  rDev ** 12/21/2018  Bottle to snifter. Picked up 2-6 packs of ponies just to have these around.

Better than Budweiser for what that is worth.   **","  rDev Very nice example of the AAL style. Had out of the bottle. Aroma is subtle, with cracker, white bread and grassy hops.

Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.9%. Overall this is an excellent smoked American porter style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/smoked malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. It’s unfortunate that this one is being retired this year, but at least the homebrew recipe will always be available. A very enjoyable offering.","  A deep brown pour with a tan head, 1/2 . Aroma goes roast heavy, minor smoke, usual Stone Chinook hops.   Taste is a porter similar to Sierra Nevada and Black Butte, its plenty hoppy, I probably should have mentioned Alaskan Smoked Porter as well. Its in that vein. Hoppy, ample roasted malt porters from the West. Always consistent. Never had a bad bottle of this. The variants are pretty good too, especially vanilla melds well with this roasty gem.   Bomber format I could do without.","  rDev Pours black with a thick (3 cm) khaki head. Great retention and good lacing left behind. Starting off well. Aroma is smoking, which is strange, but done well. It smells like you're walking into a smoking BBQ joint. Other notes in the aroma include roasted and toasted malts and cocoa nibs. The flavor profile is dark, with roasted and toasted malts under a billow of smoky notes. A little accent of chocolate and cocoa nibs helps this beer round out well. Mouth feel is velvety, and otherwise smooth. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a well put together beer that really showcases the smoked beer category.  Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev Bottle from ABV  A very dark brown with a dense, light brown head with good retention and gorgeous sheets of lacing, this looks pretty spectacular. The nose is a great blend of smoke, vanilla, roast, coffee, cocoa and a mild hop character. The smoke is a little wet and fruity. The palate opens smoky before a blend of vanilla, cocoa, coffee grounds and a mild fruitiness (cherry wood? apple?) . The roasted malt flavor is heavier on the coffee grounds/chicory flavors. Drying, roasty and with a little cocoa on the finish, this beer is light in body, moderately carbonated and has a nice finish. Quite excellent, i like this more than the variants Stone came up with way back when.","  rDev I read a thread on BA that this one was going to be retired. I then noticed it by chance at Outlet Liquors in Rehoboth, DE sometime in May. Although the enjoy by date was listed as 2/29, I nevertheless bought it with the idea that I might see it again. I finally got around to drinking it tonight. Wish I could try it  fresh , however, I still though it was good. It poured a dark brown and mahogany with a nice fluffy and foamy head. The lace is patchy, ring like, frothy and sticky. A good looking brew. The aroma reminds me mostly of sweet chocolate, roasted malt and light coffee. Some of this sweetness is felt in the tongue but only vaguely, as a moderate but bold bitterness predominates. This bitterness comes from an espresso, burnt malts and assertive hops presence. The smoky quality is mostly felt in the finish and leaves a dry and bitter aftertaste. This one grows on you by the sip. As it warms, it mellows out a bit. The mouthfeel is fluffy, creamy, velvety and smooth. Full in the mouth but not quite robust, just enough to be drinkable.  I hope to find this one again and if possible, find a fresher version to compare.","  Listed in the  1001 , I will try to Have this again soon so I can review it.","  rDev 22oz. bottled 02/24/16  Pours a dark burgundy maroon with a creamy tan khaki head. Smells like dark roasted malts, dark fruit, dark chocolate, caramel, coffee, mild smoke, with grassy pine. Tastes dark and smoky with roasted coffee, dark fruits, dark baker's chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, piney grass, with an earthy woody dry finish. Feels medium-light bodied, creamy with low carbonation. Overall a well crafted smoked porter.","  rDev ** 01/27/2013 Coffee, dark chocolate, some pepper. dark black; medium head.

Pours pitch black with a large light brown head. Smells of coffee, slight fruitiness. Tastes of coffee with slight vanilla and slight piney hops. Beer is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, an above average beer.","  rDev Bomber picked up from the LCBO; bottled Oct 1 2015 and served at cellar temperature.  Pours a deep-hued, translucent chestnut-brown colour with crimson highlights. A full two fingers of light beige-tinged head is situated atop, remaining in place for the long haul. It takes more than 10 minutes to seep away, leaving behind a creamier, more manageable-sized cap and gobs of lovely lacing. Subtly smoky/peaty aroma, with notes of nutty, lightly toasted malts and milk chocolate. Perhaps a few suggestions of molasses, licorice and earthy, herbal hops.  The flavour profile pretty much follows the nose; minimal sweetness, save perhaps a touch of burnt sugar, with the roasted malt elements played up. Peat smoke is a persistent, subtle presence that permeates the whole sip. Chocolate, toasted hazelnut and hints of dark fruit become noticeable by mid-sip, with some earthy, resiny hop astringency rising in intensity as you near the finish. Bittersweet aftertaste with baker's chocolate, lingering roastiness and some woodsmoke flavour. Low carbonation levels, with light-medium body and a soft, smooth, generally satisfying feel in the mouth.   Final Grade: 3.91, a B+. Stone's Smoked Porter is worth a shot, but don't expect miracles. The smoked malt is not overdone, making it potentially good as an introduction to this sort of brew. I'm enjoying it, but not to the extent that I would consider this a memorable beer, or a 'must-try' or anything like that. It's pretty good, and I'd certainly give it a shot if I spotted it on tap somewhere, but it's not something I expect to return to frequently.","  rDev Bottle dated 11/17/15: Pours a lovely mahogany that appears decently clear near the edges. Tan head, fluffy, caps the beer for the whole pour. Lacing is quite nice.  Nose has a light bit of smoke atop a basic porter nose of toasted bread and some roasted malt notes.  Taste leans more porter for me, but a nice porter. The smoke is quite light and acts more like an accent initially. Typically pronounced bitterness, earthy to grassy back up the porter base. With a little warmthand looking for it, I get more smoke, but not much more than I get from some strong stout roasted malts. As the beer starts to get to the edge of being too warm for the porter, the smoke comes out a little more.  Medium body, but with a little friction on the tongue as I sip it.  A solid porter as a base makes it hard to rate this beer low. I wish the smoke took on a bit more of the flavor profile. The smoke was noticeable, but not flavorful, to me, almost like the beer was brewed next to a fire instead of as a part of it.","  rDev Guess I'm not digging the ashtray notes added to a sharply bitter roasty dark beer. Looks like a lot of people either love this or hate it. Not for me.","  rDev A 22 fl oz bomber with a bottled on date of 17th July 2015 and an enjoy by date of 14th November 2015. Poured into a Spiegelau stout glass.  Appearance: Poured a dark dark brown colour with a light amber hue and a nice two fingered tan head that dissipates slowly leaving stringy lacing.  Aroma: Smoky, roasted malts with some light chocolate and cream.  Taste: Roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. There is also some light smoke which is ashy and hints of licorice and milk coffee.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, medium bodied with light to medium carbonation.  Overall: The smoke taste was a bit ashy for me, but otherwise this was a nice smoked porter.","  rDev 650 ml bottle served fairly cold into a St. Pauli Girl clear mug. Purchased while visiting the USA. Enjoy by date is July 24, 2015, so unfortunately I'm a bit late. Let's give it a go anyways.  Appearance - Dark, dark chestnut brown, practically blots out all light. Nice finger and change of tan head that recedes slowly and leaves behind a plethora of gorgeous lacing.  Smell - A lot of burnt malt notes, some firewood and a dank earthiness dominate the aromas.No sweetness to be found anywhere.  Taste - Big and bitter, burnt malt, with earthy flavors throughout. Tastes like burnt wood, but in a good way. The smoke is present, but comes through more with and ashy, wooden flavor. Charcoal is the overall profile that comes to mind. A tiny bit of dark chocolate on the aftertaste. I think the smoke is too prevalent but did enjoy it for what it is.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and surprisingly light bodied, with soft carbonation. Still feels a little heavier because of the profiles, but good feel.  Overall - An enjoyable smoked porter, with big smokey flavors, with the taste of wood and a generally ashy bitterness. Definitely worth a try especially for those that like smoked beers, rauchbiers etc.","  rDev This beer pours a simple black with a satisfyingly thick head. The aroma presents hickory smoke, tobacco, cedar, coffee, and burning gasoline, though not in an unpleasant way. Indeed, I love the slightly mechanical hint to this beer. I also get a touch of roasted hazelnut on the nose, this one grows as the beer warms. The taste leads with a sweet coffee flavor, followed by hickory smoke, the kind you get from eating really good smoked barbecue. The motuhfeel isa bit thin, but maybe that is for the best given the heavy quality of the beer. Overall I adore this beer. It is deep, rich, complex, and utterly drinkable.","  rDev Had on tap at Zeno's in State College, PA. Poured into a snifter.  L: Pours an inky black with thin tannish head.  S: Smokey, with roasted malts and chocolate.  T/F: Smooth as silk. This is roasted malt heavy at the front with flashes of cocoa and coffee. The smokiness hits you towards the finish and isn't unpleasant. This is a big flavor kind of beer, and like most of the good stuff it becomes more complex and rich as it warms.   O: A very cool beer from Stone. It deserves at least two samplings to get the full effect. It's not one I go for regularly, but I always enjoy it when I pick one up.","  rDev Date: June 272015... Glassware: Victory no nick.... Occasion: a cold June night lingers on---with Game of Thrones to ponder and rue... Appearance: dark black, intimidating body that allows an equally ominous brown head that webs archways across the glass in artful fashion; a thick half-inch ring holds staunchly; walls of head blanket the glass as it drains.... Aroma: a soft, milky whisp of lactic activity; some chocolate, licorice and some citric hops, the usual Stone calling card.... Palate: smooth, sensibly sippable; medium-bodied, creamy and softly carbonated; a drinkable porter... .Taste: milky, chocolaty, but rather subdued in its profile, almost apologetic in its assertiveness; a malty finish ensures a pleasant, roasted profile...Overall: A smooth, mildly flavorful example of the style--not nearly as prolific as the bottle’s script proclaims...a welcome but unworthy follow-up to the Founders Breakfast Stout...","  rDev The aroma is hops, malts and hint of smoke. The flavor is smoke up front with an edge of hops that is balanced by the malts, chocolate being the dominate element of the malts along with a mild nuttiness. A complex porter, hoppier than most but makes it stands out.","  rDev Stone Brewing 'Smoked Porter' @ 5.9% , served from a 650 ml bottle purchased for $6.90 A-pour is a dark cola brown from the bottle to a near black in the glass with some ruby red at the bottom of the glass peeking thru a fine medium size off-white head leaving a streaky lace along the pint  S-some smoke T-ok taste , some smokey bitterness on the swallow MF-ok/decent carbonation , medium body Ov-ok/good beer , just an ok porter prost LampertLand","  rDev Pours very dark brown which almost seems black color with a foamy 1-2 finger dark tan head that was full of bubbles and faded on the slower side, leaving very good lacing and rings as it went down.   Smells of smoked malt, charcoal and burning campfire wood up front, with burnt coffee, woody notes, cocoa powder, light peat moss, light vanilla or caramel, and just of whiff of floral hops. It is very smoky but somehow a sweetness manages to sneak through like the hops released some citrus fruit and the smoked malt let out some s’mores notes. All in all a very nice smoky nose.   As smoky as the aroma was, the flavor is more burnt malt and coffee, with nice chocolate, toffee, cocoa and smoky sweetness that has a sharp bitterness that seems as much piney or citrus hops as it does smoked malts. Along with the smoked malts/grains comes some herbal notes, grassy hops, light fruit, coffee beans (maybe even vanilla beans), syrup and faint licorice. It is not too smoky like drinking a campfire, it's nice and complex considering that it’s so malt dominant. In a role reversal the hops give the malt a nice backbone, and this is as tasty as I remember it from a few years back.   Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with a light and almost watery flow that has a medium/lightly chewy body, light carbonation and an ashy bitter aftertaste that is smoky and full of coffee and cocoa powder notes. The finish is close to clean, but leave the smoky flavor lingering like a good cigar. Overall a really solid porter that is well priced and always tasty.","  rDev Not very good.

In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.  The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.  The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.  The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.  Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find.","  rDev 2016 - Cerberus. Black wax.  Poured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass. Thick head of tiny dark tan bubbles that dissipated to a thin cap. No lacing left in the glass.  Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.  Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!  Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.  Overall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly.","  rDev Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.  Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.  Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.  It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.  This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating.","  rDev Pours darkness of course, dark tan head good lacing.  Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.  Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.  Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with an awesome hop/char bitter/sweet balance; and no minimal acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 12% after the finish. Overall this is an amazing Russian imperial stout. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV with the modestly bitter/charred/resinous/drying finish. Nicely soft, and not overly bitter/charred. Definitely needs a bit of age for the freshness. Perfectly balanced between super rich dark/black/roasted malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast.

Reminds me of Old Raspy a lot on the fresh hop intensity.","  rDev I tried a bottle of this at the brewery whilst in town for a work conference with my co-workers. The beer poured an opaque dark and had thin tan head that did not leave much lacing. The scent had dark fruit and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast malt base and dark fruit and raisin highlights. The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.","  rDev 2010 Vintage (Vampire artwork)... poured from a black waxed bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Dark, dark mahogany pour.. nearly black with thin off-white head. Nice ring of lacing.  S: Rich and roasty... cocoa, dark fruit, aromatic wood, and burned sugars.  T.F: Smooth and creamy. Sweet and rich up front... strong chocolate and roasted sugars. Plum and baked raisin with a little vanilla mixed in. Complex and subtle... better as it warms, and the ABV is well hidden. A bit warming... more complex roast goodness at the finish.  O: An outstanding RIS, and even after 9 years in the cellar this is mellow but still fantastic. The only RIS I've had that I think is clearly better is 3 Floyd's 'Dark Lord'.","  rDev Pours black with a finger of dense, khaki foam. Head retention as a whole is moderate, with the final ring lasting a long while after the pour. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts with heavy raisins, molasses, brown sugar, and toffee. It smells sweet, and nears on a sickly cloying level of sweetness straight out of the fridge. As it warms, the heavy raisins and dark fruits subside a touch, and with the gritty roasty malt bitterness, reaches a more favorable balance. Flavor profile is raisins, plums, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and smoke. Malts hit notes of roasty, toasty, nutty and caramely adding depth and darkness. Initially at fridge temperature, the balance is skewed towards a cloying level of sweetness, but as the beer warms, melds into a more favorable balance. A bit of residual malt bitterness helps taper the sweetness off the tongue at the end. Mouth feel is medium-thick, and turns to thick as the beer warms. It has a silty, very fine granular texture that adds to the weight of the experience. Overall, a stout with depth that remains dynamic every degree or so of temperature change. At the colder temperatures, it’s not much to talk about it, but as it nears the suggested serving temperatures, it really opens up and reveals its personality.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle. 2016 vintage reviewed in May of 2019.","  rDev Bottled 8-30-2017.","  rDev Thick, chewy, roasty beer with lots of vanilla, cherry, raisin and dark chocolate.

It has amazing head retention and lacing. It is picture perfect.  Aroma: The beer smells like alcohol, a strong wood scent, chocolate, coffee, and burnt sugar.  Taste: Up front there is a bitter woody flavor with a hint of pine and carbon. This is met with some coffee and alcohol in the middle.   Mouthfeel: The body is thick and full but it feels soft on the palate. It almost feels foamy or fuzzy across the tongue.  Overall: The beer has a lot to offer. It is a very rewarding beer to drink because it keeps pushing character in both aroma and flavor onto the palate or into the nose. I would recommend it and I would drink it again on occasion.","  rDev A - Pours motor oil black with a two finger tan head. Decent amount of soapy lacing.  S - Aroma is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts and cherries.  T - The taste is dark chocolate, coffee, cherries, raisins, plums, molasses, black licorice and light char.  M - Full body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft crisp finsih.  O - Super tasty stout. Great balance of flavors and super drinkable at 12% ABV.","  rDev I was happy to receive this beer through a BIF last year. Today was a great day I am going crack it open. The waxed cap gave way to a hiss and then the Russian Imperial Stout found its way to my nostrils, the smell was intoxicating. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour on the beer produced a two finger head with exceptional retention. The head medium tan dissipated slowly leaving heavy thick lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 dark brown nearly black. The beer is opaque. The beer has a beautiful appearance.   The initial aroma is dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. Next, I smell dark cherries, figs, anise, burnt sugar, toffee, herbal, bready, earthy, and malty sweetness.   The flavors in the beer are raisins, dark chocolate, coffee, tart cherries, herbal, spicy floral, resin, anise, char, a touch of smokiness, bready, earthy, malty sweetness, toffee, and a hint of soy sauce.   The body of the beer is thick and dry.   The mouthfeel of the beer is full, medium-low carbonation, and a full finish.   This beer is incredible. You crave more of this goodness as the character in the beer begins to unfold. The beer has a beautiful balance and harmony like many great beers. I am glad I have the opportunity to drink this beer. As the beer warms up more, the flavor becomes more pronounced.","  rDev 2016 version. I found this at a liquor store just north of Minneapolis and I am drinking it now because it's -35 degrees outside and getting colder. Thanks Fargo, ND for amazing drinking weather. Smallish dark brownish tan head sit above a super dark coal black beer. Burnt malts, licorice, and I think maybe a bit of prune coming through in the nose. Dark rich malt with light licorice taste laced with very light hints of prunes, raisins, and undetermined attributes. I loved the aftertaste that was really dry without being really dry, caught me off guard in a weird way. The thing I liked most about this beer was that it had a great stout taste without shoving coffee, chocolate, or barrel aging down your throat. Don't get me wrong, I love those too, but this was a great beer that doesn't need to rely on those tricks.","  rDev On tap at Mikkeller &amp; Friends in Copenhagen.  Pours jet black with a little halo of chocolate colored foam.  Smell is roasty with notes of coffee, cocoa, molasses and a hint of cinnamon and licorice.  Taste is powerful and roasty. Big hits of coffee and dark chocolate kick things off and are complemented by notes of dried fruit, molasses and cinnamon. Long finish, nd the chocolate becomes even more prevalent with warmth.  Mouthfeel is medium to ful, creamy and well carbonated.  Overall, just a terrific stout, powerful but balanced."]},{"Name":"The Mad Elf","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/694/7531/","Brewery":"Tröegs Brewing Company","Style":"Strong Ale - Belgian Dark","Alcohol":11.00,"Score":87.0,"Comments":["  rDev Picked up a single from The Blue Door Bottleshop 11-26-21 for $3.50.

It's a dark copper colored liquid that's more translucent than opaque. Almost no head was produced by the pour and no glass lacing is expected. A sweet fruity malt aroma dominants what the nose picks up. The taste is sweet and fruity, overwhelmed by a Belgian yeast flavour. The heavy dose of alcohol is more noticeable to the gullet than to the tongue and that’s a good job of disguising it. There's more carbonation on the tongue than the eyes would indicate awaited. It is what it is, a heavy hitting, sweetened and strong Belgian Ale. This should get better ratings by those that embrace the style.","  rDev 12 oz can.

This review is of the 2020....it poured a clear rich amber with no head and no lace. The scent had Belgian spice with dark fruit notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink even with the big abv. There was Belgian spice mixed with cinnamon, cherry and and nice sweetness for balance. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.","  rDev it's definitely a belgian-inspired ale.... nice sipper and good flavor for the 11%.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) can into a custom taster pint; freshest by 10/25/2020. Guessing it's exported, that means it was canned 10/25/2019. A: Pours a crystal clear, dark copper color with a ruddiness and ochre to ruby highlights, a less than one finger, short-lived head, and no lacing to speak of. S: Aromas of cherry, caramel, and honey. T: Sweet. Flavors mirror the nose very closely. Subtle, but cumin like bitterness that  balances  the insanity. M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Booziness is evident and not a plus. O: I really like this. A sweet melange of caramelized barley, cherry, and honey, offset by solid, but not overpowering bitterness. Just what the Doctor ordered for the seasonal blues. How is it not Braggot?","  rDev 12oz can freshest by 10/29/2019 poured into a Chimay goblet at fridge temp 11% ABV. The beer pours bright reddish amber with very light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of fine bubbles. Very little lacing is left behind. The aroma is Belgian yeast, honey and cherries. The taste is semisweet cherry wrapped malt with honey showing up mid to late palate. The spicy notes from the yeast build to a climax at the barely bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. The spicy yeast and gentle tartness from the cherry keep the sweetness pleasant and not cloying. Overall, very good. This is a very nice and unique take on the BSDA.","  rDev From the can, it pours a solid clear amber with a modest head. In the nose, malt and a bit of alcohol (not a surprise there!). In the mouth, a sweetish malty flavor coats the tongue.

Not a bad thing, don't like be banged over the head with these things. Tastes like the smell, but not as good. Alcohol is far too present. Very sweet. Very cloying. Boozy. Some more carbonation would help, as well as being a bit drier.  Could be a great beer, but it kinda sucks.

Pours a dark reddish brown with fine, soapy head.  Smell is sweet and a bit spicy with notes of cherries, honey and cinnamon.  Taste is sweet, but with some bitterness to it. Note of cherries, honey, cinnamon and nutmeg. No booze and nice balance.  Mouthfeel is medium to full, well carbonated.  Overall, a really nice dessert beer. Hides it's ABV almost too well.","  rDev Looks clear ruby red as the label indicates, with a small bubbly off white head. Decent retention. Some lacing left. Smells like overripe bananas dried sweet cherry, Maraschino cherry syrup, fig, raisin, pumpernickel bread, hay, clove, and black pepper. Tastes quite sweet upfront--honey and cherry candy hitting immediately, followed by date, plum, fig, and raisin. Lots of brown sugar, toffee, and molasses. Toasted brown bread malt in the middle. A faint overripe banana bread presence throughout, mostly banana bread. Finishes dangerously dry and spicy, lots of clove, ginger, coriander, and a bit of black pepper. Feels warm going down. Highly carbonated, but deceptively medium-bodied and seemingly crisp. Dry on the finish, but a bit slick and oily from sugars. Dangerously drinkable for its abv.

A good beer.","  rDev This strange thing pours a ruby port color with no head and notes of dark cherries, wood, brown sugar and vanilla.   Big, bold, sweet, boozy flavor with a thick, luxuriant texture and little carbonation. Flavors include molasses, honey, figs, and black pepper. Yeast lingers in aftertaste. A little sweet for regular imbibing, but not a bad end of the night brew.","  rDev A friend gave me a bottle of this, freshest by date is 9/18/18 so it's still got a couple of months before reaching that date. Aroma is mostly malty, very faint cherry smell in the distant background, Poured a red tinged dark amber color with no head. Taste is sugary, boozy, malty with just a hint of the cherry showing through but not in an enticing manner. Slightly sour note, the flavors of this beer don't seem to blend in a harmonious fashion to me. It's certainly not an offensive beer but it isn't something I would seek out, especially at the $16+ price the locals were asking for it. I found it somewhat of a chore to drink a bottle. I usually really like Troegs beers, but this one just isn't one that I can recommend, I can understand why my friend gave this away.","  rDev 12oz bottle courtesy of bl00. I believe it's my 1st from Troegs. According to the label, it's  Best Before 100218.   Ruby-brown in color, with a thin, beige head. Said head dropped faster than Trump's approval ratings among the non-MAGA crowd. Not surprising given the high abv.  Sweet and boozy aroma. Smells like cherries and honey. Belgian yeast aromas were not so distinct beyond a whiff of spiciness.   Sweetness in the flavor as well. Honey and cherries, as advertised. A little more cinnamony Belgian spiciness emerges in the flavor, but it's still way in the back compared to a typical beer of the style.  Carbonation seems low. Mouthfeel kinda flat and heavy.  Not a bad beer, but the carbonation issues hurt things. As for the sweetness overpowering the Belgian yeast notes, I'd be interested in trying one that was closer to that best by date, maybe things would be melding a little better by then. If I come across it again, I'll sit tight on it a while longer. Regardless, my thanks to Dan for something I'd not get a shot at locally.","  rDev Reddish brown color,low carbonation but still has a decent feel. Aroma isn't strong but it's cherry candy,yeast and spice. Taste is identical,cherrys and spice followed by a little honey. Alcohol is really well hidden except for a small medicinal taste which is impressive but also something to be careful of as I had to stop at one","  rDev All Belgian Strong Ale all day. Belgian yeast esters, banana, cloves and caramel. Not getting much Cherry flavor. Belgian candi sugar sweetness. Somewhat dry finish. Medium thick mouth feel. Smooth. Pretty good.","  rDev Dusty copper with a thin khaki blanket that dies off completely.  Smell is banana bread, tons of Belgian yeast, with raisin and caramel.  Taste is big yet oddly sweet Belgian yeast, spiced apple pie, plum and metallic cranberries. The spiciness of the Belgian yeast makes this relatively moderately spiced Christmas beer seem ultra spiced, so it amps up what doesn't need amping up.  Full and frothy.","  rDev Tröegs The Mad Elf brewed by Tröegs Brewing Company, with an ABV of 11.00% This brew pours out a deep brown amber color with a nice off white head.

Overall a real nice and interesting Belgian strong dark ale.","  rDev Out of the bottle it pours a translucent brown color that looks darker when it hits the glass and also has elements of ruby red. Minimal head quickly disappears and leaves no lacing or remnants; I'd like to see more from a Belgian. A lot going on in the aroma; my favorite feature of the beer. Dark fruits such as raisins, prunes and figs with a splash of alcohol. There is also a nice coating of dark chocolate malt as well as spices such as cinnamon and cloves. The dark fruit detected in the aroma are evident in the taste, along with a dried red grape consistency that is evident in a sweeter red wine. The predominance of sweetness in the taste can border on cloying at times, except for the fact that there is a cherry tartness that balances things out somewhat. There is some spicy clove like elements that are found in the middle phase, however, the sweetness returns towards the end. The alcohol is evident, although well masked for such a high ABV drink. It is on the high side of medium bodied. I feel that this one had some nice qualities, however, I would have liked to see more spicy Belgian characteristics to balance out the sweetness. Maybe I should give it another chance as a dessert beer?","  rDev 12oz bottle in a snifter.  Cherry red color with a thin head and lots of bubbles. Plenty of lacing.  Strong alcohol over cherries and honey. Boozy.   Memories of the cherry flavored medicines of my childhood is the best I can do here.  I feel that I'll eschew this  beer  forever more.  This does not meet my definition of  BEER .","  rDev 12 oz bottle served just above fridge temperature into a pint glass.   Appearance - a dark mahogany or Amber color with a little haze. A thin half finger of tan head is poured and has good staying power. Not much lacing and carbonation is pretty average.  Smell - honey, cherries and Belgian yeast especially. There's a little bit of Christmas baking and fruitcake in there, but generally sweet, cherry leaning and sweetened with honey.  Taste - like the nose, but initially even with more sweetness before a bitter hop note at the end reels everything in. A little too sweet but a nice treat around Christmas. Some spices too giving this the cross between a winter warmer and a dark strong Belgian. Doesn't hit cough syrup for me, but I can see how some get there.  Mouthfeel - smooth and a little syrupy, heavy bodied and carbonation is modest. Works with this flavor combo but could be cloying to some.  Overall - Mad Elf is a fine winter special with plenty of flavor, more than enough booze to keep you prone and a nice honey aspect to it. However due to the sweetness, I can't see this being a regular sipper, although certain worth a try,","  rDev -I have had a couple of these seasonally for many years. This bottle pour is clear red-amber with a a thin wisp of tan foam. The aroma is candi sugar. The prominent flavors are Belgian candi-sugar and pleasant cherry. In all, the brew lacks a depth of flavors, and the finish is more slick than dry, but it is a welcome holiday treat nonetheless.","  rDev Darker than amber with more brown. Cherry wood color, and very clear. Head is so miniscule I didn't catch the color. No lacing associated with Belgians.   Very fruity, very sweet on nose. Syrupy, grenadine, mulling spices, moonshine soaked cherries and chocolate. Just too sweet.  Ends up a bit cloying, and syrupy. Lies a bit flat.   The taste is like a banana split, extra cherries, hot fudge. It was flambeed in a copuious amount of O.K. cognac, but not all of it burned up. A bit of herbal punch. Maybe some mint.

The beer was 44 degrees, and I poured it into a pint glass. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head, a light tan head with good retention. The somewhat slow dissipation left a bit of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, mahogany color with ruby hues. When put to a light source, the beer has clarity.   The aromas in the beer are nutty, caramel, toffee, medium roasted malts, a touch of herbal, hint of floral, and malty sweetness.   I taste nuttiness, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, bready, earthiness, a hint of floral, cereal grains, a touch of mineral, and malty sweetness.   The mouthfeel is creamy.

The mouth is creamy and refreshing.","  rDev Pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is roasted malts and dark fruits. Taste is spicy, crisp and dry. Good mouth feel.","  rDev Excellent head production, retention, and lacing, with a creamy dark tan topper of foam slowly receding, leaving behind wide fields of lacing. Body is crystal clear, dark brown with a coppery tint, and very lively.  Fruity, estery nose: dark fruits (raisin, prune) layered atop pumpernickel and wheat bread, accented with pepper notes and a bit of cola. Light toast.  Smooth, light mouthfeel. Lively yet slick. Very drinkable. Thickens slightly as it warms.  Flavor follows the nose somewhat. Dark fruit and a light banana note mingle with dark bread and cola, yielding to a nutty and lightly toasty middle. Cola returns on the back end, along with prune and a leafy green herbal note, lending a moderate bitterness to clear the way for the next sip.  Definitely a beer you can quickly quaff - but not  crushable,  exactly. Rather, the semi-dry, clean, bitter finish leaves little lingering aftertaste, and simply readies you for the next sip before you're done fully savoring the previous.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a clear slightly reddish brown with a nice off white/light tan head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing. In the nose, it is malty and sweet. in the mouth, it is nicely flavored, malty and slightly sweet. Nice brown ale, considering that the style is not my favorite, I still think this is nice.","  rDev Pours a dark reddish brown colour with a small head that dissipates quickly.

But does it deliver enough to make me revisit my present-day perceptions of the style?  Short answer, no.   Pours a light caramel brown. Looks good in the glass. The aroma has a light malty nuttiness to it, although faint and imperceptible. The caramel malt comes across on the palate. Thin, sweet, but thankfully not cloying. I paired this with a vegan chili stew and found it played well.","  rDev L- Deep chestnut brown, clear, pours with 3mm pale tan head. [ps 15mins later and the head is holding 100%]. S- Mild just a light toasty note. T- Mildly toasty, light hops, decent malty richness which seems to grow a notch as it warms a touch, becoming pleasantly robust. I think the thing here is the great balance. Nothing seems out of proportion, no facet is out of proportion making this eminently sessionable. F- For 5.0% it's quite a robust Taste+Feel. It was 32C today in London and I'm enjoying this chilled from the fridge. In winter I can see this working well due to it's robust character, just I'd chill it less then so the character has even more room to express itself. O- I don't see/drink many brown ales.

Sweet &amp; malty aroma of nutty grain, caramel, toffee, and fruit. Flavors are malty and sweet too, with notes of toffee, caramel, toasted nutty grain, mild fruitiness, and earthy hops. Medium body, ample carbonation, balanced finish. It has been about 10 years since I had this one. It was fun to come back to.","  rDev Pours a ruby tinted brown with about a finger and a half of light tan head, moderate lacing  Aromas of toasted malt, dark fruit, mild yeast, a tad muted without any nuttiness  The taste is a bit more bold, the dark fruits come out with a chocolate sweetness and the roast of the nuts come forward slightly, almost like an almond  Feels a bit still at first, but the carbonation builds. Drinks really easy for a brown, finishes light and bitter  I was expecting a little more flavor from this, but it could be a freshness issue; I couldn't find a bottled date anywhere. Nevertheless, I would drink this again","  rDev Pours a dark caramel-brown with excellent foamy carbonation and head that lingers well. Nice big bubbles linger in the lacing.   Very aromatic for the style and the ABV, with toasted malts forward. Brown bread and butterscotch. The promised nuttiness is definitely there along with hints of grassy and earthy hops. For such a simple delivery it smells awesome.  The flavor is simple, yet deserves more words than I'll write here. In one word--balanced. The toasted caramel/butterscotch malt sweetness certainly leads the show, but the brew also closes with solid yet restrained old-school earthy hops. In between these balanced bookends is a melange of nutty (almond and hazelnut mostly) and bready (dough, biscuit, and toast) flavors that round out the whole.   The brew is just-so medium on reflection, but excellent carbonation makes it seem lighter than that.  In a new brew world where it oftentimes seems like the only route to big aromas and flavors are ABV, malt, and hop bombs, this classic is simply outstanding. The brew looks pretty sitting in the glass, and smells spectacular. Then, every flavor is just so, but restrained and balanced at the same time. The earthy hops are pure old school Brit and outstanding.","  rDev Bottled but sadly not bottle conditioned but in a nice dark brown glass  Pours a nut brown body with good tobacco stain coloured head Aroma is roasted chestnut and dry roast  Flavour is dark sugars with a dry finish","  rDev 550ml bottle into a tulip.  L: Pours a surprisingly muddy reddish-brown body - lots of haze along with some larger particulate chunks - under a lovely dense tan head. Tremendous retention and lacing, but the lack of clarity and presence of chunks is troubling.  S: Fairly sweet, overripe fruit is the dominant characteristic. Some nuttiness and biscuity malt as well. Prune is the biggest single note. Disappointing.  T: Follows the nose, but worse. Slightly rotten fruit is the main flavor, with the maltiness only briefly appearing before a muddled bitterness closes things out. Really unpleasant, sadly.  F: Fine. Fairly light-bodied with soft carbonation.  O: Huge disappointment. I remember really liking this one, but it's been over a decade since I had it so maybe my tastes have changed. A more likely explanation is that this is a woefully out-of-date bottle, but as it lacks a readily decipherable date code I can't be sure. In any case, I'll likely hold off on revisiting this unless I'm sure I'm getting it fresh and in good condition, since I'd bet it can be better.  Beers of Fame tick 185/250.

British Brown  Pours a large creamy foamy 1 finger tan head that retains well, decent lacing, clear but deep mahogany reddish-brown color  Nose fair malt aroma, toffee, nutty, biscuity, smooth mild sweet but rich moderate caramel, then chocolate notes as it warms, hops bring some aromas with herbal earthy, very English ingredients  Taste brings more malts out front, fair sweetness with lots of caramel, smooth rich caramel, a bit nutty, biscuity, some toffee, a touch of chocolate, hops kick in with fair medium bitterness, a bit earthy with flavor but not much, fair balance but mostly leans to malt, drier finish getting a little spicy-earthy hop bitterness, but smooth  Mouth is medium to a bit lighter bodied, medium carbonation  Overall not bad, holds fairly well to style, I'm not a huge fan of the hop character and I feel it get a little too aggressive compare to the malts, but enjoyable and fits the style nicely","  rDev From notes 5/25/12: Pours a clear dark bronze with thin ruby hints, a single finger of fluffy, soap bubble, beige/light tan, somewhat lasting head that leaves thin, wispy lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, syrupy sweet toffee and a hint of cocoa.Taste is rich roast, toast, dark bread malty, sweet caramel, toffee and roasted nuts finishing with a pleasant bitterness that builds and lingers well into the aftertaste. Except for the bitterness the finish and aftertaste are somewhat cola like.","  rDev This brewery continues to amaze me - it always lives up to its very lofty reputation. This was a nice smooth beer, very enjoyable and sessionable. Nice amber-copper color with some fluffy head and very spotty lingering lacing. Smells faintly of grain, malt and nutty goodness.

Rich and decadent with a chewy mouthfeel. ","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium snifter.  L - Extremely deep brown color, just short of black. Good clarity can be seen around the edges when it is held up to the light, otherwise it is too dark to let light through. Light tan colored head subsides rapidly to a thin sheet of fine bubbles and similar lacing.   S - Very nice aromas for a stout: bitter dark chocolate, espresso, roasted grain. No hops evident. Yeast only distinguishable as a faint, vaguely fruity note.   T - The roasted grains dominate the flavors for me, followed by chocolate, then espresso as the palate develops. Just before the off-dry finish there is a return of the roasted grains, coming across like slightly burnt kernels of barley. Across all the other flavors there overlays a sweet fruitiness that rounds out the burnt notes. I believe it must come from fermentation character, but I am not sure.  F - Medium to thick body with only low carbonation to lighten it. Strong hops bitterness blends well with the bitterness of roasted grains. Some alcohol presence, but not hot.   O - A fine example of an American stout.","  Pours a dark brown to black color with at least a finger of beige head. The nose and flavor profile are nicely roasty. The body is spot on for the style.  This is a plain old solid stout that is not huge but very tasty anyway.  This paired well with my roast pork au jus dinner.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a tulip.  L: Black body with clear ruby-brown highlights around the extreme edges; one inch of dense light-brown head. Good retention, plenty of clingy lace. Lovely.  S: Rich, straightforward roasted malt. Dark chocolate is the dominant note, but there are hints of coffee, walnut, and dank resinous hops. The deeper I inhale the more of the hoppiness comes through - first pine, then cannabis. Quite enjoyable, and distinct.  T: Hops give a jolt of herbaceousness right up front, with the bittersweet chocolate and coffee building in behind. Only a hint of malt sweetness on the midpalate, with major bitterness on the finish and a long, bitter, smoky aftertaste. Intense and enjoyable, but a bit unbalanced.  F: Medium-bodied and well-carbonated. Closer to a Porter than a typical Stout in terms of body, but perfectly fine.  O: Really enjoyable hoppy Stout. The aroma is particularly complex and delightful, and I enjoy the assertive bitterness that is so difficult to find in any style these days. Really well made beer.  Beers of Fame tick 190/250. Cheers!","  rDev 12 oz bottle, slightly past the best-by date. One of the more complex straight-up stouts I have had with flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, vanilla, earthy oak, and a hint of red wine fruitiness. An excellent stout and far superior to the vast majority of adjunct stouts being pumped out these days.","  rDev Had it with my prime rib Christmas dinner.  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.

Enjoyed it with Christmas dinner.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Best by date stamped on label is '03/16/19'. Nearly full black colored body, with the tiniest of dark brown highlighted edge. Two finger tan head stays around and reduces by a half. Leaves behind rings of froth lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malts, with flavors of dark chocolate and coffee. Expresses a touch of vanilla. Taste is more harsh than the smell, with char attached to the dark roasted malts. In addition there is bitter espresso and dark chocolate. No sweetness here. Dry, chalky finish. Medium mouth feel, with a smooth touch. Good carbonation. A standard bearer for non-sweet stouts that express a dark, dry, and slightly bitter taste profile. Quite massive for its lower ABV%.

The taste is roasty malts with more chocolate and coffee ending in a roast driven medium bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. I'm not getting any hop presence, except a bit of earthiness in the finish. Overall, very good. A touch one dimensional with the roasty, bitter notes, but well made and pleasant.

T - Solid but falls a little after 3 months in the bottle, loses some of the strong flavor F - Good carbonation, stays prickly on the mouth, without being dominant O - Still one of the better stouts out there by a major American brewery, and perhaps one of THEIR best beers at Deschutes. Not too many other D beers turn me on anymore, but this one is an exception.","  rDev Pours black with two fingers of caramel-khaki foam that retains well. Aroma is roasted, toasted, nutted, and caramel malts with a smooth induction of dark flavors, without being soul-condemning dark. Flavor profile is, again, a smooth induction of malts that blend deep and dark with smooth and sweet. Notes of roasted, toasted, caramel, nutted, and bread malts all poke through. It has a splendid smoothness and balance. Mouth feel is velvety, with a medium thickness, offering up the texture of much larger stouts, with the consistency of a more approachable beer. Overall, a good balance of daily consumable with large and boisterous. A true classic.   Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev  Best by 1/7/19 ; drank 8/18/18 @ the Yarchives.

Dark chocolate &amp; faint raspberry flavors up front; fresh earth notes on the finish.   A fine, sturdy American stout. I'd have another...","  Got a 12 oz bottle of this to try. poured into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a very dark brown, practically black color that's not at all interested in letting in any light at all. Has a fluffy looking, tan head that's over an inch thick when poured with good retention. Good lacing too. Aromas of very roasted malts with chocolate and caramel notes as well as bit of roasted black coffee goodness. The taste is pretty much the same, only much stronger than the aroma, with roasted malts with a bit of caramel sweetness, dark chocolate bitter sweetness, and black coffee bitterness along with some earthy hops that add some additional bitterness. The sweet cocoa notes really come out more as the beer sits and warms a bit. Has a slightly crisp, mainly smooth, and somewhat frothy and creamy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with light to moderate carbonation. Also has a bit of a lactic like quality, which is a nice touch here that works well for this beer. Has a clean finish with a mix of a sweet, butter, and lactic like after taste. A good warm weather stout on this warm summer night here in Cleveland.  Eric","  rDev Poured into a narrow water glass: color is solid black, brown edges, tan head with fine bubbles, head presents 1/2 thick and dissipates to thin top.  Smell is roasted malt, very pleasant, light coffee and hint cocoa as well.   Taste is great - big roasty malt, moderate sweetness, good espresso and cocoa notes. Simple, yet delicious and really easy to drink.   Mouthfeel is moderate, pleasant carbonation, moderate sweetness.   Overall a great stout with fully roast and light sweetness with good cocoa and coffee/espresso notes.","  rDev 12oz bottle best before 08/01/18. I've been drinking these for years, how have I never reviewed Obsidian Stout before? Is it because I confuse Obsidian Stout with Black Butte Porter? Served in a chalice.  Beer oprus black with a medium brown head which falls before too long. Aroma is wickedly nice, with loads of roasted barley, burnt toast, and hazelnuts. Flavor is bold, with a presence of bitter baking chocolate but a tinge of hops in the finish. Served cold I'm finding the carbonation too aggressive for the style, although it does keep this big American Stout from feeling heavy.","  rDev For 6.4%, this is damn good. No Coca Cola flavors or texture at all. Smooth chocolate notes - just like the hipster barista you passed out next to - makes during her waking hours. A little bit of roast... yeah, it’s ok. I guess I was crazy to think I would find FIS quality in a lower ABV stout. Good, a lil thin, but solid.","  rDev On draft at Billy Jack's in Harrisonburg. Beautiful beer, looked like it was nitro but was not. Very creamy tan head. Medium strong malty aroma with a bit of dark chocolate and roast. Delicious, the taste follows the nose. Creamy but not chewy. A really good stout, enjoyable and not overly strong.","  rDev Twelve ounce bottle copped from Pub 365 in Las Vegas. Pours a jet black ebony hue with minimal frothing.

Almost black and perfectly opaque with a fabulous foamy mottled tan and brown head. The head quickly dissipates. If there is one quibble, it's that the lacing is fairly non-existent.  Aromas of roasted, almost burnt, barley, giving way to strong coffee (but not chocolate) notes and faint solvent alcohol. The aroma is very forward and present--but not overpowering, just not subtle.  The flavor is a fine extension of its nose. Sweet malts are there at the first sip on the tip of the tongue, but they are very quickly balanced by roasted grain, bitter coffee, and faint chocolate. Maybe a touch overbalanced to the bitter and burnt flavors, but not offputting--only a personal taste issue. Just a hint of booze and hops at the finish.  For what is a pretty  stout  take on the style, it has a remarkably light mouthfeel. Medium bodied with good carbonation.   Overall, a pretty solid stout.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Dark black pour with a thick and creamy tan head. Malty chocolate goodness in the nose. Starts a touch sweet, then coffee, bitter chocolate and just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish. Excellent.","  rDev Bottle poured into a snifter   Black brown liquid. Brown frothy, bouncy one finger foam cap, good lacings  Aroma of espresso, chocolate and roasted malts  Espresso taste over roast malts  Mouthfeel is fuzzier than I like in a stout  Good stout","  rDev This beer pours a simple black with a large mocha head. The aroma features chocolate, mild coffee, cream, and oddly, yogurt. The flavor is also dominated by chocolate, with coffee, a moderate sweetness, and some green flavors as well, maybe even mint. The mouthfeel is relatively thin, clean,a and low in carbonation. Overall this is a nice classic stout, nothing showy, and somewhat thin, but very tasty, and easy to drink more than one in a sitting.","  rDev -in duvel glass. best by 09.25.16. consumed 01.25.17. warmed to 45-47c.  A: Deep inky black exit from the bottle was viscose. A dark and frothy leathery colored head sits atop with a moderate rate of retention. Small speckled lace band.   S: Freshly roasted coffee beans and softly charred wood. A deep and rich sense of dry chocolate moves in with light hints of cocoa-alcohol. Really smooth sense of chocolate-coffee roastiness lingers on.   T: Rich roasty flavor, freshly grounded coffee beans and charred wood with some roasted pine. A bittering blast of burnt chocolate, dry campfire minerality and silty ash. Big blast of roasted charred flavor and dry vanilla finish out.  M: Medium-full body, roasted warmth on inner cheeks, quiet carbonation, viscose feel.   O: Bittering and dark roasted nature, nice presentation and aroma followed by a big flavor and hearty mouthful. outstanding try.","  rDev This poured black and thick, about a half inch of rapidly falling head leaving a few bubbles rafting happily on top.   The smell is incredible. Espresso, chocolate, raspberry like tea, and I think a hint of tobacco.   The taste is easy going initially, a little chocolate and coffee and the raspberry note floating over it all. Then it builds in intensity, growing more coffee-like with an underlayment of sweetness, definite presence of dark malts followed by a sharp, intense bitterness that fades quickly. There is a lingering combo of the lighter fruit and tobacco. Wonderful surprise there.   The texture is delightful. It is silky and smooth, leaving a little chalky residue after the taste finishes. Low on the carbonation, not quite as thick as it looked on the pour but medium to heavy body. What a fabulous stout! Highly recommended.","  rDev L: Pours a luscious pitch black color with a creamy tan head and a few fingers of lacing on the glass, a very inviting looking stout.  S: Open with aromas of dark chocolate, and a strong bitter espresso flavor, some dark roasted malt, and char follow in the background. Very little hop presence. A slight bit of fruit in the nose.  T: A strong dark chocolate, with a strong bitter espresso flavor, dark roasted malt, and char follow in the background. A slight bit of fruit, and very little hop presence. The bitterness is slightly strong on this beer but other than that it is a really nice stout.  F: Very smooth and creamy and full body.  O: The bitterness in the taste is a little strong compared to the rest of the beer, but otherwise this is a fantastic stout.","  rDev From the 12 oz bottle in a pint glass. This most excellent stout pours a deep coal black with a fantastic head of light brown foam that subsides to a thick layer with excellent lacing. Nose of subtle cocoa, moderate coffee, roasted malts, and subtle cream laden char. Flavors exceed the nose with  rich coffee and bakers chocolate with subtle char, light cream on the rear mingling with subtle herbal hops for balance, and light notes of dark fruit on the back. Very nice mouth feel; smooth, rich, lightly creamy, and loaded with dark roasted malt notes. Overall a sensational stout from an excellent brewery.

Almost no head, as expected with such a high ABV beer. What was there was tan, but went away rapidly.

A hint of chocolate.  Taste - Boozy flavor, however there's a lot more there. Up front I get some chocolate. There's tons of toffee and caramel on the backside. Tons of barrel flavor throughout.  This is very boozy, and you know it's very high ABV. It has a warming burn, but not too harsh. Just enough to let you know you're drinking a 20%+ beer. Fairly thick. Smooth also.  This is a sipper for sure. Yes, I know some have chugged it, but it's really best to take your time to enjoy this beauty. Probably the biggest knock against it is the size.

Reviewed 2/16/20. 2016 Edition. Etched on the shoulder above the rear label “B#3501 9/8/16” above “09:31 000906”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.9 degrees F. Appearance – 3. First pour – Medium brown, clear. Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, brown around the top edge.  Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles fizzing away, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin complete ring of tiny bubbles, fed by aggressive effervescence.  Lacing – None, not unexpected at 20.3% ABV. Aroma – 4 - Has an almost weak, watery dark fruit aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background, but I must really horn it to pick up the bourbon. Flavor – 4 – This begins somewhat sweet with weak flavors of “dark fruit’’ with raisins being weakly predominant and prunes trailing behind. Dates are weakly present. No alcohol (20.3% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate occurs as it warms while being held in the mouth. No alcohol on the exhale, oddly enough. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops. Palate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4. Like the Chicxulub meteor, this burns all the way down my esophagus before striking my gastric mucosa, leaving a massive crater and wiping out all the helicobacter dinosaurs in my own, personal, mass extinction event. Otherwise, the flavors are subdued and blended to the point of making it difficult to separate individuals from the background salmagundi, providing a coherent and cogent synthesis of deep fruity flavors, sans wood or bourbon. Appearance is totally average: brown black, no head, but somehow looks less viscous than Old Engine Oil (of which I’ll soon be drinking sixers). Overall, a decent delivery system for high levels of alcohol. I capped the bottle while I can still make those decisions.","  rDev 2009 vintage - poured from a 750mL bottle into a small snifter.   Bistre body with very little carbonation producing a tiny khaki collar; fast running tears; poor retention.  Deep, sweet, fruit-heavy, rich aromatics with molasses, prunes, figs, toasted sugar, and faint tobacco. No real signs of oxidation, infection, or souring despite being 11 years old.  Vanilla, caramel, toffee, treacle, dark cherries, coffee, and tobacco in the palate entry. Medium, slightly medicinal (cough syrup) finish. Complex, but possibly a bit past its prime.  Sticky, medium-bodied mouthfeel with substantial but not excessive heat from the ABV.   More than the sum of its parts, this is still one of the biggest stouts available, although, consequently, it's a bit sweet/hot.","  rDev 2018 bottle thanks to the generosity of @2beerdogs, opened in honour of my Opa Jan.  Pour is actually thinner/lighter than I'd expected, though once it gathers in the glass it does gain some more of that menace. But ultimately it's closer to a cola/dark syrup/dark chestnut brown than it is a molasses black. Not much head at all: nothing more than a drifting of bubbles around the edge. No lacing to speak of.   Nose brings less alcohol heat than I'd feared. Sweet bourbon vanilla and oak. Some caramel. Honestly just not as strong as I'd expected overall. More pleasant and mellow and sweet.   Flavour again belies the behemoth that lurks in these waters. 19.2% on the label, but I could be convinced of significantly less than that. Maybe not half, but closer to that than actuality. While I do get some heat, especially as I work my way through the glass, the prominent flavours are more the rest of the barrel, much like the nose. Vanilla, oak, caramel, maybe a hint of sweet sweet chocolate, maybe riesen-like toffee... This is decadent and rich without really being luxuriant.   Smoothe and while it's thin (unsurprising given the alcohol and that), it is not conspicuously so. Again, this is a masterclass in taking an overbearing characteristic and folding it in to subtly be simply a presence. That may sound like damning with faint praise, but I absolutely do not mean it as such. Dangerously easy to drink for the near-liqeuer level abv.  Thank you Derek for supplying me with this delicious inebriant!","  rDev Pours slick black with a thin mocha colored head settles quickly to a thin ring.

T: Again with figgy bourbon flavors and sweet malt, definite soy sauce and booze still a bit rough after aging this one 3.5 years! Cherry tartness. Drenched in syrupy sweetness.  F: It’s a big beer so some heat is expected still and the carbonation is decent, but it is quite thinner than expected.  O: Aged 3.5 years to be drinkable still starts hot when chilled, nice tartness but a bit boozy and sweet! So many better big stouts. Not up to this hype.","  rDev Bottled on 10/05/17.

Plum, toffee, and molasses give it a little extra boost. Aroma mellows as the beer warms, providing a kaleidoscope of dark stout flavors, with the alcohol receding into the background. Flavor profile is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts quickly followed by toffee, molasses, and bourbon. There is a boozy, heavy burn at the back fresh out of the fridge, but as it warms the bourbon turns to more of a warm liquid, as opposed to a molten express delivery of alcohol. The dense flavor profile covers up the near 20% ABV well, but the booze still peeks through, even after aging for a little over a year. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, grainy texture. Overall, a hearty, boozy stout with a huge ABV. It remains well balanced all things considered, but the ABV still peaks through.   Served in a 8oz Black Tuesday glass from a 750mL bottle. 2016 bottle reviewed in 2018.","  rDev 2016 vintage, drank in 04/2018","  rDev 2015 version. Not a great looking stout. Kinda thin/no head etc. Aroma is bourbon and cardboard. Big and boozy. Chocolate, bourbon and buttery greatness. Quite a great stout.","  rDev 750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/18/2013. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small foamy khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, dark bread, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, and date; with light notes of marshmallow, licorice, smoke, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. A bit of increasing booziness in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, dark bread, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, and date; with light notes of marshmallow, licorice, smoke, char, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, dark bread, dark fruit, marshmallow, light smoke/char, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Mildly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a very creamy/silky/velvety/rich, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden; a lightly increasing warmth of 18.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance, without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. A highly enjoyable offering.","  rDev Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with dark tan bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.   Smell - The beer had a rich sweet bourbony molasses nose with strong malt overtones.   Taste - I noticed the bourbon first. Then came chocolate, tobacco, fudge, anise, and burnt malts. The warming sensation was start to finish with the rich booziness.   Mouthfeel - Not only did it look like used motor oil, but it had the viscosity.   Overall - I like Chocolate Rain better, but this is solid.","  rDev Bottle from 2013  A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black beer topped by a finger and a half of dense tan head that fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing S: Smells of bourbon barrels with that classic oak, caramel, and vanilla. There are also some nice roasty notes along with some chocolate and coffee. Slight molasses note at times as well. Alcohol is a given at this ABV T: Taste is nice and roasty with some bitter dark chocolate covered espresso beans. Nice oak, caramel and vanilla as well. Slightly bitter roasted malts as well that comes off with more of a coffee note. As the beer warms that slight molasses note comes out to play as well. Swallow is saccharine sweet with the caramel and vanilla from the barrel finishing strong with some slight roasted malt flavor toward the end. M: This beer is on the lighter side of being full bodied with a slightly silky feel. Carbonation is low and adequate for the style. With the high abv this one has a dry finish. O: Just a big beautiful beer that is super flavorful, super complex, and super high in alcohol. This is the one that started it all and it still kicks ass. Definitely worth giving a try and least once. This one is a lot more common now so it doesn't have the trade value it used to.","  rDev 2016 Edition. 1 Pint, 9.4oz. 20.3% ABV. Poured into a standard tulip.  Look: Pours jet black, surprisingly high head of light tan, bubbly foam. Smell: Very sweet! Notes of dark fruit, hints of chocolate with a slight booziness. Taste: Incredibly smooth! Like this is 20.3, seriously?? A warm but pleasant warmth, with a body comparable to a barleywine. Many of the tastes found here are of burnt toffee, caramel, malt, and hints of toast.  Feel: Again, so incredibly smooth. A lighter body than expected , with a good amount of carbonation and an expected amount of stickiness.  An incredible addition to my beer repertoire, although different than what I expected. Regardless, an amazing beer worthy of the hype.","  rDev One year of aging. Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a nice malt bourbon. Taste is a mild bourbon malt caramel without any hint of alcohol aftertaste. Obviously need two years of aging.","  rDev 750ml bottle, 2016 edition, shared by a random at rogerdandy's latest typically epic bottle share.   This beer pours a solid black, with a few minor cola highlights, and one stocky finger of rocky, chunky, and bubbly brown head, which leaves surprisingly very little lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.  It smells of burnt caramel malt, charred toffee, vulcanized rubber, vanilla-forward Bourbon barrel, bittersweet cafe-au-lait, medium cocoa powder, and a further mildly acrid booziness. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, dark chocolate, rather warm Bourbon barrel essences, creamed coffee, vanilla extract, and more plain leafy, weedy, and perfumed floral hoppiness.  The carbonation is fairly low due to its weak frothiness, the body a solid, no-nonsense heavyweight, and pretty smooth, with an alcohol-laced creaminess. It finishes sweet and hot - both in a very good way.  Overall, Black Tuesday is yet another stellar behemoth from this SoCal brewing concern - the Bourbon is certainly present, yet hardly intrusive, which renders this one stupidly easy to put back. Great stuff - but yeah, definitely made to share, as already mentioned a few times."]},{"Name":"Palate Wrecker","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2743/45175/","Brewery":"Green Flash Brewing Co.","Style":"IPA - Imperial","Alcohol":9.50,"Score":93.0,"Comments":["  rDev Shared 12 fl. oz. bottle, kindly provided by abemorsten.

The flavour is indeed a  palate wrecker  - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. Extremely hoppy flavour, but still, in its own weird way, fairly  well balanced  - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. Grapefruit, resin / pine and spruce. Yes, it is a  typically American double IPA , and I’ve  seen it before - but still: Oh so GOOD! Halleluja!","  rDev From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.  Bright orange color.   Small white head; no lacing.   Smells strongly of high grade marijuana.   Medium mouthfeel, bordering on thick.   Taste is of grapefruit and great ganja. Booze is present but not overpowering.   A delicious beer.","  rDev From notes 3/9/13: Pours clear golden amber producing 2 fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, off-white head that leaves streaks and webs of lace. Aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla, resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. Taste is hop forward resinous pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange pith and zest, backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. There is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. Starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. Aftertaste is resinous, oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, creamy, drying, oily and drawing.","  rDev Pleasantly surprised, as it is not as intense as I thought after reading the description.

Its a dam fine Imperial IPA i was lucky to find 12 here in Canada","  rDev Let’s see how 6 Lbs. of hops per barrel feels like. It poured a copper orange color with a thick thin off-white head with decent retention. Delicious aroma with notes of passionfruit, lots of tangerines and mango, pineapple, resin, caramel, grapefruit and pine. Hoppy flavor that made me sneeze in the first sip (my nose functions as my internal gadget to gauge hops). Mouth delivered predominant notes of mango, resin, pine, garlic, spices, some toasted malts, grapefruit, mild caramel, tea bags and lemon. Dry and bitter aftertaste with a long but not really aggressive finish. It does not feel to have over three digits of IBUs. Medium towards full body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 9.5% is well disguised. Although this brew has a brutal hop addition, I felt this DIPA relatively very well balanced, no room for those caramel bombs with heavy body brews we often see in the style. Complexity also showed up in several layers. I think this could be a challenge to other brewers to do a similar beer with the same hop punch as balance and rich as this one. Well done. Not for pussies, but you don’t need to be a Neanderthal for this.","  rDev A 12 fl oz bottle with a best before date of 8th August 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.  Appearance: A very nice clear copper amber colour with a two finger off white head that had great retention and left lots of nice sticky lacing.  Aroma: Earthy, piney with citrus mandarin, sweet candied orange and hints of caramel malt.  Taste: Strong bitterness, lots of citrus rind, and whenever they can get through the bitterness, there’s some pine, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel with hints of bready malt and caramel.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: It was nice but this definitely was a palate wrecker. A whole lot of bitterness, which I can certainly enjoy every now and then, but not too often.","  rDev Appearance: orange in color with a short head.  Smell: pine and earthy tones rise from the glass.  Taste: big malt profile with pine, earthiness, grapefruit, and a dank bitterness. Alcohol is noticeable.  Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Light crispness to start, dry and smoother at finish.  Overall: a well balanced big beer that can't be avoided by hop heads.","  rDev On tap at N.E. Tap House Grille Deep golden color with a long lasting frothy off white head. Rich tropical earthy resinous dank hops on the nose with bits of bready and light caramel to round it out. Flavor is a hint on the sweet side but the onslaught of hops balances that nicely. Moderate resinous earthy bitterness. Pretty tasty beer.","  rDev Beautiful red gold color with small white cap.  Aroma of strong pine and a sense of weight behind the aroma. Can't say that I actually smell the malt but it makes it's presence known.  Taste is what you'd expect from a 100 IBU brew. Hops everywhere, infield, outfield, pitching and catching. I began to notice malt about mid palate and that flavor builds to the finish then hops reemerge in the aftertaste. It all comes across as a clean, well made brew that's well rounded for the power it possesses. What I do not detect, in scent or flavor, is alcohol.  Full texture with just enough carbonation.  This is a powerful brew. Body, substance and 9.5 ABV move this guy into the heavyweight class. The sort of thing professional linebackers have for afternoon tea.","  rDev Bottle poured into a Green Flash Brewing Co pint glass  A: Pours golden orange amber with a frothy light beige head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some nice lacing.  S: Resinous pine, spicy herbal notes, fruity notes, some citrus, big caramel/toffee sweetness, bready malt, and a little alcohol.  T: Old school DIPA all the way. Big sweet malty backbone fighting with a mountain of hops. Floral notes jump out first, citrus, lemon, orange, a little grapefruit, big time resinous pine, spicy herbal tones, underlying fruity notes, passion fruit, peach, a hint of melon, sturdy bready malty back bone, and a ton of caramel/toffee sweetness, plus some alcohol that elbows its way into the fight.  M: Full body, moderate carbonation, with a little warmth as it goes down.  O: The smell alone brings back memories of sitting in my long time favorite pub, watching pint after pint of this get poured, wishing I was into IPAs so I could try it just for the name. Years later it's nice to get my hands on it. Gotta say, it lives up to that name. Not my favorite DIPA, but a nice piece of nostalgia for me.","  rDev From their Norfolk Brewery: from the growler, it pours a slightly dark amber with a modest head. Lots of piney hops in the nose. The mouth gets a nicely hoppy malty flavor. Yum!","  rDev Topped with a light tan to pink, dense, uniform foam, the body is a shimmering dark amber.  Dank and fruity on the nose, I get super sticky, sweaty, overripe peach in massive amounts, with a little cannabis and pine. Some woody funk arises as it warms.  Taste flips the script, with super bitter pine coming first, then woody grapefruit and peach meekly trying to fight through this tongue thrashing monster.  Palate Wrecker has a really smooth, slick body, almost soft and pillowy with a balanced finish, if not for the immense and biting bitterness.  To anyone unfamiliar or less experienced with downing intense hop cocktails like this, or even less extreme, normal IPAs, this will scar you for life.","  rDev Pours clean golden amber with head and lace for days. Super pine hops with big malt backbone, but the hops win out. So clean n delish, high powered. One of GF's best brews.","  rDev 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/1/2017.

Burst of pine and grapefruit upon opening the bottle. Aromas of pine, orange, grapefruit, and light caramel that carry over to the palate.

The head is lovely as well at 1 finger and tons of dancing lace.  Tons of chinook and columbus on the nose. Practically a freshly picked hop/opened hop pouch. Slight dirty caramelish aromas behind that.   Um, holy crap. This beer doesn't lie and neither will I. This will destroy your tongue in several ways. First, it stimulates the salival glands to secrete at the utter dryness of the alcohol and hop combining. Second, it twists your tongue as the hop practically attacks it like white blood cells on a virus. Some facial expressions will be made. Third, it scrubs your tongue of all dignity like a paint scraper on the wall. Fourth, the heavy alcohol presence creates a hotness in both your mouth and down your tube to your belly. This is a little tastier but no less bitter than chewing on raw hop.   Feel is hot and burning, with a dry feel and a scrubbing sensation.   Overall, a drain pour in the best way possible. It's simply too much for me. It's my fault, not the beer's. It's not a bad beer. But the hops are insane and it's by far the hoppiest, most bitter beer I've ever had.

Similar flavor profile.","  rDev Clear golden orange with one finger of bone color head that lasts about ten minutes. Splashes of lace on the sides of the nonic pint glass.

Overall a true palate wrecker for sure! Kind of like drinking hop oil.","  rDev Comes in orange, looks less orange as you age these. 1/4  white head. Aroma of massive caramel, hot booze, lots of bitter hops.   Taste is indeed a palate wrecker, its around 100ibus and a ton of caramel crystal malt. Plenty of citrus impact on this one. The fresher it is, the more citrus and hoppiness like a dipa, the more it ages, the more the malt and caramel seem to take over, as well as the alcohol seeming stronger.","  rDev Clear, bright red coloring, milky white head on top, stays small, but stays it does.  Aroma: big, flowery hops presence, plenty of pine, gobs of fruit (gobs, I said, gobs!). Not too bitter, not sweet, either. Nicely balanced, I'd say.  Taste: Now it starts to slay. Intense bitterness boards the palate, with swords brandished, pistols blazing, all it's weapons cocked and ready, in for a conquering. Massive bitterness that lays waste to the tastebuds. Prickly pine and a slathering of citrus, lemon, lime, grapefruit. Intense.  Lean body, nothing to back up the hop attack, but I don't expect such from an self-proclaimed bruiser as this. Malt body takes a back seat to bitter hop punishment. High alcohol lays low at first, then roars on in.  I like this. It's right on the money for what it's trying to do. Oddly, I wasn't impressed when I had the first two bottles. Maybe I just wasn't paying close attention. That can happen sometimes.

Carbonation is moderate, about 2.5 carbs. The nose has the green bananas I would expect but also a bit of cat pee. Mouthfeel is soft, clean, medium light bodied.

A nice hazy light amber pour with a generous head which fades to a light lacing. Aroma is warm bread dough yeast and bannana notes.

While not up in the range of a German hefe, it's a solid offering.","  rDev This may be the second best American hefe. (New Glarus' Dancing Man tops it for sheer refreshment.) SN's Kellerweis shows something different: that American brewers can get very close to the best originals if they apply themselves. (Kinda like the way Japanese applied themselves and started producing the best cars in the 1970s.) Kellerweis is the complete package and competes for a place among the bottom half of the top 10 Hefes in my book.  Kellerweis' sub-par Looks are quickly made up for with Smells having all the good stuff of the top 5... probably just milder. Tastes are in this stratosphere as well. Feel is a bit thin to be a contender for the crown, but that seems to be a trade-off in this subtle style.  Despite SN having 21 Hads from me (putting them about #6), I still shy from them for fear of hops. I am very glad to see that they took on this difficult style and conquered it.  Kellerweis is listed in the  1001  and deserves to be there.","  rDev Pours a hazy, murky yellow with a thick foamy white head. Head retention is strong, with fair lacing left behind. Spicy yeast, coriander, cloves and wheat make up a simple, but startlingly German, aroma. Taste is very simplier, with banana, clove, coriander, wheat, and a bit of spicy yeast on the back. Delicious, and despite the long list of notes, is rather simplistic in it's flavor. Feel is smooth, medium-thin consistency, and exceptionally easy to drink - or gulp. Just a bit of carbonation harshness at the end. Overall, a sublime brew that is easy to gulp. It truly pleases. It would be at home enjoyed outside on a blisteringly hot summer day, or around a cool campfire in the woods. Yum.  Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev Impressive appearance, drops the traditional cloudy yellow with a solid 1  white head on it. Aroma a mixture of clove and banana yeast smells.   Taste still hits those banana and clove notes with a substantial amount of wheat in the mouthfeel, texture is almost gritty. Mild sweetness. Smooth. Bitterness in check, hop usage, for Sierra Nevada, is almost nonexistant.   Just a solid beer in a style I'm not usually down with, but this one is easily described as one of the best from any region.","  rDev Pours hazy straw color with nice carbonation and a slight creamy head. Lots of sediment in this one, including what looked like silt in the bottom of the bottle after the pour.   Smelled bready and did catch some notes of banana, but not as much as others. Tastes gives you a lot of yeast malt and wheat flavor, not a very noticeably hopped - feel has some nice carbonation to it, very light and drinkable.  Overall a really good wheat style beer - very balanced but still allows the yeasts to shine."]},{"Name":"Shock Top Belgian White","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/29/39908/","Brewery":"Anheuser-Busch","Style":"Wheat Beer - Witbier","Alcohol":5.20,"Score":69.0,"Comments":["  rDev On-tap at the local dive - review from notes  Clearish yellow with a head that lasts.

Taste starts with both the peel and flesh of orange, paired with wheat bread and a very faint Belgian wit yeast character. However, it's pretty much all orange-spiked wheat beer more than anything else.  Body is frothy but light with a crisp, tingly semi-dry finish.","  rDev Budweiser by any other name is still a Budweiser. Bland! The look of this beer is the only saving grace, it resembles a Belgian witbier, but once you taste it, you’ll notice it’s not. Not impressed...","  rDev On tap at Oakland Intl Airport. Pale straw colour, white head. Typical witbier aroma and flavour of coriander and citrus / orange peel. Very refreshing, would be happy to drink this again. I suspect that it is underrated due to the ownership of the brewery - I was not aware that this was an AB InBev product, so I rated the beer for what it is.","  rDev Hazy golden orange with one finger of white head. Small amount of lace. Smell is citrus orange. Taste is citrus orange with spice coriander and some wheat. Mouthfeel is medium with ample carbonation. The finish is lightly dry and balanced. Overall a taste of something different. Refreshing.","  rDev Pours less hazy than expected. The brew is pale gold, with a moderate amount of effervescence bubbling up that lasts well glass. The pour produces 2+ fingers of shortlived, foamy, white head which leaves no appreciable lacing or surface cap &amp; only a hint of a collar. Aroma is a little thin but very typical of the style: wheat, sweet bread, coriander, Belgian yeast, fruity esters of orange, banana &amp; a hint of apricot. Taste is also typical of the style but like the nose is thin: wheat, pie dough, coriander, orange, banana &amp; a faint stone fruit hint. There is something melon-like as the finish approaches. Finishes disappointingly thin &amp; everything good or bad with the flavor profile disappears in the dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, creamy, pepper prickly, finishing a little bit thin &amp; slick. I don't know if this has oats in it but it is certainly creamy enough in the front for them to have been used.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours hazy yellow, white head. Aroma is wheat, lemon, clove.

Well carbonated, light bodied, crisp and refreshing.","  rDev A: Pours a hazy medium golden yellow in color with moderate to heavy amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint amber + burnt orange colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall sudsy foamy off-white head that reduces to a large patch of thin film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Just shy of moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Moderate aromas of wheat malts, orange citrus, coriander spice, and Belgian yeast.  T: Upfront there is a moderate flavor of wheat malts with a light amount of cereal grain malts and a light amount of grainy sweetness. That is followed by slightly heavier than light flavors of orange citrus and light flavors of coriander spice. No discernible hop presence and only a hint of bitterness in the finish leaving a light lingering yeastiness in the finish.  M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation.

Taste--Metallic and abrupt citrus; other commenters have mentioned a ton of coriander but I might have welcomed that. I didn't detect anything that nuanced. Does finish crisp and dry with some bitterness at the finish that salvages the taste somewhat.  Feel--The second best thing about this beer. A nice crisp finish, though it comes off as a bit watery.'  Overall--Another macro's attempt that falls short of the mark.

Light herbal bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, orange peel, pear, apple, coriander, clove, wheat, cracker, white bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good; a bit thin for the style. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%.

A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","  rDev Here comes the mass corporate imitation of Blue Moon. Hits the cloudy notes as it should.   Lots of spice rack clove, coriander and lemon. Lots of rind in the nose and taste. Some wheat is perceptible, but it seems like they just spice it up to try and cover up the more traditional beer centric (malt, hops) stuff that people might not like. I like the chocolate version but this one is just not worthy of a place in my fridge unless someone is coming over that is really into this.

S: Creamy rich and milky chocolate character with some marshmallow highlights on the opening nose. Eloquent milky coffee roast is freshly grounded and straight to the glass. Dark chocolate is sweet along with some burnt caramel and cocoa. There's a bit of smokey sweet dark fruit about, cherries and plums in particular that mixes with some roasted pine and silty charred remains. When all is said and done everything blends beautifully together in a balanced way.  T: The flavor was equally rich and rewarding, sweet vanilla and milky roast is very flavorful, along with some smoky wood highlights. Burnt molasses and caramel creamer add sweetness along with some dark fruit of plums and black cherries. There is some roasted pine hop leaves, milky lactose that blends well with the subtle smoky character and backbone. Wet silty ash hints are smooth as silk.

Warm roasted warming on the hold.   O: Overall a perfectly balanced brew, smooth and softly roasted sweet cream stout that is dessert in a glass with an exceptional drinkability. Sweet vanilla, rich coffee roastiness defines this drink, like a smooth Italian coffee.

Taste is coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, a subtle lactose-like sweetness, with a balancing touch of bittering in the finish.  Mouth feel is creamy while also being on the thin side of moderate.  Finish is dryer than the initial taste would lead you to expect, with the roastiness lingering on the tongue.  This is a classic English stout at its heart, which has the creaminess and smoothness of a milk stout. Extremely well executed.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip.  Pours oily dark (nearly black) brown and opaque. The head is excellent, ample, and foamy, and gives way to clingy lacing.   The brew is initially mild in aroma, but delivers more in the  smells  department as it warms. Moderate dark and roasted malts are the obvious star, with lactose sweetness waiting in the wings. Just a hint of metallic or mineral aspect.  Like the nose, the flavor is initially subdued, but opens up as the brew warms. Big roasty malt flavors are the star here, with strong, but not overwhelming lactose sweetness rounding things out. Coffee and chocolate flavors are simple but strong here.   The brew has an excellent feel. A bit thinner on the tongue than it looks in the glass; this nonetheless leads to a nice creamy drinkable brew.

I understand this beer is not infused with anything. The taste is similar with an added layer of dry roasted malt, similar to Beamish (check). A few sips in, I started picking up an odd green olive smell and taste, maybe the olfactory has gone awry. It eventually subsided after a few more sips. I'll have to check that out. The feel is medium and soft, with a medium low amount or carbonation. Other than the momentary green olive experience, this was a tasty stout.

Taste is of smooth, toasted malts that invite notes of vanilla beans, coffee, light chocolate, and a bit of oaky char; a varied and harmonious profile.  Mouthfeel trends toward thick before thinning out into the smooth, semi-dry finish; ultimately remains incredibly creamy and effortless on the palate, in spite of some occasional heavy carbonation that throws things slightly off-balance.

Its a full bodied beer with light carbonation &amp; a fairly thick, smooth feel that goes down well with a pleasantly warming feel to round things off; great stuff. ","  rDev Thank you FlintB for these! 2016 vs 2017 side by side, poured into tekus  2016: A- Black with a two finger tan head 4.25  S- Dark fruits, dark chocolate, roasted malts, caramel malts, hints of licorice. 4.25  T- Roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate, some coffee, caramel malts, touch of licorice. 4.5  M- Smooth, medium body. 4  O- A nice stout for aging, nice balanced dark fruits to the base beer, very enjoyable. 4.25   2017: A- Black with a two finger tan head. 4.25  S- Roasted malts, dark chocolate, caramel malts, some dark fruits, hints of licorice. 4.25  T- Roasted malts, chocolate, touch of dark fruit, caramel malts, hint of licorice. 4.5  M- Smooth, medium body. 4  O- A tasty stout, very nice balance. 4.25","  rDev Nice smooth rich stout with some nice deep flavors. Pours a very deep, dark brown with a little tan head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of malt, stone fruit, molasses, coffee and chocolate. Tastes follows the nose, and there are definitely notes of raisin, plum and currant in there. Also some bread and toasted nuttiness. Smooth mild mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Just a hint of creaminess. Can’t taste the high ABV but I wish this stout were just a little more complex and more coffee/chocolate-forward.","  rDev Here here! Judge Raul has entered his chambers! But unlike Charles Laughton in “Witness for the Prosecution,” this one is not large and in charge. Looks all dark and Stout-like; ok, cool. Aroma is a bit light for me, while taste and feel are the same. It’s tasty like Maureen O’Hara when she’s being all kinds of naughty. Still, Plead The 5th ain’t naughty enough for the Raul man.","  rDev Pours a dark black with a minimal tan head that disappears quickly. Aroma is chocolate, vanilla and alcohol. Tastes of vanilla and alcohol up front and finishes with chocolate. Good mouth feel.","  rDev Bottle poured into teku  Motor oil black syrup in color, thin layer of brown foam quickly settles to a ring  Aroma of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, whiff of licorice  Taste of roasted malts, bit of chocolate, bit of coffee  Roasted coffee lingers on the tip of the tongue  Good beer","  rDev From Labirratorium. In Teku glass. Playing Cally's Trials. Balanced, with everything very well integrated, smooth on the sip and with the abv extremely well hidden","  rDev Undated bottle into pint glass. Pours a very dark brown - looks totally black in the glass. Thin, milk-chocolate colored head. Initial impression is blackstrap molasses, dark chocolate, with maybe a taste of black coffee. Mouthfeel is medium - thinner than I like/expect of an Imperial Stout. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Finish is smooth and semi-sweet - again, the molasses is front and center.  Pt5 isn't something you'd imbibe by the dozen, but if you're sitting by the fire on a chilly February evening it sure makes winter seem a lot more bearable!","  rDev 12oz bottle, bottled on 12/05/17, served in a snifter.   Appearance: Pitch black letting no light through at all. Thin dark tan ring of foam, some fine island and strands of lacing that slowly slid down the glass.   Smell: At first, a little coppery, and then a nice hit of roasted malt, maybe just a hint of almond, and some toffee-like sweetness. Cocoa powder chocolate notes as well.   Taste: Chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, a little licorice, a little marzipan, and a lingering bitterness that is part black coffee, part metallic, part bittersweet chocolate  Mouthfeel: Creamy, just right carbonation. A bit sticky on the teeth and a little warming at the finish.   Overall / Drinkability: A really good imperial stout, quite rich flavors and a nice combination of flavors as well with some interesting notes I haven't typically had in a stout, at least not in awhile. Would definitely pair this with a meal, but quite good by itself as a slow sipping beer. I will definitely have to pick this up again.","  rDev 12oz bottled 11/25/16 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 11% ABV. The beer pours dense black with a little tight reddish brown head. The head recedes quickly leaving just a faint ring and a bit of lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate and just a little tobacco. The taste is dark chocolate up front with a very roasty bitterness coming in to finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated with a wet, but not overly sweet finish. Overall, very good, but not in the same class as some of the titans of the style.","  rDev Dark appearance with tan head that dissipates quickly. Nice caramel aroma. Taste is a very smooth caramel without any alcohol aftertaste. Definitely glad I tried it.","  rDev 2013 version ... awesome sick motor oil. Wow!","  rDev Pour is viscous shiny black with a large, light mocha froth receding to a thin film and thick mocha ring.  Smell has a luscious, seductive peanut buttery nutty coffee roastiness with chocolate milk and a hint of black licorice.  Taste is nutty molasses, dark chocolate, salty roasted nuts and smoky tobacco--Pt5 is just absolutely dialed into the darkness.  Feel is moderately thin though, with a light crisp fizz and semi-dry chew.  Side by side with the bourbon barrel aged version, I liked this better due to the complexity and depth of flavors able to be expressed here without the crippling interference the overbearing barrel brings.","  rDev BIF gift from @superspak. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into stout glass. It pours nearly jet black with mahogany hues when held to the light, with one finger of rich, mocha-colored head and lacing. It's an elegant pour. It smells of dark malt, caramel, cocoa, dark coffee, nuts, and faint bourbon. It is delicious! Chocolate and coffee-forward with vanilla, nuts, and lots of dark cherry. It has a hint of smoke and finishes with just a touch of bitterness. It is medium-bodied, creamy, fairly-lightly carbonated, and despite the 11% ABV it is not overtly boozy. In fact, it is quite easy to drink. I'm surprised by the variation in ratings; folks seem either to really like it or are ambivalent. To me, it's an outstanding RIS; it has all the attributes to make it a leader of the style. It deserves its Outstanding rating.","  rDev Poured into a tulip...  Pours a classic fairly-opaque dark-brown to black. Very little head, perhaps half an inch of root beer float tan, and surprisingly little lacing.  The aroma is somewhat unique, albeit subdued. Amid the smoky coffee notes (expected) are some fairly pronounced herbal notes (anise?) with some solvent in the background.   The flavor is much more of an explosion than the aroma, but follows it. Dark fruit and herbs take more of a center stage than coffee and chocolate. The ABV is fairly well hidden, though there are solvent notes at the finish.   The mouthfeel is excellent. Thick and chewy like an RIS should be, but with a fine dry finish, helped along by ample carbonation and a bite of alcohol bite.  Overall, a fine take on the style, if a bit off-beat.","  rDev No BOD. Pours black. Very little head - less than a finger with a 90 degree pour. Consequently, retention and lacing are also very poor.  Light, but otherwise typical, stout nose. A bit of roast, vey faint char and a touch of malt.  Medium body with a slightly slick texture. Quite outstanding carbonation / body balance. The middle is quite effervescent and the finish is a finely bubbled rollicking explosive ride.   The flavor profile is borderline very good. Complexity is a bit missing in this stout. Flavors are presented well and also are well balanced. Roast with a touch of char float above a very well balanced slightly sweet molasses / caramel base. From the middle on, sweetness peaks and is overcome with a bit of alcohol taste and astringency. The finish is a fade of molasses and alcohol. Dark fruits are missing, except for a brief touch of prune about three quarters through as the alcohol becomes uncovered.","  rDev Pours dark and black like the heart of a volunteer firefighter with a menial job in real life. Nice 3/4  tan/brown head on it, good retention. Aroma is big time roasty with dark fruit bitter notes.   Taste more roast, nice and chewy, dense without being excessively challenging. Hides alcohol nicely. Not overly acrid or bitter. Less dark fruit (plum/raisin/prune) notes than your average RIS, something I definitely appreciate. Usual malt descriptors without adjuncts of roasted coffee and chocolate. Not really much else to say about it, its definitely elite Russian Imperial Stout territory.","  rDev Very dark, black even, with a small brown-tan head that recedes into a thin ring quickly. Dark fruit, chocolate aroma with roasted malts as well. Thick mouth feel. Roasted taste, lots of coffee, with solid bittering in the middle and finish.","  rDev Looks like my review for this was lost, so luckily doing it side by side with the BBA verison, this one has some age on it, white label with no logo cap, must be 2011.  Pours a small darker fizzy head that fades quickly, super dark pitch black beer with looooong legs.  Nose lots of dark malts, plenty of roasted malt barley, char, roasted coffee, some fudgey chocolate, dark roasted cocoa and a little fluffy nougat, some baking spices, that nougat and chocolate bring candy bar sweetness, a creamy note, coffee syrup, chocolate syrup.  Taste brings plenty more dark roasted malts, charred barley, a little burnt coffee, coffee beans, coffee syrup, super dark chocolate, into chocolate syrup and some fudgey chocolate cocoa, a little fluffy nougat and baking spices again and maybe faint anise, mild caramel and syrupy flavors in general, with some spicy bitter hops kicking in late. A little booze warmth, little creamy and fluffy, a little fusel alcohol flavor on the back end.  Mouth is med to fuller bod, a little creamy and fluffy, decent carb, some hot tingly booze.  Overall not bad, better than I remember, less anise and I think there was smoke before, or too much burnt char, but a pretty good beer, feels a touch thin for what it is.","  rDev Aroma is chocolate/dark chocolate, dark malts, coffee and a hint of dry earthiness. The flavor is chocolate/dark chocolate, coffee, dark malts, mild dark fruit/fruit and a mix of big acidity and slight spiciness/alcohol in the finish.","  rDev Appearance - Pours black off white head great lacing  Aroma - Dark chocolate, caramel, tobacco, cocoa and roasted malts.  Flavor - Flavors are well balanced, bitter chocolate, vanilla , cocoa and roasted malts.  Feel- Pretty full mouthfeel coats the mouth very smooth and velvet feeling.  Overall - Very solid beer, great flavors and very smooth feel.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours black with low brown head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits.

This biscuit doesn't last long, because the hops then kick in. They're not as strong as an IPA (of course), but they're there, and linger. The hops tend toward pine.

Appearance: Hazy dark golden glass holds a solid cover of white foam that clings to the side leaving thin tide marks.  Aroma: Mild orange peel citric note on a clean malt base. Bitter orange hop driven note is fairly mild. White bread yeast.  Taste: Classic American Pale ale, malt has a light toasted taste, hops are fruity and bitter, high for a Pale ale but below IPA (XPA) levels. Balance goes slightly toward the bitter end, but fairly well balanced. Light tonic water finish encourages the next sip.  Mouthfeel: Gritty, medium carbonation, fairly dry finish.  Overall: A fine pale ale. I've wanted to try this for a long time given the high scores this has gotten over the years. I can see this being a local favorite, but it's a Pale Ale. A hard style to get super excited about, but would be very happy if it was a regular offering down the street. It's just not exponentially better than a lot of other Pale ales I've had. Put it in a lineup and I'd have a hard time picking it out.","  rDev Has a nice feel,about medium body as well as the same for carbonation.

The taste was again lacking that burst of pine, citrus or tropical fruits that I'd expected despite the fact that all three feature, it's just that all three seemed less pronounced than I'd have liked with the biscuit flavours coming through in equal measure with them. It was a drinkable &amp; enjoyable beer but I'd been expecting a lot more from this one only for it to turn out to be a fairly average offering in the end.","  rDev 16 oz can. Pours slightly hazy dark gold with a medium creamy white head that goes to a thin film that laces the glass.  The aroma is sweet doughy biscuit malt with fruity floral hops.

Malts have to be there to back this up. Thin to medium mouth feel. Good carbonation. A little stinging on the tongue. Quite tasty and flavorful for a lower alcohol level. Pleasant in all ways, but not much more.","  rDev Very good beer, probably should be marketed as an IPA not a pale ale.

From a bomber into a snifter REL#121 SLC#6300 Stout with cacao nibs and coffee added and aged in whisky barrels  Originally had this many moons ago from ScottO. Scored it a 3.13, mentioning that it was a solid coffee stout but not a solid BA coffee stout. I've got the base plus a few 2019 variants here, so it's time to a re-review. Let's see if a few bunch of batches has improved this one.   APPEARANCE: Clear dark brown pour yields a two finger, medium looking, slightly foamy light tan head with decent retention. Clear black body with touches of carbonation evident. Foamy head slowly recedes to a thin wisp. Splotchy wisp remains leaving touches of lacing down the glass as it empties.  SMELL: Whisky, oak, and a level of tartness to it. Cacao and vanilla cream come out more as it sits, as does some roasted coffee aromas.  TASTE: Whisky, oak, a touch of tartness, with some roasted coffee and then a dose of alcohol at the swallow. Bolder finish of wood, whisky, roasted coffee, some light tart character, hints of chocolate, as well as some decent alcohol linger on the palate.  PALATE: Medium body with medium carbonation. A little foamy on the palate, goes down okay with a bit of a burn and finishes somewhat mouth-coating. A decent amount of heat lingers.  OVERALL: Nope. No improvement. Perhaps this beer has gotten worse? In any case, this is mediocre at best. Not off-putting, but certainly not on-putting either. It might be slightly oxidized already, but if it isn’t, then it’s simply not that great. There’s a level of tartness to it that surely wasn’t planned, and the slightly foamy feel isn’t up to snuff either. I’ll finish the bottle, but am rather disappointed with this one. Here’s hoping that the other variants of 2019 turned out better.","  rDev Canned 3/27/20  This is one I’ve heard about for a long time, and I assumed it was a super rare find, so I was shocked to see my local liquor store have a few cases for cheap  Pours completely black with just a thin cap of mocha colored head that reduces to a ring quickly. For the small head, there is a decent amount of lacing  Wow, quite the huge barrel presence in the nose here. Rich oak and vanilla with some bourbon heat. Deep dark and chocolate as well with a hint of coffee and raisin  Yeah that’s bourbon in the taste no doubt, quite a bit of warmth from the alcohol to start the sip. Despite this initial alcohol sweetness, the chocolate and coffee come in with a light roast that perfectly balances the sweet vanilla and caramel, with a touch of smoke to boot  Full bodied and rich with very mild carbonation, this is extremely smooth and balanced. Dessert-like without being sweet, and feels about right for the abv  This is a damn good imperial stout without a ridiculous amount of adjuncts, simple ingredients with a complex flavor profile. I hope to try the variants some day","  rDev 12 oz can  Pours opaque black, tan lacing for a head.  Aroma of coffee, cocoa, toast, licorice, and oak.

Very nice, flavorful smokey stout. Drinks slow and smooth. Rich without being sweet. I like this a lot. I could see myself drinking it semi-regularly. It's not overly sweet like a lot of big stouts so it's a good change of pace.","  rDev Well that's a beauty. It's much more gourmet than the quadrupel barrels version with almond and all that other stuff. It's less dry. It let a nice place for the barrels and shows a unique malt and yeast profile.  Very nice","  rDev Pours black with a quarter inch beige head that dissipated quickly and left islands of lacing. Smells of whiskey, coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of whiskey, coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, toffee and a hint of cherry. Light bodied for a stout with a slightly watery mouth feel, low carbonation, dry finish.","  rDev The Christmas/Holiday Break has begun for me as a substitute teacher &amp; I am anxious to review this one since I am inCANdulous that they put this in CANs! The CANQuest (tm) was roundly scoffed at during its inception many years ago. The idea of an AIS in a CAN was one of the postulations that received great scorn. 8=( Well, I suppose that he who laughs last laughs best! 8=)   From the CAN:  Ultra Premium*Whiskey Barrel-Aged*World-Renowned*Critically Acclaimed*Copious Coffee ;  It's BIG, it's bad, it's one of the best barrel-aged stouts in the World! We take our rich and roasty Imperial Stout and age it in flavorful Whiskey Barrels before adding copious amounts of artisanal coffee and real cacao nibs. The result is a badass beer that will blow your mind.   I was feeling pretty badass as I Crack!ed open the vent &amp; beCAN a steady, gentle C-Line Glug into the awaiting goblet. It did a pseudo-cascade on the way to the formation of just over a finger of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with decent retention. Color was obsidian Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like someone poured a shot of whiskey into my morning cuppa joe! 8=O Man, it was rich and redolent with both whiskey &amp; coffee &amp; I was shaking my head in utter disbelief that they had CANned something like this! Mouthfeel was as though a dollop had been scooped into my mouth &amp; onto my tongue. My CAN was marked as being a solid 10.0% ABV, but it was well-hidden. Dangerously well-hidden, actually. The coffee was prevalent with an underpinning of whiskey as well as dark chocolate and an undeniable smokiness. It was making my eyes water with its intensity. The coffee was what was really tripping me up since it was as strong and as bitter as what I brew up as my daily eye-opener. We used to brew &amp; drink some intense coffee in the Navy, but once I retired, I weaned myself off of it for a while. Between college &amp; becoming a teacher with early-rising hours, I fell back into the trap &amp; now, while I (usually) limit myself to one cup per day, it is equal to this bad boy. Phew. Finish was dry, but the origin of its dryness eluded me. There was just a whole lot going on in this one &amp; I was a bit overwhelmed by it all. YMMV.","  rDev I wouldn’t exactly say that I am confused. No, I have a handle on things. But I’m slightly disappointed. And yes, “slightly” is the word. We have a good beer right here, but it’s not world class like Simone Biles doing flips and shit. Pours beautiful, aroma matches that ten fold, but flavor and feel are a bit of a letdown. Like Edward Arnold’s belly, it’s just not robust at all. And then you swallow the end of a sip, and it’s a little slick and oily (not in a good way). Flavor ends a little too sweet, and I’ve had far many more beers with better feel. It’s ok, but damn (especially at $6.99 a can) what a waste of a beer.","  rDev Can, 2019 vintage, from ABV.   Jet black with a thin, brown head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks decent. The nose, though...so good! Coffee, whiskey, malted milk chocolate, dark caramel and a little char and and vanilla to go with a little honey. A noticeable and potent roasted grain character tempers the sweetness and barrel. Bitter and roasty. The palate opens with a blend of grainy bitterness, coffee and barrel. A definite cereal note is present, along with roasted grain, dark chocolate and mildly bitter hops. Mildly buttery and oily cacao nibs are present, with a soft, deep chocolate character. The whiskey character is mild, lending a pleasant heat and vanilla to the palate. Bitter and mildly boozy on the finish , this beer is medium full in body and softly carbonated. Quite excellent.","  rDev (12 oz can, no date; purchased single off shelf... poured into a snifter)  L: deep dark brown liquid, opaque; dark tan head forms on pour, immediate recede into misty cap, then thin broken collar... very little lace  S: bitter dark chocolate, bourbon barrel char, dark chocolate cake-y malt... bit of spicy booze (or spicy hot pepper?) but the edge on it is nil  T: acidic bitter char, deep-toasted caramelized grain up front; extra roasty, lightly peppery aftertaste... second sip: woody overtone, dense thread of mocha syrup, which gets more rich and caramelly with each sip... bit of an almost red wine vinous booze... the coffee is buried in the background, possibly obscured within the roasted grain character  F: medium-bodied, but on the lighter end, undercut by the ethanol and delicate carbonation; subtle, brief oily viscous drag in the finish, but the soft burn of booze frays any syrupy roll  O: craving this (imp. stout) all day, but ended up being on the phone with gas co. for an hour after pouring it, and it just sat... boldly-flavored, fairly potent, but fairly homogeneous within the barrel-aged stout category (1595)","  rDev This is a  big barrel aged  stout with lots of flavor.

This just has an absolutely lovely balance of roasted/caramel malt, coffee, chocolate and bourbon going on, with the coffee and chocolate being quite rich and smooth. While it is perhaps just a teeny tiny tad too sweet for my personal taste, there still is a great balance between the sweeter and roasted/bitter notes as well, this turning quite a bit more roasted/bitter in the finish.

Taste of whiskey soaked dark roasted malts, with dark roast, bitter coffee, and the sweet chocolate. Chocolate soaked aftertaste.  Thick mouth feel. Mouth coating texture. Good carbonation. This is a decadent treat of a stout beer. Has the components that could be too bitter or too sweet, but this is not the case here. The barrel is there but not overwhelming. Higher ABV% is another component that balances well with the rest; the alcohol expresses but does not burn. Lends itself to a long drinking session because the beer continuously yields a positive experience.","  rDev The best of the Epic's I've tried.

This is a brilliantly balanced beer. The malts aren't overly roasted, the coffee isn't at all bitter, and the barrel aging isn't overdone. The cocoa, which seems more of a feel than a flavor, likely takes the edge off all these other flavors. Great beer.   Mouth is full and smooth, finish is rounds of coffee and whiskey warmth.

Damn yummy.","  rDev Solid black color with really low carbonation . Definitely above average body, slightly oily feel that coats the mouth .also mildly creamy and thick,overall a really great body.

Big Bad Baptist  22 fl. oz. brown glass bottle,  RELEASE#111 11.4%ALC./VOL.   Notes via stream of consciousness: So I've heard of this beer but I didn't release it was brewed with cocoa nibs and coffee, and aged in whiskey barrels. That would explain some of the cost. It's poured an opaque black body beneath a full head of fluffy dark tan foam that's settled into a much denser, inch-thick cap. The head retention is excellent, and I'm assuming that the lacing will be just as good but we'll see. In the aroma I find dark and oily coffee beans first and foremost. I've had stronger coffee aromas in other beers before but this is still pretty good, and then there's some sweetish milk chocolate and a bit of coconut. Very nice. On to the flavor, it's loaded with coffee, but it's not a really roasty coffee which is nice. If the coffee is too dark it can sometimes lend acidity that can be a little harsh. This actually tastes like a cup of black coffee. The chocolate is there as well, and in this case it really tastes like actual milk chocolate. Sometimes you find bittersweet dark chocolate, or floral and fruity Belgian chocolate, or even just baker's chocolate, but this is like chocolate candy - an actual cocoa nib! Once again, very nice. What else is in there? Some golden caramel, and just a hint of toffee. There's an underlying apple-like fruitiness. I'm - oh... - I was just going to say I'm not finding the whiskey barrels but I just got a quick passing note of what seemed like Bourbon. And there is a slight oakiness in the finish that helps to dry it. Let me have another sip and see if I'm finding anything more, or maintaining what I've found... well wonders never cease, I'm finding more of that whiskey, and I'm really liking how the chocolate and coffee combine. I wasn't expecting this to live up to its hype, and I still haven't looked at it's score so let me see... 4.36? Now I'm surprised it's that low! Let me not get all fouled up though, back to the beer. It tastes a lot like a chocolate covered espresso bean to me right now. It's chocolatey, roasty, and nutty. And I think it's perfectly balanced. I didn't even notice the bitterness, and yet it finishes dry. It's sweetish upfront with the chocolate but then it fades at the swallow. The chocolate remains, and some subtle fruitiness, a slight edge of roastiness and coffee, and then just nuttiness. It's not too much of a lingering flavor though. It's not too rich overall. Perfectly balanced. What's the strength on this? I'm pretty sure the label says 11.4%. Wow, I'd never have guessed that, it really doesn't seem like it at all. Usually with a strong beer you get that sense of strength even if that alcohol doesn't show, but not here. Interesting. Looking back, I still have a solid surface covering on my beer. It's a thin cap but it's solid rim to rim; and the lacing is excellent as expected. It's tattered, and there are holes in it, but it's basically a solid sheet of lace all the way down the glass from start to finish. So, what else? Mouthfeel. OK, let's see... definitely dextrinous and viscous, full bodied but more on the full to medium side. It's not overdone. Velvety smooth. Oh did I mention bitterness? I don't think I did, I may have eluded to it in mentioning dryness and balance of sweetness, but I don't think I really covered it. Well there's some acidity to it from the dark malt, not too much, and there's the roastiness as well, but those aren't enough to keep it in check, so we've got hop bitterness but that's certainly not overdone. It seems like just 35 IBUs but I'm sure there's more, at least 55, but against the sweetish malt you can't tell. And so, I am once more convinced that there usually is something behind hype. This is an excellent chocolate and coffee Imperial Stout, and I wonder if all of it's variations are just as good or if I just happened to get a great batch. Absolutely worth seeking out!   - ahhhhh, I should also report that my wife thinks it tastes like I took an ashtray and dumped chocolate milk into it. Maybe that's a little more accurate.   Review# 6,339","  rDev Delicious. I’ve heard a lot about this beer and it didn’t disappoint. Nice dark jet-black color with some mild tan head and a little spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice bourbon, wood, brown sugar, coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, nice wood, malt, brown sugar, molasses, plum and a little raisin. Beer really mellowed and smoothed out as it warmed. Very little alcohol flavor and the high ABV was extremely well-hidden. Smooth, mild, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Great carbonation. Absolutely delicious beer and I’m very happy I found a bomber at a local store.

Uncorked about 2 months later.  A very dark pour for an Oud Bruin. Across the table, it's almost stouty looking. It's got a respectable, tight brown head astop a very dark and nearly opaque body.   Aroma is very bright, as is par for the style, but it lacks any of the overly acidic or vingery nodes that are also common in Oud Bruins. Here, that absence is quite welcome, as it leaves room for plums, red wine, and a nice rounded woodiness.  Tastes like it smells, only smoother and with a bone dry finish. Tart cherry brett up front, moving into a plumy and vinous middle with just a hint of vinegar, ending wonderfully rounded and dry as the barrel aging and bacterial sourness move into near-perfect interplay with one another.

Slight caramel and brown sugar sweetness but nowhere near cloying. More fruit in the flavor except there's a good amount of apple mixed in. Cranberry juice-like tartness with a slight vinegar kick, but it strikes a really nice balance with the malt and fruit flavors.  Medium bodied. Carbonation is low. This just comes across as such an expertly crafted and blended beer. All of the flavors and the body are in check. Really impressive and I'd say it's an excellent intro to sour beers, for those looking to try some.","  rDev (22 oz bottle, poured into a wine glass)  L: crystal-clear dark tawny liquid... rather tall gummy pad of tan foam, doesn't hold long... chunky-jagged specs in the bottom of the bottle... messy splotches of suds left, not an unbroken cap, little lace  S: big bop of mid-dark caramel, sour cherry pits, vinous flourishes... hints of juicy grapefruit flesh, light-brown cocoa-brownie - chocolate-orange??... booze is mellow and brightens it all up... overall, very clean, near-full, on point  T: bright up front, tart bitter lemon in finish, with a hint of nutty yeast in the immediate aftertaste... certainly a somewhat dense, brown bread-crusty malt underneath, but heavily weighed down by the soft acidity of the sour atop, its character never quite rising up and with hardly any sweetness - at least not in like some Belgian examples of the style  F: again, light flowing, but with some body for sure - smooth and lightly glassy (till the dregs go in)... the front and finish both have a bite that mellows with each sip  O: I hesitate to say it could use a lil more sweetness - it does, due to its dry bottom (blush), seem to maybe lack a lil depth (or unique character) - but its dryness will only enhance its pairing appeal... I've had this a few times on tap and this bottle version was, by a few hairs, the most subtle, but the most drinkable","  rDev A more subdued, woody, earthy version of Le Terroir. Murky brown with a skin of creamy head that clings to the glass. Aroma more of darker dried fruits and milder tartness . Excellent companion to Le Terroir . Ying and yang. ’14 and ’16 rated.","  rDev 2016 edition, poured from a bomber into a tulip  L: Pours a clear dark mahogany color... tints of red around the edges and with 1.5 fingers of off-whit head. Sticky lacing.  S: Funky... sour fruit, green apples and cherry. Faint citrus.  T/F: Moderate sour up front... unripe fruits... green apple and lemon rind. A bit of baking cherry and just a dash of brown sugar. Medium carbonation... more than expected, and very sticky on the tongue. Literally coats your mouth after a few sips.  O: A decent mild sour... better than I was expecting, and one of the best I've had from New Belgium. Good intro to the style, and drinking the whole bomber over an hour or two was no problem.","  rDev Poured into a snifter. Clear ruby dark brown color. Thin light tan head that retreated quickly into a resilient cap. Complex aromas of cherry, oak, vanilla, candied apple, and orange. Puckeringly tart up front. Sweet tart candy, cherry, mustiness, and brown sugar, evolving into a subtle funkiness with white wine on the finish."]},{"Name":"Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2372/21950/","Brewery":"Terrapin Beer Company","Style":"Stout - Oatmeal","Alcohol":9.40,"Score":95.0,"Comments":["  rDev Picked up a sixer from TW-Greenville, SC on 11-16-22 for $11.49. No canning date; consumed can #4 1-23-22.  Beer pour dark brown with a beautiful nitro like mocha head that has some nice hang time.  Nose has hints of coffee and mildly roasted malts.  Taste is a mildly roasted malt base with the coffee adjunct blended it subtlety. Finishes with a touch of cream and is well balanced with no sign of coffee astringency.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.  Overall a really nice job of incorporating the coffee adjunct. Can see my self picking this up a few times a year!","  rDev Relatively short lived head with almost no lacing. This smells better than it delivers. Appreciating coffee is the first listed description, but the oatmeal factor is almost missing. The lingering taste becomes bitter and the feel is way short of velvety expected with a stout, maybe because of the high ABV.","  rDev A mighty fine stout from the Turtle folk from the 12 oz can and poured in a snifter. This solid brew pours a deep  dark obsidian with faint cola highlights and a very nice head of tan foam that settles to a thick ring, thin swirling pool, and sports some mighty nice sudsy lacing. Nose of rich coffee, dark  chocolate, char, and caramel sweet malts with a touch of  smoke. Flavors nail it---dark char heavy malts with a rich dark coffee/espresso flavor amongst shaved pieces of  dark semi-sweet chocolate and touched with faint smoke.  Very nice mouth feel; full body, medium light carbonation,  and a rich full finish that is subtly dry.   Overall, a FANTASTIC brew.  Cheers","  rDev 12oz undated can (presumably 2018 version like all the six packs in the store, so 4 months old) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 9.4% ABV. The beer pours truly black with abundant light brown head. The head slowly settles to a nice cap and leaves a complete spotty lacing. The aroma is muted coffee and dark roasted malt. The taste is semisweet chocolate and coffee with a medium to heavy roast driven bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with less than medium carbonation and a semi dry finish. No sign of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Overall, excellent. After checking the Terrapin website, this is a November release. Enjoyable and very well crafted. but I'm sure it's better fresher (if you want the coffee to pop.)","  rDev A - Pours pitch black with a two finger fluffy tan head. Tons of soapy lacing.

Creamy mouthfeel nice soft finish.  O - This is a tasty imperial coffee stout. Definetly recommended.","  rDev Very nice head production and fantastic retention and lacing. Brew is very dark and quite attractive.  Aroma is absolutely stuffed to the gills with coffee. In fact, you really need to dig deep to find the tones of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and roast.  Flavor more or less follows; waves and waves of coffee flavor, not unlike drinking a carbonated glass of cold coffee. Earthy and bitter, with dark chocolate, pine, light char, and a touch of dark fruit.  Creamy and smooth on the palate. Almost chewy.","  rDev 12 ounce can into tulip glass, 2018 vintage. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky tan head with awesome retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, cream, toasted oats, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, wood, herbal, pepper, pine, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and light-moderate earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, cream, toasted oats, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, wood, herbal, pepper, pine, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light pine, woody, herbal, spicy hop; and roast, charred, coffee bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, cream, toasted oats, dark/brown bread, molasses, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, wood, herbal, pepper, pine, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and light-moderate earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with an awesome roast/hop bitter/sweet balance; and no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 9.4%. Overall this is a fantastic imperial coffee oatmeal stout. All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and light-moderate earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the ABV with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Not overly bitter/charred. Amazingly rich malts and balanced fruity/nutty coffee complexity; with nice earthy hop presence/balance against sweetness. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on English base style example as expected.","  rDev On tap at The Cove in York, PA. Pours a very very dark brown with a nice tan head.Initial impression is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and dark malts. Mouthfeel is thin for the style; carbonation is light. Alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden. Finish is dark chocolate with a lingering bitterness. Not bad but not my favorite for the style.","  rDev Very nice beer enjoyed on tap. Dark, almost black color with very minimal head. Some nice lacing that lingered throughout. Smells faintly of rich coffee, hints at what’s to come. Nice tastes of deep dark roast coffee, chocolate, malt and faint hints of bitterness. Very mild carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel and clean finish. Alcohol taste is deceivingly hidden. A very tasty, rich, decadent beer.","  rDev Very slick dark black color with a tall brown head of 3 fingers.   Aroma of Hershey's syrup, raw cookie dough, coffee grounds, light pepper, faint blood.   Flavor has a nice balance of coffee and chocolate (more on the raw cocoa nib side) but leans more towards coffee. Slight metallic presence throughout but not too bad. Some slight black pepper and fudge collide together in the background. Hot alcohol suspends the black pepper back up to the back of the throat after the swallow. A conflicted beer between delicacy and harsh acidity. It's neither a coffee lovers' beer or a chocolate lovers' beer. It's basically the worst of each, but if you like both, it's probably more than tolerable. I personally think it's a marginal-to-okay beer.  Feel is creamy and rich with malt thickness, but also has a thinning out due to hot alcohol which you can also feel. Some roast dryness appears on the finish with more alcohol heat (like icy hot in the throat).   Overall, not a bad beer, just not a great one. Highly regarded, and I can see why as some folks could really get on board with this. For me personally I'd rather have something completely chocolate or completely coffee, not bipolar between the two and not showcasing either one in its own respective spot on the palate.","  rDev Solid black color Body is definitely above average,a creamy thick feel Aroma is mixed grains, espresso beans,a little bakers chocolate as well as a small amount of dark fruit. There's a bitter bite that lingers a while but not unpleasant. Overall a really solid beer that I would get again, a very solid stout","  rDev Poured from can into NB Chalice, 2 finger soapy dark tan head, good retention and lacing. Jet black in the glass, poured thick and viscous looking. Smells of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Taste initially of chocolate and coffee, coffee shines throughout the middle of this beer, the finish is incredibly smooth, very low bitterness, but tames out any sweetness the malt brings to the party. Mouthfeel is lucious on this beer. I picked a six pack of this up back in June of 2017, and I think it was brewed some time in 2016. Had one on vacation and said I would rate it when I got home and totally forgot. Found the remaining 6 pack tucked away on a shelf and figured no coffee coming out of those beers. Well wrong there. Still real coffee forward and more mellow drinking experience than the first one that I had about a year ago. Going to put the rest of these in the fridge and grab another 6 pack next time I am in Florida","  rDev 12 oz bottle at the moment but I've had this many times including both tap and can versions.  This is a bold and robust coffee stout, with a load of dark roasted, quality coffee along with substantial dark roasted grains. Medium bitterness. Full body. Light carbonation.","  rDev Found this in a can at Wegmans (mixed 6 at $11) a) Terrible name. Strong brewer. Pours jet black mounting a finger of dark tan head that slowly fades but laces little. Strong on darkness.  s) Liquor like, with a fine wood, alcohol, brandy, licorice and coffee nose.  t) Continues and expands on that dessert drink taste and feel, up there with any sipper like grande marnier, etc. It's super smooth with a dominant espresso coffee core layered with hints of dark chocolate and alcohol heat.  f) Heavy, thick, very light carbonation, nicely finished, and smooth. Never too sweet or cloying, o) Sum is greater than its parts.","  rDev On tap at Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell. Pours a jet black ebony hue with moderate frothing. Assertive aroma replete with hints of chocolate and mocha. Similar overall flavor profile.","  rDev 2017 vintage. 12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black with a creamy khaki head that slowly falls leaving great retention and nice lacing. The aromas are coffee forward along with some caramel, chocolate and vanilla cream. Malts are there. The flavors follow the nose. Roasted coffee along with some more chocolate and caramel. Chocolate syrup in the finish. It's not bitter and isn't sweet. It's perfectly balanced. Nice malt backbone. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed. Mouthfeel is on the softer side of full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and dangerously drinkable.  This is a great coffee stout. The coffee comes through in the aroma and flavor departments. It's very enjoyable and fun to drink. I really like it. Well done.","  rDev Pours a very dark brown. So brown it looks black. The pour produces less than 2 fingers of mocha, foamy, somewhat lasting head that leaves only a little lace. Aroma is roasted &amp; dark malts, coffee &amp; cold coffee grounds, dark bittersweet chocolate, toffee, a hint of dark fruits &amp; a faint hint of anise/licorice. Taste is earthy coffee, toasted bread, dark bitter chocolate, toffee, prune &amp; fig. Hop presence is best defined as an earthy bitterness just after mid-sip through the aftertaste. The roast &amp; bitter character intensifies in the light chocolate cola aftertaste. Nice coffee notes in both the nose and mouth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth &amp; more silky than creamy.","  rDev Black in color and impenetrable to light. There's a quarter inch thick dense and creamy dark brown cap of foam present. The aroma is deeply bitter and foreboding black coffee and toasted oats. I'm tasting a very bitter dark roasted coffee that is rounded out by the sweet oats. The oats also give this beer a creamy and silky texture especially considering the 9.4% ABV.","  rDev Pours a dark shiny black color. Thick tan head dissipates over time leaving just a ring of tan foam along the outside of the beer. No lacing.   Smell has notes of coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, coffee grinds, and oats.   Taste follows the nose with lots of coffee and coffee grind flavors coming through. Coffee is on the acidic side. Lots of roasted malts and an oatmeal cookie like flavor. Undertones of cocoa and a mild chocolate sweetness come through as well. Picking up a bit of a bitter flavor on the back end, but that seems to be from the acidic coffee and not hops.   Feel is incredibly smooth and creamy. Medium bodied - thinner for an imperial stout, but I wouldn't call it watery. Mild to medium carbonation.   Overall this is a well done coffee stout. However, there are so many well done coffee stouts now-a-days that this one frankly just doesn't stand out like it used too. Still its an outstanding beer and well worth drinking.","  rDev ** 01/31/2015 look: Dark black color. Creamy white head.  Aroma is strong coffee, sugar, molasses.  Taste is strong coffee, some chocolate. Vinegar like after taste.  Medium carb. Some thick syrupy feel.   Pretty good, but no FBS. Peripherals are excellent, but taste brings it down to earth.  ** 03/13/2017 Can to Snifter.  I agree with the previous assessment. It's a well crafted brew. The sourish vinegar-like and acidic aftertaste knocks it down from what could be top end excellence.  ** 03/31/2017  Side by side with Rise-n-Shine. The barrel aged beer is decidedly superior.  **","  rDev Looks good in the glass, almost black with a two finger head. Smell is roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste is as expected with the smell. A little thin on mouthfeel but still a very good stout.","  rDev Terrapin has certainly produced something special with this brew...  Poured from a can, it was a mesmerizing look of dark tannish color, high lighted with caramel hue. The smell was short of amazing - you can smell the coffee, the oatmeal, and a touch of booziness. The feel starts off very carbonated, but then as it warms it eases up. It has a medium to full-bodied feel that eases the overall effect of the carbonation, which is a good thing in my book. Taste was very good, though I mostly tasted the coffee and couldn't quite pull out the oatmeal notes or the booziness of the drink. Overall, it is a very good beer - I think I've had better Terrapins, but this one is certainly special.","  rDev In winnowing through the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody, I came across a bottle of the 2014 vintage, which I am going to review now. I understand that 2016 has been CANned &amp; you may rest assured that I will be looking for one for inclusion in The CANQuest (tm). As to the naming of it, I have submitted an Update to have it changed to read  W-n-B Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout  since that is what the CAN on their website reads. I know that it stands for  Wake 'n' Bake , but you need to go with the label.   From the bottle:  Two Athens, GA companies, Terrapin and Jittery Joe's, have teamed up to create a unique blend of coffee used to produce this robust and flavorful beer. So when it comes to a morning beverage ... 'Wake Up with Beer' ;  Brewed with: Jittery Joe's Coffee ;  Monster Beer Tour ;  10th Anniversary W-n-B .  Just before I Pop!ped the cap, I thought about some of the previous reviews and their use of snifters or other glassware than what I had lined up. I then had a change of heart &amp; decided to go with a snifter, instead. This change also meant that I would be conducting a gentle pour as my snifters are more fragile than most of my glassware &amp; I do not need anything untoward occurring. A vigorous in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, deep-brown head that quickly reverted to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled strongly of rich, freshly-roasted dark coffee, much like I make every morning as a retired U.S. Navy sailor. It also had a breadiness, giving it a fresh-baked brownie odor to go along with the coffee. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. The taste was really rich &amp; made me think of Chocolate-Coffee-Peanut Butter Swirl ice cream! Whew. It was quite the riot of flavors, but they meshed well throughout. Warming, I also began to get a light charcoal smokiness, but it remained semi-sweet. Finish was semi-sweet, in the sense that a Hershey's Dark Chocolate bar is semi-sweet. Bittersweet is another applicable term in this instance. This was a pleasant enough beer, but one was satiating.  My CANQuest (tm) has paid off! Today is Sun, 21 June 2020 &amp; I have procured a CAN of this beer for review &amp; inclusion in The CANQuest!   From the CAN:  Brewed to the Highest Expectations ;  W-n-B Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout ;  Stout with Coffee Added ;  Two Athens, GA companies, Terrapin and Jittery Joe's, have teamed up to create a unique blend of coffee used to produce this robust and flavorful beer. So when it comes to a morning beverage ... 'Why Not Beer' ;  Brewed with: Jittery Joe's Coffee .  I beCAN by Crack!ing open the vent for a slow, gentle C-Line Glug into the awaiting glass. I watched in rapt fascination as the pseudo-cascade foamed beautifully to form just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with very good retention. Color was Matter of Fact Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO police and/or light penetration. Nose had the deep-roasted coffee aspect of my morning cuppa joe! Mmm. I am retired Navy &amp; I used to run on java underway, as I was on a frequent basis. I like my coffee like my women - thick, strong &amp; black! It needs to be coaxed through the drip filter or it is just tea. If it ain't smokin', it just ain't no damn good. This smelled like my kinda roast! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but on the approach. The taste was less coffee than liquefied dark fudge brownie! It had a bittersweet Baker's chocolate aspect that slowly blossomed into a coffee-like bitterness. Phew. Yeah, this will work. Finish was dry &amp; smoky, roasty, chocolaty with an undeniable coffee presence. 8=O YMMV.","  rDev DATE: July 24, 2016... OCCASION: a HOT summer day turns to a night of AC that will pair well with this stout... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter... this  monster beer  pours a pitch-black body, a ring of brown, thin, bubbly head, and a nebula swirl in its middle... with the weighty alcohol content, this is a good-looking beer... robust espresso brine--like damp or dank decaff--blams the nostrils, with oatmeal and rum-like ethanol... a lively, instantaneously warming impact accompanies the smooth, creamy body that is beyond sippable for the power it packs... halfway through, the beer continues to deliver a stunning combination of peat, smoke and salty oatmeal with an intense chocolate and coffee bean punch... having trouble finding holes in this profile.. perhaps the only regret is this isn't a bomber.... from its name to its label, from its impact to its flavor, quite impressive... I would seek this out again in a heartbeat, and what a boon from a breakpack mix...","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a dark brown/black color with a small tan head. Lots of coffee in the nose.

Top notch stout, lots of great flavor and aroma, and the coffee doesn't disappoint. If you're looking for a coffee stout that is up front with the coffee, you'd be hard pressed to find something better than this. Definitely worth trying and coming back to.","  Very good looking dark brown with over an inch of lighter brown head, small bubbles, excellent retention. Aroma delivered as promised, chocolate, coffee, smooth oatmeal and barley.  Taste was more of that same smoothness. Very similar to Breakfast Stout. Everything is big except for the alcohol on the tongue. If you want the coffee, drink these fresh, they go largely absent after six months.

The head is two fingers of fine white foam that leaves ample lace and replenishes itself with a swirl. Attractive.   S: Very complex, with some vintage qualities (sherry especially) alongside the core components I remember from drinking this regularly on draft a decade or more ago: banana, apple, coconut, vanilla, and white pepper. Any actual bourbon aroma has long since faded, but the sweet accompaniments remain. Very nice.   T: Opens with some bready malt ahead of the complex layers of fruitiness - banana and apple are joined by a strong melon note - followed by a touch of spice ahead of a rather boozy, dry finish. Lots of ethanol on the swallow, sadly overshadowing the great flavors that started things off. Not unexpected or particularly blameworthy in an 11% pale beer, but out of balance with the rest of the profile.   F: Medium-bodied and full of soft, velvety effervescence. Perfect for the style.   O: I love everything about this beer except its booziness, which I recall being the one thing I disliked about it back in the day. Even seven years conditioning in the bottle hasn’t fully tamed it, but it’s certainly held up admirably. I knew it wasn’t fresh when I opened it, but was shocked at just how old it was.

Flavors include the same fruity esters, a slight vinous quality has me imagining grape tannins.   Mouthfeel leans full with active, but just short of prickly, carbonation and a clean finish.  Overall I have been keeping this one in constant rotation as it is perfect for just sipping and for matching with food: anything from arugula and kale salads to chicken and pork.","  rDev Pours a light straw color with well over a finger of head. There isn't any discernible barrel or yeasty notes in the nose. In fact, the only essence that I got was a faint soapiness. The flavor profile definitely has bourbon upfront. The bourbon also seems to give this offering a modest residual sweetness. The maltiness that accompanied the bourbon was rather pedestrian.","  rDev #1796 - Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)... I've just been reminded what I paid for this... well, hope it's good!! L- Pale golden, poured with a very slight haze and 15mm fine-bubble white head. S- Lightly perfumed, quite subtle, reminds me of a Belgian Blond. T- ... it slowly creeps up on you (no sledge-hammer, which is nice at this ABV%). It's full-on, it's like a Belgian Blond but it's dryer (hoppy-dry) and it seems somewhat acidic. F- Pungent, deep and yet it balances it with some serious hops too. O- Ah now (dohhhh!) I get the liquor barrel note, as it warms a touch. The timber note, and the pretty hard ABV% edge which together add a sense of dryness and intensity. Certainly a statement beer, but I'm left thinking such might come better from a 'black beer' than a golden one... Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! --&gt; Aged in whisky barrels. But dare I say this? I'm not sure if that makes it better.

I love their regular Golden Ale and this barrel aging really gives it some nice complementary tropical fruit flavors.....I get a lot of coconut along with white grapes... Subtle touch of vanilla and wood as well. The coconut really shines through and blends perfectly with the base beer.  Perfect tight carbonation...medium bodied...drinks so easy....has a light booziness but nothing sharp or overwhelming. Excellent beer.","  rDev This was my Christmas dinner beer! Found it in a grocery store in Richmond, VA.  Poured a hazy bright golden yellow color with a creamy white head and great curtain lacing. Sweet home and herbal smell and taste. The beer has a pleasant flavor from the barrel aging and has a complex, sophisticated taste as it warms. Overall, an excellent beer that is a nice treat.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with tall, long-lasting, foamy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of yeast, spices, biscuit malt, grassy hops and ripe fruit. Body is full, creamy and tangy.

Banana, clove, vanilla in the nose. More banana, coconut, distinct Jim Beam, vanilla, oak, peppery. Alcohol is well-hidden flavor-wise, but you can feel it massaging your brain into submission. Fruity with some red delicious apple. Light char and marshmallow. Sweet and toasty with caramel and bready notes. Light-bodied, tight carbonation, and uber-creamy. Spicy and semi-dry finish.  Too many barrel-aged beers are over-the-top. Not the case with Curieux. Allagash was able to retain everything I love about a Tripel and complement it with layers of depth and nuances from the barrel. This is a delicious, world-class beer.","  rDev Pours a semi-cloudy burnished gold color. Thick, tight velvety head dissipates partially but not completely. A nice thin layer of foam is retained on top of the beer.   Aroma has notes of light oak and fruity ester notes. A touch of sweetness coming through on the nose.   Taste follows the nose with notes of oak, fruity esters, and light bourbon-y notes. Has a yeasty character to it - reminiscent of a yeast dinner roll. As it warms you get more of that Jim Beam bourbon coming through.  Feel is surprisingly moderate for such a high abv beer. Spritzy carbonation. Semi-dry to dry finish.   Overall a very nice take on the triple style. This is one of those beers I tend to drink every once in a while and absolutely love it when I do.","  rDev Always glad to find classic to review.  a) Pours mostly clear, light bronze, mostly translucent, slashing lace.  s) Coconut, vanilla, candied, bourbon, wood, cedar. t) All the above, with yeast, wine-like tannins, more woods, dark stone fruits, bourbon soaked, and cellar must alongside.  f) Creamy and yet powdery, a bit sweet, after dinner drink. o) Curious classic indeed. Top Tripel, but must like the coconut, bourbon trend.","  rDev 2012 Vintage 750ml cork &amp; cage bottle poured into a snifter  A- pours crystal clear and golden in color with a one-finger foamy white head that has short retention  S- aroma opens with apple juice, pears, rye bread, clove, banana, basement must, peppercorn, just a hint of wet oak &amp; vanilla  T- ripe pears and apples up front, followed by some yeasty notes of clove and peppercorn. Mid-palate gives a hint of bourbon barrel, adding light oak and vanilla. The finish is spicy with some phenolic notes   M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly warming finish  O- hides the abv well, lots of apple and pear notes coming out","  rDev Bottled on 10/23/19  Pours a hazed deep golden straw body capped with a cascading multiple fingers of eggshell white foam; impressive head retention as the body sparkles with a lasting effervescence; as the head fades, a decadent, silky cap, dense collar of creamy froth, and thick walling of layered lacing hold firm.  Aroma opens with green banana touched by vanilla bean accents and oaky yeast undertones; the middle imparts a richer note with estery banana creme and dried clove, while it finishes with subtle peppercorn spice and flambéed citrus zest for a soft, rounded bouquet.  Taste brings out herbal clove to start, phasing into stewed apple and orange as bits of coconut cream accentuate the mid-palate; toasted vanilla bean offers a unique and cohesive smoothness as banana and bourbon peak welcomingly on the finish.  Mouthfeel provides a medium-light body, at times casually thin and inconsistent, though bolstered with an amplified moderate-high carbonation; a varied mid-palate features a chalk-dry prickle building into a brief creamy interlude before resuming a dry finish, highlighted by a bright, robust peak into a tinge of boozy warmth on the back end.  Imbued with the delicate integration of the bourbon barrel and a general hesitance to overwhelm on any aspect, this becomes a plush yet vibrant tripel bringing forth some of the more impressive drinkability for a barrel-aged beer I've come across.","  rDev 12oz bottled 11-13-19. Opened 3-21-19. 3 finger white head (rocky and dese) that doesn't budge...excellent retention. Pale golden color with a slight haze and some poured sediment in suspension. Ample lacing. Apple, yeast, and lots of spice. The barrel character isn't dominant but if you get your nose down in the bowl it's definitely there with a wet wood and light vanilla aroma. Stone fruit with grassy and noble hops. Apricot and apple. Clove spice. Rich flavors in general with a bit of the vanilla and barrel coming in late. Bright entry, light to medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Very lengthy off-dry finish with a faint but noticeable grassy hop mixed in. Outstanding.","  rDev Poured from bottle into tulip, nice 2 finger cream colored head, so so retention, great lacing. Clear bright golden in the glass, some yeast got past my pour, but otherwise a beautiful beer. Smells of cracker grain, slight juicy fruit and very slight bourbon notes. Taste is initially sweet malt, candied sugar, mild belgian fruity esters the bourbon and vanilla show up slightly in the middle, very deft hand with the barrel aging, mild coconut on the finish with a firm bitterness. Mouthfeel is great, tending to finish more on the dry side than sweet side, makes this a really easy drinking beer. Lots of tripels will have a cloying sweetness that makes it almost impossible to finish. Also had to do a double take when I saw this was 11%, drinks like it is way less.","  rDev Bottled 10/23/19  Pours an opaque gold with 1 finger of white head that sticks around for a while, leaves really nice lacing  I'll admit, I'm a bit off-put by the smell here. It's similar in aroma to their  White  which I was a bit too generous rating, because as I went on, the coriander smell just threw it off for me. That's what I get here, distinctly Belgian. There are mild vanilla and citrus notes, but I absolutely do not pick up on any barrel character  Ok, the barrel comes through a bit more in the taste, but not much. It stays pretty similar to the White, but almost like a more mature version. Malty sweet in the beginning with a spicy and citrusy snap mid palate, this finishes semi sweet  For a beer this size, it drinks really easy. The carbonation is level and keeps things from getting heavy  Overall, not my favorite thing in the world. It's my first Tripel, and maybe I was just expecting something different, but I still enjoyed this, and I'd imagine it'd do well with some age","  rDev Look: The beer pours translucent, slightly hazy, pale gold color. The off white head eventually disappears leaving some lacing in its wake, and a thick ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Some visible carbonation with tiny streams of bubbles floating up.  Smell: Smooth bourbon notes of vanilla, caramel and honey. Cinnamon spice, baked apple/pear, ripe banana bread. A really wonderful aroma and this is the first time it hits me that this beer smells like bourbon, without the high ABV.  Taste: Up front some sweeter bourbon like flavors including vanilla and coconut. Mid palate the fruit and banana come through. The finish is just wonderful. It dries out a bit and takes on a bold bread-like character.  Feel: Medium level of carbonation. Gentle sweetness upfront with a more dry finish. Pleasant warmth as appreciated in the stle.  Overall: I am revisiting this beer which I rated 4.25, and I am enjoying it so much that i am bumping my rating on taste and overall from 4.25 to 4.5. Such a great aroma where the bourbon shines and the fruity, Belgian-yeast flavors, coupled with the malt profile all shine beautifully.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a tulip. Bottled 1/24/19, so 3 1/2 months old.  Slightly hazy golden yellow body. Small slow streams of carbonation replenish a small white head leaving decent lacing.  Not much on the nose, faintly alcohol.  For a bba drink, this is quite subtle. Other than the sweetness and the finishing bitterness, none of the base beer comes through. A little vanilla, warmth and bitterness towards the end.  Mouth is between medium and full, finish a light bourbon warmth and a final bitterness.  Overall, a very different drink to their base tripel, but just as enjoyable.","  rDev Bottled 08/01/18. Can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this beer up until this point. Had to revisit it as it’s an accessible and affordable barrel-aged beer and an incredible example of the talent of Allagash. Their Tripel is the standard in that category so it’s amazing that it can be approved upon, but that’s what happened with this beer. Has all the flavor of the Tripel but with a bit more sweetness, some syrupy notes of bourbon, and a hint of wood from the barrel. An approachable yet special beer. Stellar job, Allagash!","  rDev L:. Pours a pretty cloudy orange with a medium white head and several fingers of lacing.  S:. Sweet coconut and vanilla, with notes of a sweet brown sugar and bourbon.  T:. Sweet coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, some bourbon, a bit of spiciness, quite sweet.  F:. Medium body, slightly prickly carbonation.  O:. This is solid bit not my favorite tripel.","  rDev Had on tap. This must be very fresh as the bourbon flavor smacks you right in the face with both the aroma and flavor. Perhaps would be better balanced with age, but still plenty tasty as it is.","  rDev 750 ml bottle, corked and caged, May 2018 bottling, bottled on 5/9/18. Pours slightly hazy straw yellow with a medium creamy white head that retains fairly well and laces the glass some.  The aroma is sweet grains and cracker malt with some Belgian funk and some vanilla and booze.  The flavor is sweet grainy malts with some Belgian spice and earthy funk and a vanilla bourbon finish. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.  Overall, a nice sipping beer. More comes out as it warms.","  rDev ** 12/04/18  Bottle to goblet.

O: been wanting to grab a bottle of this again, procrastinating on reviewing it; had it a few times on tap in the interim - after looking for single 12 oz'ers without luck, purchased a bomber on sale, knowing full well I'd be going at it alone - of course, I find singles in a bottle shop in PA yesterday, jfc... this is a splendid beer, and I'd be inclined to grab a glass whenever possible, but the BB aging, though resulting in a tasty variation, doesn't quite strike the same strident chords and melodies as a bottle-conditioned bomber of their base Tripel - sorry, I much prefer that... at any rate, an elegant brew, and one of the better BB-aged light-colored beers  (originally rated 3.75 for draft serving, 18 Dec 2012)","  rDev I recently had curieux from Allagash and like so many other of their offerings it was great.  Look: Hazy light yellow with a thick chalk white head  Aroma: yeast, banana, grapefruit, mild bourbon  Taste: It's sweet, yeasty, the flavor is like yeasty banana bread with a mild bitter hop flavor (grapefruit peel) some alcohol flavor and a hint of bourbon.  Feel: smooth medium body","  rDev Ale aged in Oak Bourbon barrels (their triple, for 8 weeks), 11% ABV, Bottling November 10, 2015, reviewed 5/14/18. Brewed with Allagash 2-Row Malted Barley Blend and hopped with Nugget and Hallertau. (They fail to mention on the Curieux page that they brew the tripel with white cane sugar)   First brewed back in 2004, Curieux was our first foray into barrel aging. To make Curieux, we take our Tripel and let it age in bourbon barrels for seven weeks. Once that time is up, we take the beer out of our cold cellars and blend it back with a portion of fresh Tripel. The resulting rich, golden ale features smooth notes of coconut, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon.   Pours out to a cloudy golden peach, forming a tall white head with very good retention and solid lacing. Carbonation is moderate, ~2.5-3 carbs, not spritzy like many bottle conditioned Belgians. The nose is interesting, at first, very much straight apple juice, then a little pear nectar, then some muted phenols. Not as spicy in the nose as I was expecting. I love bourbon and know it well, but I don't get any bourbon in the nose. The mouthfeel is medium dense body, lightly syrupy and definitely warming as it goes down. Not astringent. The taste again, is of apple juice and pear nectar, overall on the sweet side, some moderate bitterness just in the very tail end, and a quite warm blast of alcohol in the middle and end.  There are some very harsh alcohols that make it very difficult to drink as it warms up. Unfortunately, the rest of this bottle will be a drain pour.   A worthy but failed attempt. I respect Allagash and like almost everything they brew, but this beer is an unfortunate exception. The alcohol is harsh and fierce, something I don't enjoy. I wouldn't buy this again, nor can I recommend it.","  rDev This is an amazing tripel that is tasty, complex and very enjoyable. It features all the typical aromas and flavors of a tripel with the addition of mild bourbon notes and some vanilla and cinnamon. A long and fairly sweet finish. Very mild carbonation and a thick and very chewy mouthfeel.","  rDev Light copper colored with some light haziness within the body. There's a fingernail of off white around half of the rim and covering about half of the top. I smell light Belgian candy sugar and lightly vinous Belgian triple yeast. The taste is sweet light Belgian candy sugar, lightly tart Belgian triple yeast, and just a splash of sweet bourbon. The mouth is very dry and yet smooth from the barrel aging. If I had not seen the ABV on the bottle I would have guessed along the lines of 8 or 9%!"]},{"Name":"Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35/108/","Brewery":"Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams)","Style":"Fruit and Field Beer","Alcohol":5.30,"Score":73.0,"Comments":["  rDev Best by 3/2022  You know, as stupid as it may sound, this was one of the first beers I searched for when I began drinking underage. Me and my friends lusted after it but were never able to secure it. Flash forward years later, and I find singles of it at my local store. For the hell of it, I picked one up just to see for myself what I was missing years ago (probably not much)  Pours a cloudy gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  Oh man, the cherry here is super artificial in the nose, very candy-like. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry jolly rancher, lime juice, crackery malt, earthy wheat, and light honey  While the aroma was definitely candy forward, it also promised a fruity tartness. The taste is a huge letdown in the wake of this, not very good at all. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, cracker, sweet honey, and lemon rind. The swallow takes a nose dive in quality, bringing notes of cherry cough syrup, doughy malt, earthy wheat, and sticky seeet honey  A promising start of a light body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a refreshing beer. But it finishes sad and sticky, just way too sweet  Ok so it’s not the worst thing in the world, but it’s pretty amusing to see what younger me was missing. Not worth repeating","  rDev A: crystal clear; medium gold in color; with a fairly aggressive pour, a 1.5 finger ivory head that receded to a skim cap; very little lacing;  S: cherry, but with a tinge of throat lozenge;  T: pretty close to cherry cough syrup; very mild bitterness at the end;  M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;  O: not something I would come back to;","  rDev Pours a slightly foggy deep orange with two fingers of dense, white foam atop. Head retention is okay. Aroma is strong cherry, which comes of artificial - akin to a cherry throat lozenge. Additional notes of wheat, biscuity, bready, earthy malts and very light herbal and citrusy hop notes work to balance out the aroma, but cherry is 90% of it. Flavor profile is cherry right out front, which drinks a bit like cherry cough syrup. Syrupy, herbal, resiny, and citrusy hops add a little completeness within the hop side, but do little to balance. Malts, which come by way of earthy, bready and biscuity, also do little to balance. It's sickly sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thin with a fizzily, fuzzy texture that feels more like a cola on the tongue than a beer. Overall, while it certainly delivers on the cherry note, it's woefully unbalanced and artificial tasting making for a lackluster experience.  Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.","  rDev Looks pretty good. Hazy orange amber, decent head that settles to a full film, good lacing.  North American style wheat —brittle, metallic, thin bodied. That’s overlaid by the flavour of sweet maraschino cherries. The nose is also maraschino cherries. Just a novelty beer, nothing special.","  rDev This was one of my wife's favorites back when we were first getting acquainted with beer, and I'll still occasionally bring some home as a surprise. I haven't had one in years, though, and this is a lot different than what I remembered. Maybe my palate is different, maybe I was colored by nostalgia, but this is really sweet on the cherry in the nose. Much less comes through on the palate, which is otherwise fairly nondescript.","  rDev I remember drinking this one years ago and it seemed decent then - but tried it again now and it’s just way too sweet for me. Nice golden-brown color, mild head with minimal lingering lacing. Smells primarily of cherry. Tastes strongly of cherry, not quite medicinal but close to it. Some faint hints of wheat, but it’s very faint. Decent carbonation, very thin mouthfeel. Just too sweet for my taste.","  rDev A very strong artifical cherry smell that was hard to get past. Just lifting it to drink it the small hits you in the face and just takes over. The base beer might have been decent but again tough to tell due to cough medicine aroma","  rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass. best by may 2018, so well inside the wire here.   slightly hazy yellow body, small white head leaving some lacing. light carbonation.   smells like cherry cough syrup. i do not like cherry cough syrup.   ugh. tastes like cherry cough syrup too, at first anyway. then there is a musty barnyard taste.   mouth around medium, finish initially cherry, then mouldy.   overall, barely got through a few ounces before drainpouring it. might be even worse than their cranberry lambic.","  rDev Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is hazy gold/copper, head is off white with fine bubbles, good lacing on the glass and good lingering presence.  Smell is - somewhere between maraschino cherry juice and cherry cough syrup with a hint of biscuit malt - off putting for the most part but the wheat presents more as it warms.  Taste is biscuit wheat for a split second then overtaken by the cherry juice, with that artificial twang - struggling through this tasting...  Mouthfeel is bitter, sharp, and strong astringent like quality.   Overall - a beer I'm not enjoying and will have to pour out the rest.","  rDev There is a fine line between cherry cough syrup and sweet cherry (as opposed to sour cherry) flavor in beer. To me this barely came down on the non-medicinal side of things. I enjoyed it. My wife hated it. Won't be buying again.","  rDev ** ~1995 Used to really like this before I liked good beer.   **","  rDev Let me just say I cannot stand this beer and I have no idea why I tried it again. It tastes like cherry flavored cough syrup and is incredibly sweet. I would rather drink Robitussin.","  rDev Hazy orange, long lasting foam. Smells of cough drops, cherry cough drops and wheat. Same with the taste and I like. Colour me strange. Bottle at Old Chicago, BB May 2017.","  rDev Rich, hazy gold color with white cap and lace. I don't usually find hazy brews that attractive but this one has a sort of luminescence about it.  Maraschino cherry aroma wafting up from the glass. That's the scent but it comes across as a dry one without the sweetness I associate with that style of cherry.  Taste like a mild wheat beer with a low hop level and very clean yeast that left virtually no trace of having been there. Imposed on this is a rich maraschino cherry flavor that dominates the field like a single spotlight shining on the 50 yard line.  Texture is medium with balancing carbonation.  Ok, it tastes like cherry which comes as no surprise since that information is printed on the label. How much like cherry you ask? Well, a whole lot which I guess is sorta the point. These light wheat beers can be flavored with a lot of things and said things usually become the dominant taste. Same thing here in spades.","  12oz bottle BB September 2017 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 5.3% ABV 23 IBU. The beer is a hazy orange yellow color with off white head. The head starts thick and settles to a film coat and leaves significant lacing behind. The smell is strong with candy cherry as the label indicates real cherries and natural flavors. The taste is mixed tart cherry and a hint of wheat &amp; malt up front. The finish is artificial cherry that persists on the tongue for a moment mimicking cherry candy again. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, strongly carbonated and dry. Overall, good. For anyone with an aversion to typical beer flavors, this might be the ticket. No real malt or bitterness. It's still well put together but not a favorite for me.","  rDev I may actually participate in NBS (Week 615) since I plan to run through as much of my remaining Samuel Adams Bottle Backlog as possible today! Happy, happy, joy, joy!   From the bottle:  A flavorful American wheat ale brewed in the tradition of using native ingredients. We use Michigan cherries for a tart character and a touch of honey for a slight sweetness that's combined with a crisp cereal note and Noble hops for a bright and refreshing flavor. Cheers! [undersigned] Jim Koch .  I feel the need to be upfront on this one. The last time that I drank one, back in 2012, I felt like I might have had a mild allergic reaction to it. If I need to wrap up the review before drinking the whole bottle, please be understanding.   Upon Pop!ping the cap, I decided to go with a hard pour since, as a wheat beer, cloudiness is acceptable &amp; to be expected. The result was three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head like meringue atop the liquid. Color was a hazy, not really cloudy, Golden-Amber (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7), causing the snobbish Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas &amp; Croesus to remain on my living room couch, watching football since they go for 24-karat clarity. Nose definitely has a cherry cough drop quality! Well put, rodbeermunch! Mouthfeel was kind of thin and light, not precisely watery, but close. The taste was really sweet and I would have guessed artificial. The Michigan cherries were utterly wasted. The taste reminded me of Duncan Hines Cherry cake icing and was sickeningly sweet. Blah! It's actually giving me a headache. No wonder I disliked it four years ago. Finish was sweet, almost candy-like and not my thing at all. Man, even if they deign to CAN this at some point, I will be hard-pressed to return to it.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours a golden color with a medium white head. Aroma is dominated by cherry.

It is certainly refreshing, however, the artificial quality bothered me a bit. Not as good as I used to think it was.","  rDev They still make barf in a bottle? I keed, I keed. Pours a golden color that is lacking any notion of a pink or red cherry hue. 1/2  white head. Aroma is a blend of cherry Sucrets and grain.   Taste is like, you think its a fruited wheat beer, but you're not sure at the end of the day. The cherry is so big you start to think you're taking Nyquil or something, very medicinal strong. The alcohol seems heavier than 5%. Like sweet honey all over it, needs something to balance it out.   I dunno, SA has a difficult time when its the exotic stuff.","  rDev Had this one straight from the bottle. Aroma was sweet cherry syrup tempered by wheat bread. Taste follows, with the cherry flavor coming through crisp and sweet, and not cloying or artificial. This could be the light cherry ale I've been looking for.","  rDev I had this beer at the Carolina Ale House in Columbia, SC. Served from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The aroma was of wheat and cherry extract, not bad. Appearance- The beer had a nice golden color. Taste- This was the drawback for me, the flavor was overpowering on the fake cherry flavoring.

It recedes at a steady pace within the next several minutes, caking the glass with loads of sticky, messy, stringy lace in the process; the eventual remnants include a patchy cap and a generous collar of soapy suds. Looks great to me. The nose includes an enticing blend of floral, citrusy hops, joined by hints of wheaty grains and bread, as well as a touch of resiny, spicy hops.  This is a fine pale ale, displaying good balance between the malt and hop flavours - I'm getting wheaty bread and a touch of caramelized sweetness at first, with citrusy notes of orange and pink grapefruit cropping up not long after. It finishes moderately bittersweet, with suggestions of pine needles, spicy hops and light floral bitterness rounding out the tail end of the sip. Medium in body, with moderate carbonation levels that gently brush against the surface of the palate, giving a little bit of crispness to this pale ale's very smooth, slightly slick mouthfeel. Tasty and easy to pour down the hatch; at 5.7% I'd hesitate to call it a true session option, even though I could potentially see myself having a few cans in a row anyhow.  Final Grade: 3.97, a high B+. SweetWater's 420 Extra is one of the more old school American-style pale ales on the market, and now that I've tried it, it's not hard to see why it has been around for so long. It's hoppy, sure, but its Cascade and Centennial hop flavours are deftly balanced by its robust malt bill - and the end result is a highly drinkable ale that I will totally be picking up again in the future.

Thin off-white/pink ring of foam with an occasional island of lacing.   Smell: Raspberry, with a tiny bit of sour tang to it.   Taste: Nice tart rapspberry tempered with some sweetness, and a lingering fruity bitter/tart finish. Very nice!  Mouthfeel: Slick, a bit sticky, good carbonation. Dry finish.   Overall / Drinkability: This really is a great raspberry beer. I'd easily say this is a raspberry lambic, and a very well balanced one. Easily drinkable and I could pair this with a variety of desserts. I'm a bit surprised it's listed as a  Fruit and Field  beer given the character and the way the brewers make it. Well done and I definitely would want another.","  rDev Part of the midwestern milieu migrated my direction thanks to @FBarber in NBS BIF #13.  Rusty, plum juice red colour. Small wet head that quickly disappears leaving nothing but a few stray bubbles.   Nose has some sweet and tart of the raspberries that honestly kind of reminds me of marinara sauce. Ultimately beyond that there's deep aged berry aroma, like a raspberry wine.   Oooh man. Honestly, that's fucking delicious. It is raspberry juice. It is what it is. But I love raspberries. Late season berries, deep red, cool, just a touch of bramble tart. Jammy and delicious.  Moderate body I suppose, with a dry finish in contrast to the jammy berry carrying tool, and spicy/sharp/compressed carbonation.   I'll be honest. I love raspberry. And that strongly colours my review here. But that's an important component of it. New Glarus is really good at what they do. This beer is yet another NG brew that is blatantly competently composed, and in this case (as opposed to some of the other NG brews I've been fortunate enough to try), that happens to also align with a fruit expression that is right up my alley. This is easily my favourite of the New Glarus fruit beers I've tried, and now I'm sad I only have the one bottle.  Thanks Frank for sending it my direction! Cheers!","  rDev Bottle poured into a new glarus stemmed glass  Fizzy off white foam two finger cap over a reddish brown cola liquid , settles to a thin layer   Aroma is tart raspberry jam   Taste is full flavored raspberries, sweet tart,   Medium sudsing , raspberry taste lingers, sweet tart   Good beer","  rDev Great balance of sweet &amp; acidic, bursting with jammy raspberries and finishing with a refreshing pucker.

Tart raspberries, apples, pears; sweet fruit finish. Light body; zippy carbonation; dry oak barrel feel. Delicious fruit sour; long tart berries linger; one of my favorites.","  rDev No bottling date (presumably 2019 bottling)  Pours a deep brownish-purple body with little clarity and topped with a creamy finger or so of rosé-hued head; decent retention results in a spotty cap, lasting frothy collar, and a thin spatter of webby lacing caked lightly around the glass.  Aromaa starts with raspberries from the vine with an herbal, vinous touch transitioning into into fresh-pressed raspberry juice coursing throughout the whole of the bouquet; hints of green apple skin present around the edges, with prune in the distant backdrop.  Taste offers a dose of freeze-dried raspberry sorbet quickly taking on my intense jammy notes of preserves and the sweetness of bready pie filling; lactic sweetness and vanilla add further depth to the dark berry tones over the mid-palate into the finish; the fresh, natural intensity of the raspberry is truly impressive here, and is advanced in its one-dimensionality.  Mouthfeel brings a densely textured medium body supported with a building, upper-level carbonation; wisps of acidity settle over a fairly dry mid-palate and become thicker, smoother, and jammier toward the finish; a mild lactic tartness persists from the backdrop.  An uncanny natural depth and intensity brings a fruit beer swinging far above its weight class, with a marriage of tart and sweet elements becoming particularly appealing as a level to the dense overlay of dominant raspberry. This brew fully embraces the drinkable and expressive characteristics of its style, with resoundingly positive effects.","  rDev Bottle courtesy of JohnnyHopps.  Looks like red/pink juice with fluffy carbonation with pink foam.  Taste and smell predominantly sweet raspberries. Nice sweet and tart flavors. No alcohol presence. Mouthfeel of fruit punch. Maybe a little thicker. Fairly high carbonation.  Very similar to Lindeman’s raspberry lambic.","  rDev OMFG!

I Pop!ped the cap &amp; started a very slow, gentle, C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. It foamed much like champagne, forming a rolling, fizzy, rocky finger of pinkish head with very low retention, quickly falling away to wisps.

This was the sort of thing that I like to savor on a hot, humid Summer's day from a cold ice bath in the cooler. Finish was tart &amp; semi-dry, lingering with the taste of raspberries.

The smell is raspberry jam with hints of raspberry vinaigrette and even hints of wine.  The taste is loaded with raspberry flavor. It kind of reminds me of Rubaeus up front. There is some tartness in the middle along with ever so slight hints of vinegar. Sweetness lingers along with a bit of tartness in the finish.

There may be a little apple and cherry in there, too, but the raspberry dominates: sweet without being sickly sweet. Fresh, juicy goodness.  The mouthfeel is superb. Slick and full with a nice sofa-like carbonation cutting through.  You have to be in the mood for fruit juice, but when you are, nobody does it better than New Glarus.","  rDev Dark ruby red with a fingernail of off white. The aroma is of a pint of freshly picked raspberries. Amazing! I'm tasting exceptionally tart, fresh raspberries.

Served in a MadTree teku, the beer pours a mostly clear dark reddish color with about an inch off-white head with a tinge of pink. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like fresh raspberries, both tart and sweet. Taste is similar to the aroma, with sweet and tart raspberry and raspberry jam flavors. There's also some caramel, dark bread, woody and brown sugar flavors noticeable too. Have to say I think it's a little more sweet than tart, but still very, very fruity! Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Soft mouthfeel with nice crisp finish.  O - This is a tremendous fruit beer. The raspberry is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Liquid raspberry jam.","  rDev Beautiful deep red raspberry color with pinkish cap and lacing.  Scent of ripe raspberries that manages to smell both tart and sweet.  Taste just like it smells. I don't know if the word tart refers to the fruit or is a reference to pastry but the term works either way. I think, on the whole, dry tartness wins out over fruit sweetness but these rather simple flavors are well matched and mingled.  Medium texture with balancing carbonation.  Overall I think it's a very good example of a fruit flavored ale.","  rDev A 1 pint 9 fl. oz. bottle with no bottled on or best before date (but I think 2017 designed labels). Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.  Appearance: A cloudy deep dark grape red colour with a nice big three finger beige head that dissipated fairly quickly while leaving some sticky lacing.  Aroma: Tart, jammy, raspberry, mixed berry jello.  Taste: Sweet, tart, raspberry jam, raspberry jello with a touch of oak.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with low carbonation.  Overall: Great aromas, but tastes probably too sweet for me. The raspberry jammy and jello flavours were nice, but because of the over sweetness, this turned into just a sipper for me.","  rDev 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/23/2018. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.

Light-moderate increasing dryness from tart/spiciness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/acidic/tangy, fairly crisp, and lightly tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. Overall this is an awesome fruit beer. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries, fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly tart/spicy/drying finish. Great balance of fruit, yeast, oak, and malts. Lacking the enormous jammy fruit character of all of the other New Glarus fruit beers, but still really enjoyable.","  rDev Raspberry red body; head starts thick and fizzy, fades to a thin wisp. Prominent notes of ripe raspberry in the aroma. Raspberry, cranberry and cherry flavors abound. Heavy, juicy body; tart and acidic.  New Glarus promises raspberries with this beer, and that's what you get. This type of beer is more of a gimmick to me, but the brewery certainly hit its mark, especially if this sort of beer is your thing.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Stamped on bottle is '70816W2120710'. Slightly murky, reddish amber colored body. Pinkish white colored two finger head settles to thick cap. A few scattered spots of lacing. Raspberry and wheat/fruity aromas. Raspberry taste is true to the berry and is not artificial or juice extract influenced. Sweet with a true base tartness. Includes a little oak barrel and bready malt. Mouth feel is medium and somewhat syrupy, to support the berry. About a true to the raspberry fermented beverage as could be. So flavorful, and great feedback through the mouth.","  rDev Appearance - Pours reddish brown with a pink, near finger's width head. Sub-par retention results in mostly barren surface with a thin ring around the edge of glass. A few broken lines and some spotting make up the lace.  Smell - Raspberry, lemony tartness and hints of toasted malt.  Taste - Follows the nose. Tart raspberry with a light, lemony undertone and kissed by fruity, sugary sweetness. Hints of toasted bread. Light oak woodiness emerges in the finish. Aftertaste finds a dominant sourness still lingering, while hints of the oak and toast fade in and out.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied with a plentiful amount of bitey, effervescent carbonation. Crisp, easy drinker with a slightly dry finish.  Overall - Very lovely sour. Lots of tartness with none of the 'gastric acid' flavor that some are burdened with. Definitely one I'll have to pick up again if I'm ever back in the distribution area.","  rDev 12oz bottle (happy to see 12oz instead of the traditional 750mL!) Reddish-brown pour with a creamy pinkish-tan head. Sweet raspberries fill the nose, reminiscent of my grandma's homemade raspberry jam. Again, very sweet in taste as well with plenty of sugared raspberries that have retained some tartness, faint oaky vanilla, and earthy hops. Medium body, higher carbonation, finishes dry and tart. Overall, I've waited years to finally try this. I think it met expectations even though it is quite sweet. Either way, it was a great sweet treat to finally try!","  rDev This beer is special to me I have been hauling this bottle all over with me as I have moved a few time over the last couple years. This beer is at least 2 years old. It took me a few years to acquire this bottle. This beer marks my 995th beer that I have tried or rated on BA. Poured into a pint glass at 37 degrees. A two finger head with poor retention. The color of the beer is medium brown color with reddish hues (duh). The clarity of the beer is opaque. I was not expecting much of a head on this beer, so everything checks out.   The beer smell like Raspberry jam had a love child with beer. The malt is caramel, with toasty malty notes. There is a light note of earth and floral.   The beer is predominantly Raspberry with a subtle honey sweetness with toasted malt, caramel, yeast, floral, earth, and citrus.   The body of the beer is medium, the carbonation is medium minus, the finish is medium.   This beer is just amazing, I love the balance in this beer. It is not overly jammy or overly malty. This has to be the best Fruit beer I have ever tried. Very well made. Love the slight citrus notes at the end to give the beer some character. I just will end the night with this beer.","  rDev A - Dark, ruby red body, semi-transparent, with a lightly pink-tinted head, short and quick to fade, and minor lacing of tight bubble.  S - Full of raspberry notes, a lactic aspect, and a vegetal hit of cut grass.  T - This is a pleasure, with rich raspberry flesh being paramount, a bit of apple juice, and a close of bright acidity that trails slowly into a juicy end.  M - Brisk open, tart with some prickliness in the back.  O - One of the best raspberry beers I have ever had. The flavor, which could so easily have tilted into syrup as so many I've had do, is fresh and surprisingly clean. Superb.","  rDev A: Poured into a tulip glass to a deep red topped by a dense and fluffy two finger head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing S: Smells of sweet and juicy raspberries and that's pretty much it. It smells great T: Taste is tons of juicy fresh raspberries with just a hint of tartness and some slight notes of oak. Swallow is more juicy raspberries and lingering tartness with a little more oak. M: This beer has a medium amount of body with a slightly silky mouthfeel. The carbonation is effervescent and very nice while the beer has a slightly drying finish. O: Overall this beer is absolutely killer. It has some great fruit forward flavors while the base beer does some minimal work in the background. Easily a benchmark for the style.","  rDev Aged one year in my cellar.   Strawberry jam colored body, opaque in spots and clearer in others. It's gorgeous. A bubble gum pink head adorns the crown of the glass with 2 fingers of head.   Lots of jammy aromas - like a mix of raspberry and strawberry jam. A sharp citric acid note behind that.   Sublimely simple and complex at the same time. Flavor is a burst of fresh raspberry jam, sour strawberry tops, and a lemon-lime sorbet flavor towards the finish. It drinks itself.   Feel is heavily carbonated, but thick enough to give it a berry fruit smoothie-like consistency.   Overall - this beer is a delicacy. It's highly sought after for a reason. And it's just. so. good."]},{"Name":"Honker's Ale","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1146/1157/","Brewery":"Goose Island Beer Co.","Style":"Bitter - English","Alcohol":4.30,"Score":83.0,"Comments":["  rDev Pours a red copper color with a khaki head , Smell and taste was dark fruits,toffee and caramel,baked bread malts .

Aroma is toasted malt, sugary caramel, yeast and a burnt hint with a thin hop character. Taste is malty toast with a hint of char, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, cream and yeast backed by a hoppy bitterness. Average at best, To tell the truth I'm a little disappointed based on what I have come to expect from this brewery. Taste more like a bitter Amber Ale than an English Bitter.","  rDev 12oz bottle dated 21SEP18 poured into my mouth looks awful, but I remember it being more on the dirty orange end of the color scale and with active bubbly carbonation.  Aroma is flowery, fruity hops and that flows into the flavor to which is added a good caramel malt for balance.  Mouthfeel is lighter with a slight stickiness.   Overall this is very much like beer.","  rDev One of those beers you just happen to come across because somebody bought a mix pack and you grabbed the one beer you hadn't tried before. Living in England, I find it interesting that this is listed as an English bitter. I wouldn't have guessed that from just drinking it. It strikes me as more of an American amber...but whatever. There is just a light whiff of fruity hops, and actually the hops are reasonably pronounced in the flavor. Somewhat malty. Honestly, this beer sort of a forgettable in between beer. It reminds me of what small brew pubs used to make in the 90s when all they had was a light, amber, and dark beer to choose from. Just okay.","  rDev Goose Island Beer Co.  Honker's Ale  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle,  BOTTLED ON DATE: 01NOV17 08:47   Notes via stream of consciousness: Honker's and I go way back to when I went to Siebel in Chicago and Goose Island was our unofficial pub. I certainly drank a lot of it back then, and then strangely I seem to have forgotten all about it. Well that's at least partially because that was 1995 and I couldn't get it back home. Anyway, it's poured a creamy finger-thick head of off-white for me atop a surprisingly hazy copper body. The aroma is brightly floral with some roses, fruity with apple and perhaps a hint of pear, and gently earthy and mineralish. It's very English in character, and I wonder why you don't see more beers like these lately. Moving on... the flavor follows the aroma as is usually the case, with some added lightly caramelish, grainy, and even honeyish malt and a bit of leafy and tea-like character from the hops. It's really nicely rounded with all of the components being clear enough that you can find them on their own, but also working with everything else to create a  whole . A median bitterness balances it (the label notes 30 IBUs) and it finishes mostly dry with some residual malt and plenty of floral, fruit, and softly mineralish notes lingering. The body is medium, and in keeping with the English character it's only softly carbonated giving it a smooth mouthfeel. Very nicely done. The only knock I have against it is that the head retention and lacing could be better but at the same time I'm not sure if the glass I'm using is actually  beer clean  so I'll have to give it a pass. Easily one of the best American brewed English-style bitters on the market.","  rDev On draught at Old Chicago April 11, 2015.

Easy to drink but not one that I'd reach for terribly often.","  rDev A 12 fl oz bottle, bottled on 18th November 2016 and best before 18th November 2017. Poured into a Mikkeller pint glass.  Appearance: A nice clear copper colour with a one finger off white head that slowly dissipates to a nice thin creamy layer while leaving curtain like lacing.  Aroma: A bit light, but what I do get was grassy, nutty, sweet malt and hints of toffee.  Taste: Toasty biscuit malt, caramel, nuttiness with hints of orange citrus.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: Not my favourite style, but this is easy to drink.","  rDev Goose Island Honkers Ale, 4.3% ABV, 30 IBU. Pours amber and thick, with one finger white head, left little lacing. Nose is nutty and malt, taste is nutty and malty sweetness, very little hop bitterness at the close - surprised others are saying it is too bitter. Good mouthfeel, perhaps a bit heavy on carbonation. Overall very good.","  rDev Amber orange color with a thin head. Aroma with notes of mild pine, some caramels and English hops. Flavor with notes of caramels, earthy and spicy hops, mild ginger, slightly toasted malts, tea and some yellow fruit citrusy. Dry aftertaste with a medium but persistent bitterness. Light body with appropriate carbonation of tiny bubbles. Pleasant English Bitter, perfectly balanced and very easy to drink. I could have a few in a blink.","  rDev Copper to light brown appearance, 1/2  off white head. A fractional amount of lace on the glass. Aroma hits with those light balsa wood notes, and a very slight amount of hops.  Taste really hits its stride as America meets ESB. Hops are there, plenty of bready malt feels, earthy. Lots of flavor in a low abv beer. I enjoy this one.","  rDev Appearance: Clear light gold, white cap and good lacing.  Aroma: Something light yeast bread about it, a bit of hops.  Taste: Good flavor for a low ABV brew, tasty, caramely malty, not a whole lot but what's there counts. Malt carries with hops riding along. The darker malts used have a touch more roastiness than I would choose for this type beer. The roast bitterness carries through the finish leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste. Or that could be hops as well but the bitter note is off putting.  Texture: Medium body, good heft to it.   Overall: Good example of what can be done with a mild brew. If I were calorie counting this would certainly be on the list.","  rDev Clear copper with a big, lightweight off-white head that never gives up the fight.  Not much aroma wafts off this foam, with some floral, crisp lager-like notes faintly present, and some banana sugar as it warms.  It might sound heavy, but some nutty, caramel notes are refreshing and light, with a little raisin and light roast coffee supporting them. Bready and toasty qualities are present as well.  Dry finish, bitter, yet sweet.","  rDev We know that a commercial success is not always a great beer. Hence, Honker's. To me, Honker's is one of the handful of success stories in evolving craft brewing so that it could reach larger markets. Selling itself now as  fruity hop aroma  (I find it pleasant) and  malty middle  (I agree a bit less), this remains a very adequate session beer ... if there are not a dozen alternatives. To me, the hops come on too strong, particularly drying in the after-taste... but the market tends to like that. (Give me a tad more sweet malt, but I also know I'm an outlier on Honker's marketing curve.)  Reviewed in Roger Protz'  300 Beers To Try Before You Die!  and written before the AB purchase was fait accompli.","  rDev Pours clear copper color with a 1-2 finger foamy beige colored head that faded slowly and left decent spotty lacing.  Smells of toasted grains, light yeast, floral hops, caramel, light lemon zest and cardboard. Earthy notes come out along with some citrus and blend in well with the malt base. Smells nice but very basic and nothing really jumps out - it's a very even smelling brew with equal parts hops and malts.  Tastes very much like it smells with sweet malt, caramel, toasted grains, yeast, floral hops, lemon zest, tea leaf, a little grapefruit bunch of earthy notes. Some more pronounced fruity flavors come out but can't get past the malt base, so like the aroma it's a very even tasting with equal parts hops and just a little stronger malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel is light and almost smooth, with mild carbonation, a hint of bitterness and a malty/grainy sweetness that trails off with toffee or caramel and a semi-dry feel.  Overall it's a good basic beer and seems to fit the English Bitter style quite well.","  Clear copper color with a bit of beige head. Aroma has some sweet malts, honey and sweet orange. Taste starts really balanced, malty, fruity with a touch of caramel. It gets bitter towards the finish making for an overall really balanced taste profile. Medium body with crisp carbonation. Quite tasty for the low ABV but also very drinkable.","  rDev On tap while going through Chicago. Clear dark amber with small off white head. Aroma is subdued due to very cold serving temps. Taste is nutty, caramel , toffee . No finish.","  rDev Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. Appearance- a crystal clear light copper color with a medium white head. Aroma- full of malt with some fruit in the background. Taste- a really good blend of caramel and malt with hops giving it a nice full flavor. Another really good offering from Goose Island.","  rDev I remember trying this beer for the first time – it was my first introduction into craft beer. I had no idea what I was getting into, and thought it was grotesque because it was so bitter. 7 years later I revisit this beer.   Appearance : Pours a honey cider colored body, 60% opaque. The head is creamy and large, measuring about 3 fingers, and leaving generous lace as it recedes down the glass. (4.25)  Aroma : Lots of biscuit malts, a dash of honey, and quite a bit of caramel sweetness. The hop aroma is actually pretty faint in this one, which is okay by me, but is piney in nature. There are some melon rinds and juicy tropical notes as well. Mostly caramel and honey and biscuit sweetness going on here. (4)  Taste : For a bitter this isn’t overpowering or offensive. The malts are very prominent here, yielding caramel, cracker, biscuit, and toasted grain. A pleasant hop bitterness shoves the malt forward, eventually making an appearance on the back end. (4)  Feel : The feel is divine. Rich and creamy, smooth, pleasantly carbonated, and easy to drink. It dries on the palate and invites another gulp. (4.5)  Overall : It’s hard to fault Goose Island’s Honker’s Ale for anything really. It’s a great bitter and has a fabulous malt backbone to compliment the resinous hop. I think it’s the best ESB I’ve had yet.

Man, it's been waaay too long since I last dove into some Sammy Smith goodness. Let's rectify that straight away, kids. This stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, pumpernickel, and a touch of orange pith embedded into the background. The taste brings in more of the same, a pinch or two of cocoa powder rounding things out. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit of bulky stout, one that doesn't throw its heft around, rather preferring to please throughout. Good times.","  rDev Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a two finger dark khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, graham crackers, molasses, raisin and cocoa. Flavor is dark toasted malt, dry caramel, baker's chocolate, dried dark fruit, dark molasses develops light grassy hop bitterness and finishes dry and a little earthy. Medium bodied with light creaminess. The Samuel Smith porters and stouts have a distinct flavor profile that incorporates fruit flavors that are almost concentrated. Great to revisit one of the classic Russian imperial stouts, one of the iconic products in brewing history. Great fruit notes and some of the most intense molasses characters I recall. The finish is a bit drier than I remember, but that's likely due to all the domestic RIS I've had, which have morphed from the original historical recipes. A delicious dark stout from a great brewery.","  rDev 355 mL bottle. Pours black with a medium khaki head. Smells of chocolate, a slight acidic twang, and some light grassy and earthy hops. Tastes of hops right up front with chocolate and roasted malt behind it. Creamy with a very light lactic tang. Finishes with hop bitterness. Medium body. Distinctive in flavor because of the creaminess and tang, but very drinkable and flavorful.","  rDev #1745 - Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)... L- Pours jet-black with a 5mm creamy looking fine-bubble dark tan head. S- Roasty-toasty with a certain brightness. [My sense of smell isn't clear today...]. T- Oh my, that's lovely. Well roasted, major cocoa facets and maybe a hint of very light smoke. F- Deep yet has some richness to balance. I also sense that despite it's not mad ABV (7%), that it is just about making it's presence visible to the palate. O- Very nice, nothing out of place or balance. Has a pungent flavour/feel yet sufficient richness (not sweetness, at all) to balance. Nice as a slow sippin' beer, but I could easily get stuck into a few of these too.  Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! Super elegant old-school lable. Ingredients include cane sugar, not that I noticed, surprising as I *detest* and usually spot sugar in beer! Would I buy this again? = Hell yes! 355ml bottle BBE: Jan-22, printed at neck. £2.25 Bought from TremblingMadness, York/UK as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London.","  rDev Big bready light tan head. Great production and very nice retention.  Nose features more dark fruit and bread than most thick American imperial stouts. Raisins, dates, toast, toffee, red grapes, tea, very light char, banana, and just hints of licorice and molasses.  Bitter and roasty on the palate; thin by the standards established by massive double digit stouts, but it's a full bodied stout nonetheless. Flavor moves through notes of toast, char, red grapes, nuts, raisins, prunes, licorice, toffee, banana, caramel. There's a bit of bite to the hops up front, and a bit of citrus peel on the finish.","  rDev 355ml from the olde country. A date(code?) on the neck smudged off  Very dark, mocha head. Smells like dry,herbal, medicinal hops, finishing choco roastie. A very tasty drink, with that familiar Sam Smith backing yeast (i think) taste. Better than the sum of its parts, the water malt yeast and hops combine to make a delectable chocolate malt dessert beer that drinks very easy. Slight alcohol spice on the end, creamy and well carbonated - this ain't syrupy or overly sweet  Another world-class banger","  rDev Pours a deep, dark brown coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of roasted, grainy malt, milk chocolate and lighter coffee and dark fruit aromas. Taste is a great balance of roasted, grainy malt, a strong chocolate and dark fruit presence, with notes of raisin, plum and fig, lighter coffee and hints of licorice and herbal, earthy hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate and dark fruits lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  While this appears a bit old school compared to modern RIS and perhaps just a tad lacking in body, it does have a rather nice dry and roasted character to it, with just a little sweetness coming through to round things out. Considering the ABV, there is a rather impressive depth of flavor and complexity to this as well, with a good overall balance.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours an almost pitch-black color with a one finger head of tan colored foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is massive of a nice molasses and caramel smell mixed with a rather strong showing of a roasted malt and a cola aroma. Along with these smells comes a big hit of a dark fruit smell of plum, raisin, and prune as well as a touch of a oaky smell. Overall, the aroma is delicious! Taste - The taste begins with a moderately roasted taste that contains a decent showing of a cocoa flavor as well as a touch of coffee. Right from the start there is a good sum of sweetness, with it being mostly of molasses and toffee nature, but containing some of the dark fruit that was detected in the nose. The roastiness gest slightly stronger as the taste moves forward, all while the darker fruit tastes fade. At the same time, some caramel and a touch of a char and a woody taste comes to the tongue. At the end of the taste, a tiny bit of a carob taste comes to the tongue as well as a touch of a booze, leaving one with a sweeter (but not overly sweet), and dark and very easy drinking taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is one the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is quite low. For the tastes and the style, the feel is fantastic and makes for a very easy, but slow sipping and tasty brew. Overall – A quite nice and approachable stout. While at only 7 % abv, I am not sure I would consider it an imperial stout, but categorization aside, this is a very tasty brew. Well crafted and balanced!","  rDev Bottle. Tan head with lace.

Pours opaque black with limited head and lacing.   Aromas of roasted malts and dark fruits waft in equal measure. Just a hint of booze.  The flavors are simple but solid. Roasted mats, dark sugars, dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and booze. Initially sweet, it transitions into an astringent flavor in midstream with an ashy boozy finish.  The feel is a bit flat and chalky--maybe the only drawback. Still not a heavy brew by any means.  But for a somewhat odd feel and finish, this would be a top tier representation of the style. As is, it's still impressive.","  rDev Pours jet black with a light cap of soft, tan head.  Smell is roasty with notes of coffee. figs. tobacco and fruity and meaty hints.  Taste is roasty and rich with notes of cofffee, leather, tobacco and hints of smoke and cured meat. Soft bitterness and a hint of wood on the finish.

Reviewed 7/29/19. After a diligent search, no date code was found on either the glass bottle or the label. Stored on shelf in store. Traveled in my ice chest, then refrigerated overnight in hotel refrigerator before being served in a hand washed and dried shaker.  Appearance – 4.25. First pour – Dark amber, clear. Body – Pitch black, opaque. Head – Large (Maximum nine cm, aggressive center pour), khaki, medium density, average retention, stabilizing at a three cm lacy crown and cap. After a rest, this slooowly continues retracting to an irregular seven to fifteen mm crown and a complete cap with small rocks. Multiple narrow tiny to medium bands of lacing remains as the head retracts. Lacing – Excellent! Irregular sheet of tiny to small bubbles, with an occasional medium one thrown in for variety. See also above. Aroma – 4 – A bit of brown sugar and a hint of molasses and that’s it. Flavor – 4.25 – somewhat malt-forward and very slightly bitter with a long hang time. Flavor is subdued. A slight gastric warming occurs. No alcohol taste or aroma (7 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.  Palate – 3 – Medium, almost creamy, soft carbonation. Impression and interpretation – 4 - (Lost 0.25 point for undated individual container.) Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this brew. It is indeed a kinder, gentler, RIS – so much so that I question if it should be classified as a RIS at all. I didn’t find the highly noticeable aroma or flavors typical of this style, at least typical of an American take on it. Perhaps it’s just too subtle for my crude colonial taste buds.","  rDev From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.   Black liquid; a hint of purple when held to the light.   Nice dark khaki head; strong lacing.   Plums &amp; booze in the nose.   Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel.   Dark fruit up front; chocolate undertones in the finish. Tastes like a Belgian stout to me!   Complex, unexpected &amp; tasty.","  rDev 500ml bottle in to a tulip snifter glass.  Tar black in color with a 2F-plus topping of mocha colored cream. A thick film ensues, lacing abounds.  Dark chocolate, cherry cola, toffee, semi-sweet, gentle alcohol. Roasted malt.  Lots of dark fruit, including cherry. There's licorice, chocolate, roasted malt with the slightest char.  The carbonation tingle and the 7% abv keep the body in check for a medium feel. there's a touch of sugar before a clean finish.  Made for winter evenings.","  rDev 12oz bottle coded SA13P1 (1/13/16) poured into a Samuel Smith tulip pint glass at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours dense black with tight mocha colored head. The head recedes to an eighth inch cap. The aroma is dark roasted malt, dark chocolate and a hint of cherry. The taste is semisweet chocolate and roast malt followed by a little tangyness and a lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a bit chalky and medium to full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, good. I purchased this at room temperature almost 2 years old, just a couple months ago. It's still good, but might have been a lot better.","  rDev It has been a long time since I had this classic beer. It will not be as long till the next time. Great beer!  Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Very dark brown with a light brown head and great lacing.

Medium light bitterness through the middle followed by bitter, lightly charred maltiness to the end. Finished dryly with light charred malt notes. Great look and a fabulous feel.

Great, dry finish with a mild aftertaste made only enhanced the drinkability.","  rDev Rich chocolate, light coffee. Toffee caramel. A touch of dark fruits","  rDev Glad to fill this gap in my beer tasting. Deserves to be near the top of RIS.  a) Pours black with ruby/amber edges supporting a thick head that lasts and laces.  s) Church like aroma of dark wood, shellac, beeswax, burning candles, incense, herbs, myrrh.  t) Follows the smell, something magical and ancient incense wafts along side the roasted core of black malt, balanced coffee sweetness, prunes, and a bit of balancing hops. Layered.  f) Fills the mouth with powerful flavor and leaves the mouth in a better place. A beautiful beer. Clean finish.  o) Beautiful beer that I'd like blind taste w friends vs other great RIS like Ten Fidy etc.","  rDev Medium body and a bit of a bite from the carbonation. Aroma is very light but mostly roasted malt and a little dried fruit. Taste came off all licorice at first but as it warmed the malt and the grain flavor showed up. Very well made but not my favorite from smith","  rDev By far one of the most mildest I-stouts I've ever had...  Kinda liked the packaging of the beer with the tin over the bottle cap and on the neck - I wish more did that, it does add an air of sophistication...Anyway, this was truly a solid beer. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but certainly solid. I enjoyed the blackness of the brew, the tan foam and the tiny bit of lacing provided. What was a tad disappointing was the smell - it was practically non-existent - there's nothing I could pull out, not even the boozy nature of such a style. Mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied, crisp, not tacky, all of it making for easy drinking. The taste was mostly roasted malts and even some stronger coffee undertones, but still, there just seemed to be something missing. In short, this is a good brew, one I would reach for again but not one I would go out of my way to seek.","  rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Samuel Smith nonic.   Clear seal brown body with a small tan cap, receding to a swirling surface slick and fine collar. Average retention - vague lacing.  Lovely roast malt aroma with hints of cocoa and coffee. The heavy fermentation in open stone squares does seem to impart a unique character with subtle fruity/floral esters if not a certain minerality as well.   Distinctive yeast driven flavor profile with a wave of malty complexity - toasted scones, scalded sugar, chocolate, and faint tobacco-like spiciness dry out the finish. Low bitterness, pleasant aftertaste.   Medium-bodied, almost creamy, soft mouth-feel with moderate carbonation.   A truly classic example of the style, free of the bombast of most American versions.","  rDev 0.355l bottle. Pours opaque black beer with strict 2-finger tan head.

There are definitely some little flakes of sediment floating around and there and settling into the bottom of the glass. Smell is nice, clear piny grassy hoppy notes and a definite malty/grain sweetness.  Taste is pretty much what a pale ale ought to be.

I can't believe I've never had one of these. No idea why.  Pours slightly hazed and light amber with moderate head, decent retention and spectacular lacing.  Well balanced caramel malt and earthy/grassy hop on the nose.  The brew hits the tip of the tongue with solid caramel malts, but they aren't overly sweet. Both fruity and earthy hops balance it well, but not aggressively so. Classic APA. Malts, but not too much. Hops, but with restraint. Flavor, but not in your face.  The brew could maybe use some more carbonation. It isn't heavy, but it is at least medium-bodied.  It is rare that a brew tastes and smells this good, but comes off this odd in the appearance and feel department. If it had one or two shades brighter color and just a bit more effervescence, this would be the paragon of the style. Still, even though it doesn't look or feel quite like an APA, the flavor is top notch.","  rDev Pours a foggy burnt orange with a finger of off-white foam. Head retention is good.

Flavor profile is herbal, floral, resiny citrusy and tropical fruity, with that order descending in order of presence. Biscuity and bready malts add base and balance.

Can conditioning adds to the overall full  FEEL  of this beer as well. Short finish. Great pale ale, true old school PA flavors.","  rDev On tap at the brewpub. Can’t believe I haven’t had this before. Looks and smells like an old school pale ale. Tasty and the finish is extraordinary. Finishes clean and malty and dry and crisp.","  rDev Very nice beer - had forgotten how good.  Pours a beautiful deep golden yellow color with a great head and lacing. Bready somwhat citrusy smell and taste. A bit of lemon with a slightly piney bitter finish. Very satisfying!","  rDev Appearance - Pours a light copper with two fingers of off-white head.  Smell - bready malts, caramel, earthy and leafy hops, and earthy yeast.   Taste - Bready malts and caramel followed by a punch from the earthy and leafy hops. The earthy yeast finishes the brew off.   Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes a tad sticky with the malts and hops lingering.  Overall - A sessionable and APA from Deschutes. The malts and hops are spot on and are nicely balanced.","  rDev Smooth creamy fruit aroma. Surprising for Cascade, but it reminds me of Deschutes’ fresh hopped beers that IMO come off soapy. This is quiet pleasant. Lighter bodied than Dale’s and I get an English ale ester vibe. I’d love to try this on cask.","  rDev ** 02/04/2018  Bottle to pilsner glass; while cooking for super bowl. Go Eagles.  LOOK: dark yellow, small off white head. Good color for a pale ale.  AROMA: biscuit, cereal, hints of floral and citrus notes. TASTE: sweet malted grains, light hops. light sour lemon/grapefruit like aftertaste. FEEL: full bodied for a pale ale. Carbonation gives it some real zing.  Very good version of a classic pale ale. Enjoying more as I get into it.  **","  rDev Clear orange body; thick, sculpted head. Light scents of light malt grains and subtle esters. The taste follows along with the aroma, a bit fruitier, plus some fine hop bitterness. Medium-heavy body; relatively slick on the tongue.  An old standby from Deschute's brewery. I haven't tried one in a long, long time, but this one is still a decent little brew. The hop presence isn't as intense as some other representations of this style, but the beer is well-balanced and quite drinkable.","  rDev From the left side of the front label:  BEST BY: 12/27/17 1349 11   Appearance: The beer has a golden brown body that is slightly hazy. It has a short off-white creamy textured head with moderate retention and lacing.  Aroma: There is a light herbal and flowery aroma.  Taste: There is a light touch of caramel flavor with a bread-like taste that follows. It has a light herbal hop flavor that has a bit of tea and mint character.  Mouthfeel: It is a very clean tasting beer that is refreshing. It has a medium-light body with a crisp wet finish touched by just a bit of hop bitterness.  Overall: It is a nice and enjoyable American Pale Ale that would fit in nicely at a cookout. I wish it were available in cans because it would be perfect for the beach or camping. I would drink it again and I would recommend grabbing a six-pack of it.","  rDev Deschutes Brewery  Mirror Pond Pale Ale  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle,  BEST BY: 11/22/17...  and sampled on 08/30/17 $2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: I've recently been chatting with friends about the use of caramel malt in beers, or rather, the excessive use of caramel malts in beers, and how quite often too much just ruins it. This is a great example of not doing that. There's just enough caramel malt that it's clear, and it gives it a fuller flavor without going overboard. It's not flabby, or excessively caramelish, and it doesn't hinder or drown out any of the other flavors (like the beautifully delicate Cascade hops in play here). Another thing I discussed was that I'm quite open to the use of caramel malts across the board. Mirror Pond is, in my opinion, a blend of both English and American styles. It's got floral and citrusy Cascade hops (American), but it's also got the caramelish maltiness of an English pale ale - and because they've balanced the malt and the hops properly it works remarkably well. A very firm bitterness balances it (it's labeled as 40 IBUs), and it finishes mainly dry with a swirl of hops and then some residual caramelish malt lingering. It doesn't have the fuller caramel malt content of an American amber ale, nor does it rely on just the golden, biscuity malt base that most American pale ales deliver - it's somewhere in between. And that's OK because when you balance a beer this perfectly it becomes incredibly drinkable and remarkably satisfying at the same time. It's so simple really, with just one variety of hop in play, but when you put it together right it becomes more than the sum of its parts. Really well done, and if you've had it before and didn't think much you should really give it another look.","  rDev Twelve ounce bottle copped from Pub 365 in Las Vegas. Pours a ruddy copper hue with minimal frothing. Mellow aroma replete with hints of hops and citrus. Sweet taste.","  rDev 12 oz bottle.

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an Upland Brewing pint glass.  A: Moderately hazy deep gold, with average visible carbonation and a finger of white head with poor retention.  S: Biscuit malts with a mild grainy character. Light grapefruit and grassy hops. Not particularly exciting.  T: Follows the nose. Citrus and grapefruit rind, grassy, plus a touch of resin. The biscuit malts are more prominent than expected in an APA. Lightly bitter in the hang.  M: Medium body, with average carbonation sensation and low alcohol presence.  O: I'm pretty disappointed – at best, this is an average, and quite possibly below average, modern American Pale Ale. Nothing offensive, but I won't be actively seeking it out again. It seems to be one of those beers that, while not terrible, I'd almost guarantee that you've got several better options sitting on the shelf around you...wherever you live.","  rDev Poured an almost copper body with minimal head and lace ring down glass. The aroma had some caramel malt in there but mostly a dirty, piney hop aroma. Smooth, dry hop taste that has balance to eat thanks to malty goodness and is real easy to drink."]},{"Name":"Gueuze 100% Lambic","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/388/1703/","Brewery":"Brasserie Cantillon","Style":"Lambic - Gueuze","Alcohol":5.00,"Score":99.0,"Comments":["  rDev Brasserie Cantillon 'Gueuze 100% Lambic @ 5.5% , served from a corked 750 ml bottle A-pour is gold from the bottle to a hazy gold in the glass with a quick dissipating off-white head leaving a streaky lacing along the chalice S-wheat , malted barley T-such a true sour beer , yet refreshing , thirst quenching , last pour getting all the goodness out the bottle is so tart MF-somewhat mild carbonation , medium body , not a warming beer Ov-this beer makes you wanna go pee prost LampertLand","  rDev Look - slight hazy copper yellow with a nice rimming and lacing Smell - Tart scent with some pear and citrus Taste - possibly some tart pear with with citrus like the scent Feel - Dry with a slight carb Ovearll - Pretty great classic tart lambic","  rDev 375 ml bottle.

Strong aromas of barnyard funk, white wine vinegar, pears, stone fruit and citrus zest. Lighter notes of oak, grass, green apple, and vanilla.   The taste has a lot of white wine grape and pears, as well as green apple, apricot, lemon, yeast and lime zest. There's also plenty of oak and vanilla. Subtly grassy and tannic.

The pour is lightly fizzy, deep orange with a wisp of a white head.   Smells wonderfully like a cross between a clean-but-musty garden shed and heaps of jarred fruit, like something tended to with such intense care that it makes you warm to so much as think about it. Incredibly complex, like a living being, without anything off or too intense. Seriously one of the very best beer aromas I've come across in my 16+ years of reviewing beer.  The flavor is wonderful but not quite at the level of the aroma. Very dry and earthy yeast and bacteria start things off, not tart in the least but with the same kind of quenching bitterness I associate with the finish of a very sour candy. This dominates the first sip, but after my pallet adjusts I detect excellent fruit complexities near the middle, smoothed out wonderfully by woody tannins, finishing on the aforementioned deep dryness of ash and microbes.","  rDev Bottled with a cap and a cork  I don’t care if it’s the wrong glass, fill it up.

This beer literally glows.  The nose is tart and funky, with white grape and barely ripe Granny Smith apple aromas. Wow. I believe this is gonna be a “puckerer” of a Gueuze.  There is some pucker on the taste, but not nearly as much as I thought would be present. I get the white grape and green apple flavors, and it is indeed very tart and funky, but there’s a tannin-like quality to this - it’s very acidic, almost like champagne (without all the bubbly), and there’s a little salt as well.  The mouthfeel is very dry, which I expected. What I did not expect is the aftertaste - this tastes like a beer in the way back of my palate. Magnificent.  This is my first Cantillon, and I see what all the hype is about. Truly world-class, IMHO.","  rDev Look: Gold, translucent and a little cloudy. A bone white head that almost entirely disappears but for a thick round around the edge of the glass. A lot of visible carbonation.   Smell: Fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice, juicy Granny Smith apple, some white vinegar, Green/white tart strawberry. Rotting lime. You know the aroma of the skin when they start to turn brown? There’s a sweeter, cinnamony oak note too.   Taste: The taste is pretty good but leave some wanting more. The acidity is medium with notes of lemon juice and white vinegar. There’s a good amount of bitterness. Tart and bitter domaine the flavors. Some earthy herbal and nutty notes.   Feel: light bodied and effervescent. Dry.   Taste: As expected flavor profile. Pleasant enough but not one of the more memorable Gueuze experiences that I’ve had.","  rDev The beer pours a lightly foamy and white head that takes a bit to dissipate but seems carbonated enough that the glass I poured it in is creating a constant flow of carbonation to the top; keeping the surface covered with a nice looking foamy head. The beer itself is a clear solid medium gold color with a nice metallic appearance to it. I have ever rarely seen a more gorgeous beer every poured.  The smell is pretty good. It starts with an herbal and orange rind and slowly reveals a slightly vinegar note at the end.  The taste is absolutely fantastic. The notes are not overpowering but not hidden either. Rather, they come out fairly balanced with varying degrees of subtlety. It has a decent funk note with a hint of vinegar and bitter herbal orange rind with a slightly wood finish.  The feel is divine. It is only slightly acidic but is not such that it is overwhelming. It has a very smooth feel with a good body to it; it is neither thin nor thick but directly in between.  Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Cantillon earns its reputation as very good brewery and this beer is perfect for hotter days during the summer or early Fall when things are getting cold but it's still hot.","  rDev Finishing out one of the best weeks of my recent life, right in the middle of this virus stuff. I needed to finish it right. I bought this at a bottle shop in Paris in 2014 that is no longer open. It was in my beer refrigerator since then.   Love this beer fresh and funky despite its age - you can almost feel the evening Belgian breeze.  Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Cloudy yellow. Herbal, floral funk smell and taste. Slightly sour but fruity and refreshing. Strawberries, lime, leather, oak.   I hope to have more someday when this virus mess is over!","  rDev This 2013 bottle was cellared and cool for many years.  The initial pour is optically clear and amber. (Later pours got cloudy). There is little visible carbonation.  The aroma is tart and vinous.  The flavor is very full. It is tart, but not sour. It is quite cider-like. There are green apple and grape notes. There are woody and slightly funky aspects.  The finish is somewhat dry.  This is special.","  rDev Had Gueuze Cantillon poured from capped-and-corked 37,5cl bottle, bottled  06 DECEMBER 2008,  personally imported from Paris for me in Summer 2019 by my daughter, into Teku tulip 3.0.   This late 2018 bottle pours peach-gold, almost orange. Nice near-white head is soon gone without a trace. The big sour and fruity aroma soon settles into persistent horse blanket. After a surprisingly mild start, wheat spice makes a brief appearance, before the funk and sharp but not terribly tart fruit--peach and persimmon--arrive and carry the beer to its very dry finish.","  rDev Pours a lightly hazy amber with a rose gold hint around the edges.  Smell has lactic tartness over a rich sweet breadiness, oaky and kinda funky. Light hints of light stonefruit like peach or apricot.  Taste is divine, a nice complex tartness that isn't puckering married with some woody funky bits.  Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Leaves you ready for another  Overall it's not hard to understand why this is held up as the standard bearer for the style. A truly world class display of depth and balance. Tart and funky and lightly sweet. Everything super delicate and well put together. Different flavors show themselves as it warms a bit but each iteration is a joy.","  rDev 2017 vintage enjoyed in the first days of 2019 Slightly hazy pale yellow with a very thin head.  Some funk on the nose but quite clear compared to other gueuzes. The taste is sour with mostly lactic notes and no acetic notes. Funky bretts, the raw wheat is very present and quite smooth.  Quite dry and with a champagne-like carbonation.  A unique Gueuze. Refined compared to other examples. Had it a lot of times after that both on tap and in bottle. What strikes me the most is the balance of the beer. Have it fresh you've got a perfectly refreshing drink. Have it a room temperature and you've got a wonderfully complex offering.","  rDev Bottled 16 June 2017: Pours clear gold color with a 2+ finger white foamy head that seemed like a cloud on top of the brew, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing, most of which slides down quickly.  Smells of barnyard funk, wet grass, a muddy trail and then honey, toasted grains, fruit notes like peach, lemon zest and a very acidic juice like grapefruit juice or sour orange juice. Complex for sure, but everything is muted and even with the funk, fruit and earthy notes interchanging with each whiff. I get floral notes as well after a few minutes.  Tastes of tart fruit like sour white grapes, green apple, lemon zest, red grapefruit, orange peel and then comes funk and what could be brett, along with yeast, dry flowers, peppery spices, rose pedals, honey, wet cardboard or musty bread, some more trailing funk like the smell of wet animal hair and then a dry trailing fruity aspect. It's very complicated and bounces between tart and funky, but the malty base brings sweet grainy notes it that cuts the sourness and allows more fruity flavors to come through. Hard to put my finger on everything that I taste as it's mostly what's listed above with flavors that resemble ginger ale and white wine. Very easy to drink considering the tartness at points. This is a style I need to explore more to build up my appreciation.","  rDev Had this on tap at Seymour in Greenfield. The beer had a bright, orange-yellow appearance with a thin head. The beer had a mixture of aromas of cherries, white wine, grapes that was wonderfully balanced. The taste had those aromas but it included an apple tartness. Very well carbonated and crisp. Overall, an excellent beer, especially with its aromas and flavors.","  rDev just drank Cantillon Gueuze 100% Lambik (classic) from Brasserie Cantillon, ABV 5.00%, the one in the picture. It is one of the best Gueuze I've ever had. It was a truly pleasant taste experience.  Look: hazy light golden with a thick fluffy white head  Aroma: citrus, some brett yeast, white wine  Taste: fruity and tart, lemon, apricot maybe, orange, green grapes, white wine, oak barrel, a little bit of brett funk, slight lasting bitterness. It is not too tart, just really pleasant drinking with a complex interesting flavor.  Feel: light body, easy drinking","  rDev Pours a clear golden amber coloration with a tiny, fizzy head that soon fades to nothing. Smell is dominated by musty, blue cheese funk and fruity and tart esters of white grape and gooseberry and oaky, tannic accents, with a hint of a certain sweetness coming through as well. Taste is a great balance of tart and fruity esters of white grape, and gooseberry, strong funkiness with a musty, blue cheese character and a sharp lactic acidity, which lends a certain citrus bite to this, with lighter notes of oaky tannins and just a hint of white vinegar as well. Finishes with a medium/strong acidity and some funk and oaky tannins lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and light/medium carbonation.  A great Geuze that has got quite a funky and very sour and acidic character to it, but also features a certain sweetness as well as fruity undertones and some distinct oaky, tannic accents. I know a lot of people like that extreme sourness, but for me personally it is a little too strong here, although not exactly overpowering or overly vinegary by any means. This is still quite complex and nicely balanced, with the oaky tannins adding an especially pleasing depth here, but I prefer a little bit more subtleness to this style, while I'm also not a huge fan of the accentuated sweetness and light to medium vinegar notes, while I also think that the mouthfeel is just a little flat. All in all a great Geuze that is quite bold in its sour and funky expression, but I personally prefer the more subtle balance of 3Fonteinen.","  rDev I have been scouring through my backlog, including some (mostly) bottles in my Beerfrigerator, an all-reefer with no freezer space.

The nose hit us all. Man, when they talk about a  barnyard funkiness , this is the phrase's poster child! Cheesy, sour, sweaty, funky, wow! I remember being off-put the first time that I tried Gueuze for this very reason, but now, I have come to embrace it. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not watery, but not terribly beyond it, either. That said, it was mighty carbonated, creating a pleasant effervescence in the mouth and on the tongue. The extensive aging had mellowed it from distinctly sour to a tickle in the hinges of my jaw, but the tartness was still as puckering as ever. The taste was musty and cheesy with a pronounced lemony sourness. I let it just kind of roll around in my mouth to allow the taste &amp; smell to permeate my sinuses so as to create a pleasant memory. Finish was super dry, puckeringly tart &amp; just what I expected from this gem.

Has a distinct toasted malt flavor with some underlying fruity esters (strawberry, lemon, orange) with a nip of pine on the finish.

The aroma is a bit stankier than yer garden variety lager. It pushes the envelope with finishing hops.

Some brief deeper conifer/fruits, but a fresh nose T- Quite dry, 'pale-ale'ish', into yet hoppier dry end. There is a brief flavoursome middle, but I can't put my finger on the fleeting flavour notes there. M- Distinctly dry and hoppy, especially for a lager. In a blind tasting I would have put money on this being a pale ale, albeit not a sledge-hammer example, perhaps a summer pale ale. O- I've drunk this several times on/off over the years, but this is the first time I've sat down and thought about it via the prism of rating it. Very nice. Checking now and seeing it's 5.2% makes sense as it feels that way. Strikingly hoppier/dryer than your typical lager. Would happily enjoy this again.","  rDev -clear amber can pour with 1cm of fluff and a light, hay-like aroma. The flavor is malt first, with a bit of spice from the hops, following.

Has a very refreshing, well carbonated lighter to medium body.  Tastes of whole grain bread, sweet toffee and a surprisingly dry, herbal hop appearance. Turns a little sweeter then with caramel and dried oranges among an uprising lemon bitterness. Finishes with more bready, toffee malts and a zingy hop bitterness, which coats the tongue surprisingly long.  A great tasting hybrid between a classic lager and an american pale ale.

I would drink this if it was local for me.","  rDev Review 1505  The last New Glarus beer I have to consume, a sad day. This beer is another one that has been on my radar to try for a while now. The beer is 42 degrees and served in a tulip glass. I am going to warm this beer up just a touch more before consuming it. The beer emits a nice hiss as I popped the top. The pour of the beer created a lovely two-fingered head with average retention. The bright white head is creamy and airy leaving some lacing as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale gold with amber hues. The beer is clear with some carbonation bubble dancing lazily within. I would have liked to see a longer-lasting head. Overall the appearance of the beer is an average plus.   Initial aromas in the beer are straw, lightly toasted malts, and subtle sour lemons. Nosing further I detect, earthiness, floral, salty air, lightly toasted bread crust, and a touch of herbal. Interestingly, I do not get any funky aromas but just the faint whiff of sourness.   The flavors in the beer are grass, cereal grains, lightly toasted malts, lemons, a touch of herbal, and a smidge of floral esters.  The mouthfeel of the beer is creamy, smooth, and crisp.   The body of the beer is medium-light, medium carbonation, and light finish.   I would not consider this beer a farmhouse ale it taste like a cream ale with a hint of hops. The beer is crushable and I would drink several if I could, but I do not think it is worth the hype. I am glad I was able to consume it and will try to get it again.","  rDev 12oz can served in a nonic glass. Date stamp of A3111616 on the bottom of the can.  Appearance: Golden yellow with a bit of haze. Big thick white head that died back slowly to a persistent skin across the top. Plenty of thick sheets of lacing.   Smell: Clean, a tiny bit of corn, a little yeasty with some clove and banana notes, and wee bit of floral hops. It's quite subtle.   Taste: Malt, banana/yeast notes, fruity esters, a tiny bit of cooked grains and a very mild finish.   Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, nice thickness, dry finish.   Overall / Drinkability: Hits the style pretty well, and is a simple but well crafted beer. Easily drinkable and went well with Salisbury steak.","  rDev Bottle reads 'K100'  Pours a lightly fogged lemon gold body topped with a finger and a half of rocky, soapy white foam; good head retention leaves a light veil of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and an array of firm, spotty lacing around the glass.  Aroma begins rustic and grainy, with touches of malty/corny grit lightly contrasting waves of perfectly-balanced, grassy cream notes; banana and clove are further accentuated in a bouquet enmeshed in underlying creaminess, and peppery, bready malts spark a mild contrast over the middle; hints of baked apple and pear skins develop quietly on the back end and through the close.  Taste opens with semi-sweet cereal grain before picking up a more moderated creamy texture against some grassy, light lemon over the mid-palate; pear appears on the back end as more grassy, fleeting cream tones fade into the finish.  Mouthfeel features a light body alongside a robust, full carbonation; a delicate 'snap' over the mid-palate parallels an underlying creaminess across the palate, belying what becomes a crisp, perfectly dry conclusion.  A rustic cream ale, an outlier in the style as refreshing and unique as it is a pure sample of its greatest qualities; consistent, flavorful, quenching, comprehensive; a pinnacle in sessionable ale, a gold standard for the style.","  rDev Can courtesy of BigTimeADL.

Yep!","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of funky yeast, bready malt, lemon and piney hops. Body is full and crisp. Piney hops, funky yeast, wheat malt and citrus fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Nice brew.","  rDev From the bottle of indeterminate age, it pours a hazy golden amber with a nice white head. In the nose, it is light and pleasant malt. In the mouth, it is smooth with a nice light citrus accent and smooth malt base. Nice!","  rDev Had at New Glarus Hotel Restaurant on draft into pint tumbler.  The local popularity of this Cream Ale is understandable. Hoppy enough to start, then creamy and sweet and a bit fruity, but then the hops return to clean it up for the next gulp.","  rDev Pours an unfiltered orange with just a bit of head   Smells of honey and fresh orange peel  Interesting taste with distinct progression. First I get honey, then a bit of lemon, and it finishes with a nice breadlines.  Lightly carbonated, creamy mouthfeel, nice sweet finish, almost like a Belgian ale","  rDev This should certainly not be listed as a cream ale... It is far more saison/farmhouse in nature...  Poured from a can into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a hazy orange amber color with a small white head of fizzy foam. The head fades very fast to leave just trace of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is very bready and yeasty with a little orange and some harvest fruits. Along with these aromas comes some notes of hay and grass as well as a decent showing of coriander and clove. Taste – The taste begins as one may expect from the nose with a rather wheat bready taste that has a strong showing of orange and yeast. Upfront there is also some spice tastes of coriander and clove, with both of these growing stronger as the taste moves forward. Along with the spice increasing in taste, so too does some flavors of hay and grass. All the while, the sweetness of the brew seems to increase as well with fruit flavors of orange and banana, as well as some light candied sugar tastes coming to the tongue. With the sweet, bread, grass, and spice flavors one is left with a very robust and enjoyable Belgium style farmhouse taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – the body of the brew is a bit on the thicker and chewier side for a beer of its abv. and style with a carbonation level that is a tad low. The feel was fantastic for the slightly sweeter and bready tastes of the brew and accentuates the chewy flavors of the beer quite nicely. Overall – This is a fine example of the slightly sweeter farmhouse style ale. It has a great body, nice yeasty and spicy hit, all while keeping a sweet and drinkable feel. Overall rather well done.","  rDev Pours a golden yellow color with a foamy white head that lasts quite a while. No discernable aroma. Taste is mildly sweet. Mild sweetness.

From the CAN:  Employee Owned ;  Only In Wisconsin ;  Drink Indigenous ;  Cask conditioned ale has been the popular choice among brews since before prohibition. We continue this pioneer spirit with our Wisconsin farmhouse ale. Brewed with flaked barley and the finest Wisconsin malts. We even give a nod to our famers. Naturally cloudy, we allow the yeast to remain in the bottle [?] to enhance fullness of flavors which cannot be duplicated otherwise. Expect this ale to be fun, fruity and satisfying.

The Crack! was nice &amp; loud &amp; I just could not CANstrain myself from an inverted Glug! This led to the quickfast formation of two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose had an oddly surprising vanilla &amp; corn sweetness to it, kind of like a vanilla milkshake, but the corn was also quite evident. Ah, sweet corn, especially in the summer. Mouthfeel was medium, but oh, so smooth! Miss MooCow is having an effect on me. The taste was quite sweet, more towards corn than vanilla, but still evocative of vanilla ice cream. It was sweeter &amp; less sharp than Genny Cream Ale, which I CANsider to be the standard bearer of the style, but it was very pleasant. Easy drinking? Try crushable! This seemed to simply evaporate from my glass. Finish was sweet, but not sugary or cloying. This could easily be a lawnmower beer or the one to take to The Dells for an outing on the WI River. They have duck boats there! I CANnot wait to relocate to the Midwest.","  rDev Pours a clouded golden color with a small, stable white head.  Smells of wet grass and a note of wet basement among rich straw. The beer remains a little subdued on the nose.  Has a very lively carbonation with a stony mineralic presence, together with a light body.   Tastes truly refreshing from the very beginning with white bread dough, a note of lemon zest, corn and soft, spicy yeast. Turns a little spicier during mid palate with a more pronounced mineralic presence and rich wheat. Finishes creamier with a mellow breadiness and slightly sweet toffee.  Has a simple, rustic character, like a saison dupont light version plus a nice, light note of lime. It does have a nice, smooth mouthfeel, but lacks a little in flavor intensity.","  rDev Appearance - Pours with a hint of haze, golden yellow in color with a white, two-finger width head. Good retention results in a thin, consistent layer of suds across the surface. Fair lacing, with some broken lines and a a handful of small spots.  Smell - Sweet, malty aroma. Soft, fruity esters. Faint, faint hop character... maybe some grass or earth?  Taste - Follows the nose. Mild sweetness. Moderate fruit pokes through mid-taste, hinting at apple sweetness and pineapple acidity in character. Finish hints at some grain and earthy hop undertones.  Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with soft, bubbly carbonation. Velvety smoothness with a clean, easy finish.  Overall - Good session-type beer with just enough flavor while the body is smooth and quite quaffable.

The yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.  Because Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley.","  rDev Uncaged and uncorked this pour produces an exceptional foamy white head on top of an opaque dirty lemon yellow body.

Damnation  375 ml. brown glass bottle, corked &amp; caged,  BOTTLED ON: 041516  $6.99 @ Weis Market #233, Norristown, PA  Notes via stream of consciousness: I've carefully poured this to leave the lees behind and what I ended up with was a hazy kind of brass-gold body beneath a massive head of pillowy white foam. Thousands of tiny bubbles can bee seen racing upwards. It would have surely come out clearer if I'd had a larger bottle; it's a little harder to decant the smaller bottles. The aroma expresses malt, yeasty spiciness, earthiness like a damp stone wall and dirt floor in a basement, and mild banana. It's also a touch floral. The flavor follows. If you thought that perhaps because of the name this was a Duvel clone you were wrong, this is much more complex. The malt is grainy and straw-like, and just lightly sweet, although there is a mild bit of  rock candy  character to the beer as well. The earthy and spicy components are firm, coming from both yeast and hops, and appear from start to finish. I might even call it  woody . As it lingers in the finish there's more leafy/earthy hop than it started with, and a little less  spiciness , but then that  spiciness  also becomes a little more like black pepper as well, which is curious. Even the leafy/earthy hops become a little bit more herbal. Perhaps the drying effect of the alcohol has something to do with it? It's firmly bitter but the bitterness never really stands out, it's just there within the malt until you get to the dry finish, and then it's really that peppery spice that's there. There's a fruitiness to it that goes beyond banana but I'm not sure what it is. There's a very slight bit of acidity to it and that makes me think of something like berries and apricot, maybe some peach. I'm also finding apple, and a touch of pear, maybe just a little bit. Looking back I find that it's left some impressive lacing, and that there's still a somewhat solid surface covering - there are whispy spots that are thin, and thicker areas that look like islands. It's medium leaning towards medium-light in body and gently effervescent. Apart from the dryness in the finish the alcohol never shows, and it's really quite drinkable. It's a sipper, but you're continually pulled back to take another sip, going from sweet to dry, sweet to dry, sweet to dry, until it's gone.","  rDev Hazy golden blonde with film. 4 Hay, flowers, wax, and lemon. 4.25 Thread of wheat, lemon verbena, grass, spice, some fruity waxberry, and pear with a rindy finish. 4.25 Creamy, round, medium. 4  Wild flower honey!

Poured out of a 12.88 oz. corked bottle into one of my tulip glasses, this beer pours a slightly cloudy/hazy, but mostly clear, light to medium, bright golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface. Had a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles to a solid 2/3 inch thick with very good retention. Has good lacing here too. Aromas of pale Belgian malts and yeast, including some Brett, along with some apricot, clove, nutmeg, pear, and a hint of pineapple. Also a bit of Belgian candy sugars. The taste is very similar, with fairly sweet, pale Belgian malt and somewhat grainy flavor upfront that gives way to the aforementioned yeast flavors. This is followed by a hint of banana and clove, nutmeg, and a touch of peppercorn that's followed by pear, and pineapple that give this just the slightest tart hint. All of this is then rounded out with a bit more sweetness courtesy of the aforementioned Belgian candy sugars. There is a slight bitterness too. Has a mainly crisp, slightly prickly and gritty, yet smooth and frothy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Another truly excellent beer from Russian River. I hope I have the opportunity to drink this again.  Eric","  rDev 2016-12-23 375ml corked/caged bottle split between a pair of snifters. I poured mine second, and I got a bunch of dregs. Bottled on 06/10/16.  The 1st pour was clear and golden; both have a nice, big, fluffy white head and a lot of active carbonation. Smell is yeasty/funky, maybe a hint of clove, grass, spice.  Taste is bready with a very funky bitter, lots of biscuit and grass flavor. I was expecting a little banana, but there's not much there unless I really look for it.  Mouthfeel is light and fluffy. Overall, very good Belgian Strong Pale.","  rDev Has a clean golden color, 1/2  white head. Aroma drops the light skinned fruits and citrus is a mild way.  Taste is a well hopped belgian pale, more of that light skinned fruit stuff, mild bitterness, dry pale malt base. This is probably my favorite example of this style of beer. Funny it isn't appreciated more.","  rDev A bottle with a bottled on date of 4.15.16  L - Blonde and cloudy, with 2 fingers of head, and lots of lace left on top of the brew. Gorgeous beer!

Light sweetness, and just a hint of lemon zest bitterness.  Medium, syrupy body, moderate, soft carbonation.   Got at Russian River a few days ago, drank Sept 19th, 2016 in Redding, CA. Really well done, soft, well rounded Belgian Strong Pale Ale. No rough or unpalatable qualities, making it very smooth to drink.","  rDev Hazy pale gold with two finger of thick and lasting white head with heavy lacing. Banana, Belgian yeast and pepper in the nose, leaves a fairly dry impression. Tastes similar with some clove and herbal notes.

This is not a classic craft beer by any standard but as a summertime thirst quencher - it fits the bill!!!! Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Has a medium size foamy white head with good retention and a little filmy lacing on the glass. Hazy grapefruit color. Aroma and taste are 'lemon drop candy  and a very slight wheat bitterness. Nothing complicated, but pleasant enough!!! Mouthfeel is crisp and tart, not too light - just right for belting down a few on a hot day.","  rDev Not one of my favorites in the summer beer category. Smells and tastes a bit like a rest area off of I-10 in Texas. Probably tastes a little better than that. But not much.","  rDev (24 oz can, NOV0419; purchased cold... poured into 28 oz mug)  L: incredibly cloudy (like NEIPA), golden-amber liquid; puts up a tall mat of frothy foam which starts to crumble immediately, but a cap does hold for awhile; thick ring of lace at the top  S: much lemonade at the fore but, surprisingly, the underlying aromatics of the wheat are very much in the mix... interesting balance, wasn't expecting that - I must say it is an inviting scent... with each burp, the lemon won't quit  T: lemon(-lime) soda pop up front, with the weissbier swelling up in the finish; the aftertaste shifts back to the lemon drink, with some fruity yeast and a muffin-like malt note hanging in the back... after the first sip, the weissbier, which is relatively full-flavored, barmy, and overall rather tasty, begins to assert itself more, start to finish... as I said above, the more you burp, the more the lemon creeps back  F: healthy degree of stealth carbonation, short of spritzy; its body is on-point for a wheat beer (hefe or wit), light-medium and frothy, bouncy up front, mellow cottony/cushion-y residual film...   O: I have had this once or twice, swilling from the bottle - drinking it from a glass definitely allows the flavors to open up more... I'd never noticed this had a weissbier and not a lager as its base... can't deny it, this is pretty flavorful and enjoyable; wouldn't avoid it outright (1450)","  rDev 473 mL can from the LCBO; dated Feb 1 2019 and served slightly chilled. Labelled  Lemon Shandy  for the Canadian market, and more than likely brewed at one of the M-C plants on this side of the border.  Pours a foggy, translucent, pale golden-yellow colour, initially capped with nearly two fingers of foamy, soapy white head. Within several minutes, it has been reduced to a creamy-looking collar and a thin, filmy cap; a decent coat of messy lace develops after a few sips. The nose is straight-up lemonade and sugar, with only the barest semblance of grainy, wheaty malt sweetness being discernible underneath the citrusy, lemony bulk of the aroma. Inoffensive, and lacking that off-putting dish soap aspect that some lemon beers suffer from, but it's not exactly setting up high hopes.  It's ok - that's the best compliment I can muster. It tastes mostly of lemonade soda, backed by a subtle note of wheaty, grainy malt sweetness that is actually most noticeable in the aftertaste, after the lemon has faded. Suggestions of lemon peel towards the finish, but that's about all I can come up with to describe this one's flavour profile. Light body with good carbonation levels that give it a crisp, satisfying bite; exactly what I want from this sort of beer. Bonus points for its sessionability and refreshing nature.  Final Grade: 3.26, a C+. Leinenkugel's Lemon Shandy is just tolerable enough to adequately perform its function, i.e. quench thirst in hot weather. It's the sort of not-quite-beer that would be fine to drink at a baseball game with limited beverage options, or perhaps after mowing the lawn on a hot day. Hell, just this past summer (when it first showed up here in Ontario), I tossed a can in my backpack and enjoyed it on a hike. I'd never refuse this if it were handed to me, but there are too many other radlers (and, to a lesser extent, shandies) out there these days to settle for this mass-produced mediocrity.","  rDev On draught at Gaslight Social Club.   Pours a hazy yellow, small head of foam.   I get notes of lemon, wheat, bread. All on the light side.   Tastes like it smells. Inoffensive light flavours, simple, refreshing.   Light body with medium carbonation.   It is what it is. I miss the Sunset Wheat.","  rDev Hard to believe I haven't had this before. This is a straightforward and solid shandy. Nice bright lemon flavors with a decent malt backbone. It's a great summer beer.","  rDev Can- pours a hazy pale straw with a puffy 2 finger cap...aroma is subtle- biscuit dough and lemon with some grassy spiciness. Flavor is mild, rounded, bready with a lemon kiss and a creaminess in the mouth feel, fast crisp finish, a decent thirst buster...I never liked these things (My dad had to make shandys for my Mom in the summer heat because she thought beer was  fattening )...always thought they were fruity, weak ladies drinks...but I found myself liking this one as I literally slammed it after a hot day of yard work.","  rDev Pours a light hazy golden color. 1 finger white head with decent retention.  The nose has a lemon aroma to it. Taste A light slight lemon flavor. Slight sweet. Body is light, and slightly watery.  For a shady, on a hot summer day, it's delicious.","  rDev Not the best shandy, but not the worst.","  rDev Hazy honey gold, substantial head, good lace. Big whiff of faux lemon up front. Super mild, not a big flavour profile. Faux lemon again, almost medicinal to drink. Passable as a summer cooler. Very soft stuff.","  rDev An aroma of grain and lemon juice. Tasted like beer meets lemon soda. There was lemon,a bit of malt and lemon tart and bitterness. It's far from world class but for something different at a bbq or picnic it can work","  rDev BA reviews strike me as harsh on this simple Summer Shandy that is merely doing its job of being refreshing. Context is key. If you review this as what we know as  beer , its poor ratings can be justified. But if we review it as a beverage with a simple job, then Summer Shandy is pleasant and pleasurable. I had it with a spicy lunch (that needed some lemon juice) on a nice summer day. This beer made me happy. And as Garrison Keillor has made famous for Minnesotans  That is good enough.  (Leinie's is brewed near the Minnesota border.)  As for my review... I agree, Summer Shandy Looks like not much. And it Smells only a little better (lemons open up the nose for this beer's biggest plus.) To me, it Tastes fine. Lemons and wheat are a great summer combination that too many brewers shy from for fear, I suppose, of being accused of making sissy-beer. Feel? Mostly refreshing, cleansing the palate for more spicy food. Overall ? This beer made my lunch far more interesting than I expected.","  rDev 12 oz bottle  hazy bright yellow in color, foamy white head. sweet and tart lemon heavy aroma. taste is as expected - like a lemonade beer. easy drinking and refreshing.","  rDev 12 oz bottle BB 6/2/17 poured into a can glass at fridge temp 4.2% ABV. The beer is the color of pineapple juice and very hazy. The head is white and short lived with only a thin ring left around the glass after a few minutes. The aroma is very faint of lemon. The taste is wheat malt and the hint of lemon. Mouthfeel is full and soft with sharp carbonation and a hint of the filmy aftercoating you get in cheap AAL. Overall, ok for its intended duty, but not for me.","  rDev Look--Hazy gold to yellow. Good head and lacing.  Aroma--Pleasant crisp citrus aroma.  Taste--Similar to the aroma--good crisp flavor that works well on a hot day. But a little heavy-handed with the lemon, even for a shandy.  Feel--The best part of the brew. Very crisp and refreshing.  Overall--A good beer on a hot day for a  one-off  but that's about it. Too much artificial lemon.","  rDev This beer pours a hazy straw with a medium sized fluffy head. The aroma is of bright lemon oil, some lemon juice, and a refreshing wheat quality. The flavor is simple and refreshing, dominated by the lemon with nice notes from the underlying wheat. The mouthfeel is light and fizzy. While I have had this Midwestern classic before, this is my first time thinking about and reviewing it. It is reasonably good and refreshing on a hot day. I see why it is such a blockbuster seller.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass No bottling dates   A: Murky to the point of being opaque, very light pale yellow, large white head, minimal lacing. 3  S: Huge lemon, some wheat characters, decent amount of sweetness. Not much else, but I like it quite a bit. Like a wheaty lemonade. 4  T: Like the nose it's predominately lemon, fairly tart and some sugary lemonade sweetness. Sweet wheat to round it out. 3.5  M/D: Medium body, carbonation appropriate, very good drinkability although it's rather filling. 3.75  O: I know this beer gets crushed on BA but I actually like it for what it is, and find that's it's a nice refreshing drink on a hot SC summer day. 3.75","  rDev Treacle. Dislike flavored, sweetened coffees as much as most flavored beers. If I want lemon or lemonade or any other kind of fruit essence or juice in my beer - why would I not add it myself?!?!?!","  rDev Light lemony yellow color with short lived white cap.  Light aroma that reminds me of peach/apricots. I know it's lemon (brewer says so) but I get peach blossoms.  Tastes like a simple wheat beer sweetened with honey and spiked with lemon slices. I say honey because the brewer says honey is used but this brew isn't particularly sweet, nor is it particularly tart which one expects from lemon. Perhaps the honey is used to offset the lemon but the combination is a good one here keeping everything in balance.  Texture is light and sprightly.  I think I get a hint of mild hop flavor in the aftertaste but all the rest is honey lemon. Sounds icky but this brew is very well balanced.","  rDev Im not doing a full category by category review of this. Heres the deal. Is it refreshing? hell yea. Is it sweet? hell yea. Is it closer to Mike's Hard than a beer? Yea kinda. But it is a refreshing drink for a hot day and is what it is which is a weird style of beer and not great at that."]},{"Name":"Temptation","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/9474/","Brewery":"Russian River Brewing Company","Style":"Wild Ale","Alcohol":7.50,"Score":98.0,"Comments":["  rDev A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99.

I’m too excited so let’s just get into it  Pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  Oh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper  The funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish.

Wow!","  rDev Golden color, nicely hazy, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is green grape, lemon, oak, and da funky Brett.  The taste is very refined, with the green grape and funky Brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate, with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious.   The mouthfeel is bright and fizzy, per the style. An excellent wild ale, IMHO.","  rDev Mostly clear gold, violent effervescence, with a massive, rocky white head that leaves webbed lacing.  Distant chardonnay, just a little tartness, a hint of funk and some wood in the nose.  Great white wine sweetness first upon sipping gives away immediately to some sharp brett coupled by some great funk and wood. It’s a funky-ass beer.  Light bodied and almost pillowy feeling.  To my preference, I’d love if the fruity wine character could hold its ground against the brett just a little longer — but this is still an excellent concoction.","  rDev Golden pout with a sweet scent of grapeseed and melon. Flavors were fruity with a slight vinegar-like tartness that was actually more gentle then what the initial taste inferred. Very drinkable. A rare purchase from Bottlecraft in SD, but one I was glad to make.","  rDev Thanks to WestCoastBeerDude for sending this particular bottle! 2015 vintage 375 mL bottle (I believe the bottling date was 8/3/15 on the label), and consumed on 2/1/18. Poured into a J. Wakefield OG teku glass.  A: Beautiful light gold, and is crystal clear until the last 1/3 of the bottle is poured out - then moderately hazy. A good amount of visible carbonation, but the white head stays small and fades quickly. A pretty beer for sure.  S: Dry Brettanomyces funk, stone fruit and apricots, and mild dry white wine. Cracker malts and a mix of citric and lactic tart. Mild oak tannins. It’s a dry funky Brett, rather than fruity and pineapple.  T: Brett funk, sour lemons and citric acid. Lactic tart and barnyard. Dried apricots. French oak dryness as well. Cracker malts, dry white wine. Some sweet fruity esters and fleshy fruits in the middle. More dry Brett funk, citrus rind, pineapple, and tart juicy fruit near the end. Ultimately finishes dry with the French oak tannins and more stone fruit.  M: A light body and low alcohol flavors. The carbonation sensation is a touch on the low side but not so much as to detract.  O: Very good. The oak was a worry for me – I don’t always appreciate the French oak flavors. But everything plays so nicely with each other here – balanced, nuanced, and complex. Not overly vinous, not overly funky. While I don’t think there’s apricots or peaches in here, that dry flavor pulls through with the citric acid and lemons and adds quite a bit to the flavor profile. Really enjoyable, but likely not my favorite of the “-tion” series.","  rDev Pours a cloudy, deep blond with a rocky cap that lasts a long time, draping the glass in foam. Lemon, white grape, straw, horse blanket in the nose. Oak notes, lemon, rustic funk, saltine pale malts in the taste. Herbal, spicy yeast notes in the back add layers of complexity to the mix. The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with walls of textured, creamy carbonation. The finish is tart, fruity and funky, lasting a long time.  This is yet another stellar, ultra complex and ultra drinkable Wild Ale from the OG producer. It lives up to the hype and is a must try for any fan of the style.","  rDev Got a bottle of this when I was in northern California about 3 /12 months ago visiting my best friend and we went to Russian River's new location.

Has a very carbonated looking, white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a thick, creamy looking, layer of surface foam along with a very thick ring of foam surrounding the inside of the glass. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some bready malts, yeasty esters, and Chardonnay oak along with some Brettanomyces funk notes that's all rounded out with just a hint of lactose. Flavor wise, this starts out with some bready malt that gives way to oaked Chardonnay white wine grape that has a nice tartness upfront that gives way to some yeasty funk and sourness, both from the grape and also from what seems to be some lactose as well as far as my tastebuds are concerned. All the flavors are balanced and compliment each other superbly. WOW!!! Has fairly crisp, also smooth, dry mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Also has a dry finish and aftertaste, and the sour funk really coats the inside of my mouth and my tongue nicely after each sip and lingers for quite awhile after each sip.

Mild aromas, getting hints of lemon to square out the funky yeast smells that punch through. Getting Brett-like qualities.  Very tart, full of white grape must and apple. A nice mineral quality, and if it weren’t for the funk and sharp tartness this has a lot of qualities of a Chardonnay.  Seltzery, crisp, thin body.

That lambic character definitely is present a little bit in Temptation, with some funky met with sweet red bell pepper, then a touch of celery on the finish. The finish is a little off putting to be honest. It's a really well made and complex beer, but it misses the mark a little for me.","  rDev Great pour and aroma, but a bit sour for my taste.

The head has a creamy texture on top with shallow lumps and ripples across its surface. Head retention is good and as it slowly recedes it leaves a nice sheet of thick cobweb lacing with large round gaps in the sheeting. It looks exactly like you would picture a Porter in a magazine.  Aroma: There isn't much going on in the aroma here. It has a bit of a phenolic, rubbery scent. As the beer sits there is a scent of nail polish. Very odd aromas.  Taste: Up front there is nail polish and a bit of toasted caramel. Towards the middle the nail polish character comes through even stronger. There is a pleasant note of coffee and faint burnt carbon. The nail polish character really kills the other flavors.  Mouthfeel: There is a medium roasted grain bitterness to the beer and a body that rests on the upper edge of medium. Carbonation feels fine. Drinkability is low given the flavor and aromas.  Overall: A very disappointing beer. The off-flavors in this beer really hamper any positive characters that might have a chance at getting out.

Lovely complex aroma where coffee, dark chocolate, prunes, oak and sandalwood shine through. Flavour is initially sweet and mellow, then a distinct bitterness comes through. Coffee notes are dominant. There's something undefined strange in the aftertaste that keeps me from giving it a straight  5 . Still, this is a top class porter!","  rDev Anchor Porter pours a dark brown color. Opaque, but still thinner in appearance. Lovely thick khaki head forms on the beer - about 3-4 fingers - and then dissipates leaving a thin layer of velvety foam on top of the beer. The aroma on this is dominated by a strong sweet caramel character. Caramel malt, sweet chewy caramel, and secondary to that stronger note you get notes of roasted malt, toffee, cocoa, and a hint of coffee-like notes. Its honestly kind of sweet on the nose which I wasn't really expecting.   The flavor then follows the nose with a strong caramel toffee character to the beer. Notes of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and a light piney hop character all cascade across the palate. Its mildly sweet. Feel is light to moderately bodied. Very silky smooth and velvety on the mouthfeel. Sprity, but balanced carbonation.","  rDev 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip   A- Black with a two finger light tan head   S- Roasted malts, some chocolate, dark fruits, some toffee, a little earthy.  T- Roasted malts, some coffee, dark fruits, dark chocolate, touch of toffee, some sweet biscuits, earthy.  M- Smooth, medium body, high carbonation.  O- A tasty and nicely balanced Porter, easy to drink.","  rDev Bottled on 8/1/19  Pours a dark brown with deep maroon accents and topped with a dense, multiple fingers of dark khaki froth; great head retention proceeds to a moderate cap and medley of stringy lacing painted around the glass.  Aromas of crisp malted chocolate touched with a hint of dark cherry are strong to open, while herbal hops build from the background from the middle onward; earthy, roasty malt and nutty pine accentuate the close.  Taste behind with a steady roasand tone supported with light roast coffee and cherry skin; cacao husk develops a drying semi-char along the palate, and herbal hops flutter through the finish while a lingering fresh dark chocolate tone lightly coats the throat.  Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a lightly frothed carbonation a consistent presence throughout; roasty char levels the mid-palate before an oily consistency sneaks it's way in alongside subtle bittering to a surprisingly clean finish.  A stalwart of a porter filled with equal parts roasted/hoppy tones as nuanced, malty sweetness. The bittering can feel somewhat overwhelming at times, but offers its own sturdy nuance, and never compromises the hearty drinkability of the overall beer.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a tulip. Purchased within the past month, but dated just over a year ago.  L: Black body with ruby glints; two fingers of dense light brown head that displays tremendous retention and thick sheets of lacing. Gorgeous.  S: Dark chocolate and black licorice are the dominant notes. A hint of almost cinnamon spice as well, with some faint hoppy resin. Quite nice.  T: Licorice starts things off in a big way, with dark roast coffee and baker's chocolate close behind. An almost minty touch of herbaceous hops adds a bitter tinge to a finish that was already leaning toward astringency from the heavily roasted malts. A distinct cola flavor develops as it warms, along with a sarsaparilla-like touch of piquancy. Oversteeped black tea and more cola on the finish. Full-flavored and highly complex, but a bit heavy on the astringency for me.  F: Medium-bodied and frothy. Decent body for the style, but a bit overcarbonated.  O: I really enjoyed digging in to this one, but I don't need a sixpack. It's great to revisit a dry, bitter, complicated American Porter from time to time.  Beers of Fame tick 187/250. Cheers!","  rDev Rich aroma, if not too strong. Sweet caramel, raisins, chocolate.  Deep dark brown, nearly opaque even with a backlight. Tall, thick and creamy milk chocolate colored head that takes its time receding, leaving behind rings of lacing and an uneven bubbly top of the remaining head.  Rich taste as well, dark fruit, chocolate, and smooth initially, with some bitterness coming through in the middle, leading to a relatively dry finish and bitterness lingering on the tongue, along with the very flavorful malt body - again, hints of caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, and roasted malts.  The body is medium, tending toward substantial, especially for a porter.  Overall, a well-constructed porter. Rich and complex flavor, good body, roasted malts complemented by sweet caramel, raisins, and chocolate, moderated by the hop bitterness. The finish is relatively dry, but with hints of the sweetness remaining.  Top notch. Extremely enjoyable and flavorful.","  rDev Bottled 11/10/15; drank 1/23/16 @ the Yarchives.   Opaque brown appearance.   A rough pour yielded a HUGE tan head (careful pouring!); frothy lace.   Oats, cream, root beer &amp; faint coffee notes in the nose.   Medium thick mouthfeel.   Cream, oats &amp; root beer flavors up front; bitter black coffee notes on the finish.   Flavorful yet sessionable; nicely done.","  rDev Pours a clear deep brown with garnet highlights, producing 2+ fingers of mocha, somewhat lasting, foamy head that leaves a beautiful coating of lace. Aroma is toasted pumpernickel, rich dark fruits, dark chocolate, roasted nuts and toffee with hints of licorice and thin coffee. Taste is roasted and bold being semisweet dark chocolate, rich dark bread, raisins, overripe plums, roasted nuts, char, toffee and a hint of smoke. Finishes sweet, bready, chocolatey and fruity with a kick of spice. Aftertaste is a diminished version of the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, creamy, smooth, dry and a little chewy. An excellent American Porter and good example of what it was like before craft started experimenting with so much added coffee and chocolate.","  rDev Anchor Porter brewed by Anchor Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.60% This American Porter pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer glass. The brew has a nice deep brown color with a nice light brown head. The brew has the look of coffee, not saying that is a bad thing. There is a nice amount of lacing to this bree, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. You also pick up some minor sweetness in the smell as well. So far Anchor Porter is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on a lot of nice roasted grains and malts. Then at the end is a nice amount of roasted hops. All in all a well put together Porter. No added flavors just good old Porter. The body is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. The brew would go nice with dinner or a cool day. Overall I am going to give Anchor Porter a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to.Anchor Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this American Porter.  If you are a fan of dark brews an want something without all the coffee, sweetness, you should look this one up. A good soild base Porter.","  rDev Pours a very dark brown, almost black but not quite there, a half inch beige head that dissipated quickly and left decent spotty lacing. Smells and tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, roasted malts, toffee, and a bit of smoke. Additional flavor of molasses is present. Full bodied, light to medium carbonation, creamy mouth feel and a very mildly dry finish.","  rDev Jet black color, just below average carbonation and a decent thick feel. Aroma is all roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, bitter dark chocolate, and black coffee. Taste really follows the nose with a bitterness that I think comes from the roasted coffee flavor and not hops. An above average beer that I would definitely have again","  rDev Dark, smoky and chocolaty. Pours black with skimpy beige head. Aroma of oak barrels, chocolate and peat. Taste is chocolate, bananas and roast grains. Velvety smooth, deep and rich truly enjoyable.","  rDev Serving: Bottle No date  Pours opaque black with a finger of creamy tan head with concetric rings of lacing. All in all this is a classic nutty, coffee-y, chocolate-y porter. Smooth and balanced between sweet and lightly roasty. Medium body and fairly rich with active carbonation. Tasty, substantive and delicious. I'd definitely have it again.","  rDev 355ml bottle. L: Glossy black with an amazing, thick, rich, creamy, long-lasting, mocha head. S: Christmas pudding and a hint of alcohol. T: Spicy hops upfront, coffee in the background, run casks, some hot alcohol. Long, very bitter aftertaste. F: Smooth, light carbonation, very dry finish. O: This is a distinctive porter with considerable gravitas. Rich, bitter, dark fruit &amp; rum flavours, tastes way more alcoholic than its ABV.","  rDev 12oz bottled 11/22/17 poured into a shaker pint glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on bottle. The beer pours dark brown with red highlights and sticky light brown head. The head never completely recedes and leaves rings of lacing. The aroma offers chocolate and roast malt in a small dose. The taste is more roasted malt and dark chocolate with a traditional tangy entry and nice roasted bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, well carbonated and dry in the finish. The label claims natural carbonation and this was well carbonated and delicious. Overall, excellent. This is a prime example of a big flavorful beer, well made, at a reasonable ABV. Recommended.","  rDev Pours quite dark. 1 finger head that dissipated fairly fast when poured from the tap. Head was white. Nice lacing on the glass.  Nose doesn't have much going on.

A: Pours a very dark brown with a one inch, tan to khaki head displaying good retention and excellent lacing. S: Aromas of cafe au last, molasses, and anise.  T: Cafe au last and molasses definitely present, but licorice flavor more evident to palate than nose. Complex and well crafted. Bitterness evident but in good balance. M: Medium to full bodied. Excellent carbonation. Cream mouthfeel.  O: Really an excellent interpretation of the porter style, albeit leaning more toward a stout.

Great retention, due to the wheat, no doubt.  On the nose, underripe mango, dried apricot, (good call from the brewery description) banana, vanilla, hay, white pepper, rich chewy white bready malt.  The mouthfeel is hefty and fluffy but made superbly drinkable through the fairly high carbonation that cuts through it.  A Weizenbock. This is a great beer.","  rDev 330 ml bottle. Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head, nice lacing and lively carbonation. Aroma is of yeast, wheat malt, spices and bananas. Body is full and slightly crisp. Wheat malt, yeast, bananas, peppery alcohol and spices fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy. Very nice brew.","  rDev 500mL bottle. Pale and golden, slightly cloudy, with a massive pillowy white head. A little bit of lemon zest in the aroma? Flavor is like a high gravity wheat beer, like you'd expect from the  weizenbock  label. Not malty sweet, but wheat-sweet. There's a depth of flavor here, but not much dimension (if that makes any sense). Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and finish is likewise cloying. But other than that, taste-wise it's not bad. It does hide its 7.7% ABV remarkably well.  Beer Advocate says this is the #2 rated Weizenbock, but the gap between this and Aventinus is mammoth.","  rDev 500ml bottle into a tall glass. Freshness dating hard to understand.  Looks fantastic in the glass. Faintly hazy pale golden yellow body. Light but continual streams of carbonation. Big bright white head persists down to the last drop, leaving gobs of lacing.   The aroma is a bit odd. Quite a strong musty floral smell.   On tasting, the nose does not come through. What does come through is a delightful slightly sweet banana-apple mix. There is a richness without abv power. Loving this.   Mouth between medium and full, finish faintly drying slightly sweet fruit note. Right at the end, a little warmth comes through.  Overall, clean, very well executed beer. Went with a single bottle rather than a six pack. This was a mistake. Would have this beer again any time, any place.","  rDev 500ml bottle. Cloudy, bright orange with masses of microbubbles and a small but long-lasting head. Orange zest, clove and yeast aromas. Tastes of freshly-squeezed orange juice and ripe banana. Mouthfeel is velvet smooth with alcohol emerging in the finish. A full-bodied but bright and citrusy weizenbock. Another knockout wheat beer from this world-class brewery.","  rDev This must be a  blonde  version of a weizenbock, for I normally encounter darker ones than this. Is this a more authentic Bavarian approach? Hazy golden hue, lush, blooming white head. This is real Bavarian wheat beer, here.  Aroma: Gorgeous! A lot of the citrus-y notes of a typical wizen are here, with more spices. Lemon and wizen yeast notes first, with spices (coriander, clove) thereafter.  Taste: fresh and delicious on the tongue. Zesty, refreshing, and easily consumable. I have to admit that I'm a bit perplexed, for I'm not getting the darker flavors normally found in a weizenbock. Paler malts at play here, I suppose, but then why call it that? Some of those flavors are creeping up, but the don't dominate, just finding their footing on the tongue, and letting the paler malts push it.  The alcohol is popping up just a bit now, we're feeling a little warm now. This golden weizenbock is giving us the hefe weizen flavors, just a shadow of the weizenbock tastes, and the bigger buzz a bock or weizenbock should give.

The beer pours a relatively clear and bright gold to straw color with a fizzy bleached white head foaming up about 2 cm even with gentle pour. The foam has faded to a thin edge layer soon after the pour. Several streams of carbonation rise to the surface but do not replenish the foam. The aroma is heavy with cloves and some banana and a little general spiciness too. Some wheaty twang notes as well. As expected on the nose and appealing too. First sip reveals a light body with fine and tingly carbonation. texture is smooth and a little thin, but sort of fits for the beer. Flavor is cloves, banana and wheat with a little bit of lemon and citrus in the background. The cloves are dominant here just as on the nose.  No hint of any booze and not sure of the hop character here. Its very easy drinking and could be trouble at 7.7%. Very nice smooth beer.","  rDev 500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.7%. Very pale yellow colour, hazy, with a huge white head. Much paler than any other weizenbock I’ve had. Lovely typical sweetish hefeweizen aroma with notes of ripe bananas, cloves and bubblegum. The flavour is sweet and fruity, but still fairly light bodied for its strength. Moderate notes of cloves, very moderate hops. A very different character compared to e.g. Schneider Aventinus, but nice enough to drink.","  rDev 500ml bottle  8440 14:45:24  Poured into a krug shows a hazy, lemon flesh yellow body and supports a tall, living, head of white fluffy foam disappating to a cap and edge leaving random leopard hide lacing.  Aromas of fruit and spice esters flow into the full flavored, and almost prickly feel, taste with a sweet malt base.  Overall a fine example of bock beer.","  Foggy burnt maize with a tall meringue foam head that slowly settles to a blanket of thick whipped peaks leaving thick cobweb lacing.  This is so unbelievably silky and crushable, it glides right down, exhibiting mild wheat that's lightly toasted with a touch of mild zucchini bread-like spice, eschewing clove phenols, thus more delicate.  It's just so pleasant, and semi-sweet, with a slight semi-bitter herbal quality in the exhale, and a hint of banana skin.","  rDev 500 ml bottle  Pours a cloudy yellow golden color, with thick cream colored head. Aroma is bready and a touch of herbal spice. Taste is also dominated by wheat bread, a little bit sweet. Quite pleasant. The weizen yeast is fairly subdued. Good balance. Fuller bodied, smooth.","  rDev The aroma was noticeably yeast forward with a good amount of banana while also showing some spicy notes of cloves. The taste was very banana-y, spicy, and juicy. In the middle, the fruity esters dissipated and the characteristics of the wheat were more noticeable and prominent.","  rDev 330ml bottle fresh from Weihenstephan hill, imported by some jerks in SC. No date  This is a beer consumed on the toilet, Thanksgiving Day 2020. A lot to be thankful for, as always, and I'm choosing this beer to celebrate with. Sadly, it's just okay. Kinda reminds me of a Euro 40 oz'er. Splashes back with plenty of fruity wheat and yeast, clean, not a trace of the 7.7% to be found.

Overall, it's a nice beer.  --- 2021-04-14 Mostly the same kinds of comments -- more of a spicy characteristic that I noted before. I would probably characterize the sweetness as floral. Velvety might be a bit generous.","  rDev Bloody hell, part II.  After trying out this brewer's Dunkel, I couldn't help but take the next step.   Excellent aromas. Esters (banana and juicy fruit) and clove on the nose. The flavors are sweeter than the Dunkel but tasty, following the nose with solid esters and phenols mixed with spicy white pepper yeast, white grape, and winter apple tartness.  Mildly but pleasantly carbonated. Just beyond medium bodied. A bit slick and oily.  For me, this Wehenstephaner isn't quite as good as the Dunkel, but Vitus is still pretty special.","  rDev a: slightly murky golden/light amber color with fainter yellow notes towards the bottom of the glass and some lighter brown towards the top. large, rocky and solid 2-3 finger vibrant white head   s: huge banana, wheat, clove, cardamom, green apple, sweet berries. ripe pears, a touch of funk, bubblegum, dark wheat, and massive fresh dough backbone. fantastic aroma  t: tons of wheat and banana upfront. green apples and pears behind that. major fruity esthers in here. sweet grass, clove, cardamom, and some pepper as well. a touch of caramel and toasted wheat follow. the close is sweet banana, pears, and more wheat  m: medium mouthfeel with high carbonation  o: absolutely awesome beer. great example of the style, nothing to complain about!","  rDev Very tall white thick head with very good retention, forming uneven hills and valleys as it drops, leaving little lacing.

The banana is here, but less dominant than in the aroma, with the other fruit flavors are mixing in more strongly, and the spice is there all the way through. I describe the aroma as containing apple, but in the taste it is more indistinct mix of fall fruits.  Body is substantial, to the thick side, leaving a nice after-effect: a not quite sticky but a pleasant coating.  Overall, an excellent wheat beer, with an interesting mix of flavors that is a joy to drink.","  rDev Hazy deep orangey-gold, with 3 fingers of off-white head, that leaves a good 2  of lacing strewn around the glass.  Smell is like that of a hefe , or a Belgian saison : estery banana bread, overripe pear, wet bread dough, and a little bubblegum and apple pie filling.   Taste is spicy coriander/clove mix, (very) ripe banana, fresh white bread, a slight floral element, and brief hints of candied orange peel. Tounge-bracing moderate bitterness kicks in mid-taste, and lingers well-past finish.   Feel is light-medium, very slightly oily at first, then an (almost) all-consuming very, very fine carbonation tingle/burn takes over, creating an almost-dry finish. I say  almost-dry , because it comes across as dry icing on a lightly jammy item, rather than flat-out  dry  .

As despite 3 years previously living in Berlin Germany, and travels through Bavaria this one had never previously crossed my radar. This beer is honestly 'Epic!'; one of most delicious and enthralling beers I have EVER had.

Ample carbonation.....a bit spritzy....a brighter take on a weizenbock lacking the darker color and bready, dark fruit notes of most in this style.   Still enjoyable but I prefer a bit more breadiness and dark fruitness in this style.","  rDev Fluffy white head that lasts forevah. Mildly opaque gold in color. Finally it settled in to a thin film of bubbles and left some patchy lacing. The usual suspects of banana and clove share the spotlight with bright yeasty and grainy notes. Mmm bread dough. The flavors show more complexity. A mildly toasty sweetness enters with the grain, clove and banana. Quite tasty. But the mouthfeel really is not separate from the flavor. It's carbonation is constant and keeps this vivacious. Also, it's creamy, nearly fluffy, yet finishes a tad dry with leftover banana. Overall, very solid.","  rDev Hazy golden colour, big head with long retention, good irregular lace.  Aroma has a lot of cloves, bananas, malts, citrics. Full body, oily palate, good carbonation.

Two pours into snifter glass. Pink purple pour, pink/off-white head puffy, leaves generous lacing. Strong sweet, slightly tart raspberry aroma. Slightly tart raspberry taste, dry crisp mouthfeel, carbonation fizzy and holds. Overall good pour.","  rDev 355 mL can from a sixer purchased at the LCBO; dated 03.04.19 and served slightly chilled.  Pours a beautiful purplish-magenta colour with good clarity; one finger of foamy, pinkish off-white head lasts for the better part of three minutes, steadily receding down to a tight collar of froth. A messy spattering of lace completes the gorgeous visuals. The aroma is not exactly what I'd call complex - the raspberry fruit flesh &amp; juice both come through, obscuring a hint of the beer's grainy pale malts. I like it, but more of, well, everything would be appreciated.  Thankfully the juicy flavour profile saves the day - I love raspberries, and Rübæus delivers a bushel and a half of authentic raspberry deliciousness. Sweet, tangy raspberry jam and fruit flesh start things off, underlain by a grainy pale malt backing that remains firmly in the back seat... or even stuffed into the trunk, because there's no room inside this metaphorical car for anything but raspberry. Light raspberry juice and cherry sweetness continue through to the finish, with raspberry tartness lingering into a fruity, mildly juicy aftertaste. Light-medium in body, with low carbonation levels that limply brush against the surface of the palate; feels smooth and slick. I don't dislike the texture but it seems to be missing something in that respect. In any event, it's excessively easy to knock back, and a damn pleasure to do so.  Final Grade: 4.07, an A-. I'd recommend Rübæus to anyone who has ever enjoyed a raspberry beer in the past - or to anyone who has never experienced a quality one in the first place. I haven't committed to a six pack of fruit beer in years, but in this case I'm not even sure it'll be enough to last me through the weekend. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, this is technically the lowest grade I've given to a Founders product - but I suppose that says more about the overall quality of their portfolio than it does about this brew specifically.","  rDev 12oz canned 3/13/19 (2 months ago) poured into a Founder's shaker pint glass at fridge temp 5.7% ABV 15 IBU. The beer pours mostly bright red tinted light amber with rose tinted off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is faint grain and red raspberry. The taste is semisweet red raspberry jam on top of a mild nuetral grain bill. The finish is non bitter, but not cloying and semidry. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with average carbonation. Overall, very good. I like that balance on this fruit beer. It's not really tart and it's not super sweet either.","  rDev Pretty tasty stuff, even though I wouldn’t want it every day.  Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Pleasant brownish red color with nice pink head and good lacing. Wonderful raspberry smell and taste. Very good fruit beer when in the mood for such.","  rDev 12oz can poured into 14oz tulip. Poured a clean, clear light red color, with just a thin cap of white head that had low retention and light lace.  The aroma leads with berry, but there's a nicely solid grain base in the background. Similar on the tongue,with berry leading the front and the malt owning the back.  The body was a bit fuller than I would have liked, a bit lighter would have improved drinkability. Overall, a pretty nice brew.Worth your time if you see it.","  rDev Pours a clear reddish color with a half inch light pink head that dissipated fairly quickly and leaves numerous spots of lacing. Smells of raspberries and a hint of malt in the background. Tastes like raspberry juice, on the sweet side, very little tartness with some malt and wheat. Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly dry mouth feel.","  rDev (12 oz can, canned on 06.21.18... poured into a Gibraltar glass)  L: crystal-clear ruby liquid; huge stand of pink-tinged foam building up above the rim of the glass; thin collar remains, scattered islands of lace  S: ridiculously raspberry; maybe some malt in the background - not much else to say... powerful, redolent, not boozy; doesn't convey too much impending sweetness  T: rich, dense raspberry that doesn't hit too sweet, backed by a brawny, relatively dry malt foundation which flashes a little caramel in the finish... aftertaste is relatively dry, with raspberry essence and a dried pumpkin stem note (flavor and vegetal bitterness) lightly lingering... second sip reveals a more jammy quality to the raspberry; back end dryness opens up more in the back of the palate, though a peppery, almost cinnamon-like phenolic note builds  F: light-medium bodied, very soft carbonation; mild bit of warmth let off in back of palate, with a very subtle peppery burn (or is that more a flavor?)... any viscosity hangs in the front of the palate; back end has more a sensation of having taken Binaca, but don't want to overstate that feeling... very easy drinking  O: noteworthy if not interesting or exotic brew, glad I finally got around to trying it... I could see having this again; interested to try the nitro version, but it could be a watery slop","  Poured into a small chalice: color is nearly red with some amber tones, head is white with very fine bubbles and presents about 1/2 inch thick, head dissipates to thing ring along the glass.   Smell is nearly all raspberry but some hints of lighter wheat malt or bread are present.  Taste is similar with raspberry heavy flavors, a bit sweeter than expected, touching on syrup like but then it dries out some. Light bready malt noted.   Mouthfeel is on the sweet side, light tart component, dries out a bit on the end but there is a strong lingering raspberry flavor.   Overall an intense fruit beer and the freshness of the raspberry flavor is impressive, light beer like qualities.","  rDev Really nice ruby red color. Around a medium body as well as carbonation. Aroma is raspberry,raspberry jam,followed by a slight bit of malt , mixed berry,and a little fliral. Taste is raspberry,there's a little yeast,some malt, tart candy,and a lot more raspberry. They did manage to make it still taste real and not artifical, flavor comes off really enjoyable. The raspberry jam taste is a little sweet which is the only fault but overall I thought it was a great beer","  Can from Brewers Haven. Beautiful pour into a Lindeman's flute. dark amber/ ruby tinges, light pink head. Fruity, berry aroma. Taste is also fruity, raspberries, and brings some tartness, and bit of dryness. Bright and crisp, sweet and tart. Really nice.","  rDev Great-tasting fruit ale with just the right amount of raspberry. Creamy head and great dark red color. Notes of malt biscuit and wheat, never too sweet and finishes light and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The nitro version on tap was significantly more enjoyable than the bottled version.","  rDev Had this one more times than I can count. If you're a fan of fruit ales, it's famn near perfection. Full of both tart and sweet raspberry goodness with a bready malt to compliment and a floral finish. One of the few ales I've had that I like on nitro as much as out of the bottle.","  rDev 1L howler from Sherbrooke Liquor store, part of a Founders mini-tap takeover this past weekend. I'll have to investigate what the name means later.  This beer pours a clear, medium reddish amber colour, with three fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat fizzy pale pink head, which leaves some decent broken cobweb lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.   It smells of raspberry cream pie - the berries, semi-sweet caramel malt, and lactose - with just a touch of earthy, musty, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, raspberry puree, raspberry jam, mildly tart fresh raspberries, and more well understated earthy, leafy, and musky floral raspberries (uh, I mean hoppiness).   The carbonation is fairly restrained in its lackadaisical frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and essentially smooth. It finishes off-dry, the malt starting to finally catch up to the still heady raspberry fruitiness.   Overall - this is one fruit beer that certainly delivers the goods, as it is raspberry confection all the way, without ever getting too sweet and/or cloying. Refreshing, and pretty easy to put back, as a bit of snow starts to melt on a surprisingly temperate early March afternoon.","  rDev 355ml can. L: Dark red and clear. Two fingers of pink, bubbly head collapses quickly and leaves a couple of spots. S: Ripe, warm raspberries. T: 100% raspberry. A hint of sweetness up-front then mouth-coating, rich, tart raspberry flavours. F: Medium/light body, some carbonation with a long, dry finish. O: I will admit I’m not usually a fan of fruit beers. But I understand and appreciate the appeal of this brew. The raspberry flavour is rich and natural tasting. Works well served a little warmer on this late winter evening but I imagine it could really zing served cold in the summer.","  rDev Pours a ruby red coloration with a medium creamy head. Smells of raspberries. Tastes of raspberries. There really isn't a lot else going on here, except maybe a little caramelly malt, it's almost like drinking raspberry syrup. It's not too sweet though, there really is a very balance between sweetness and sourness, even with a little hint of bitterness. There is a certain crisp dryness to it as well. Great summer beer for raspberry lovers.","  rDev This beer is about raspberries. Pours a mixture of pink and yellow, soft white head 1/3 . Aroma does impart raspberries, so that is good. Mild grain behind it.   Taste, hey like I said, its all about the raspberries. There is almost nothing else going on, seemed like they used a mild blonde ale malt base, and kept the hops out of the way. And then they just dropped all kinds of raspberry. Its really not that sweet. They went with just the fruit. Lots of carbonation on it. Could fit the refreshing descriptor, just depends what you're looking for. Still has a relatively dry presence in the mouth feel despite the use of fruit. I think they probably hit the mark they were shooting for when they made this beer.","  rDev Late Check-in of this beer from Town Center Tap House, Daleville, VA. July 1, 2014. Lost in the archives... Day of the unfortunate US loss to Belgium in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.","  rDev On nitro.  A - Massive creamy off white head with a ruby Amber color and no carbonation.  S - Caramel malt and raspberries. Has a little bit of a musty note.  T - Raspberries and light caramel.  M - Medium body and a little thin on the back end.  O - Sweer, but not overly sweet.","  rDev I'm surprised how much I like this. Based on the average score, which I will supersede. Lovely red color and red tint to the head.  Both the raspberry taste and aroma are pure raspberry pleasure. The nice supporting base helps cut down any acidic or sweetness. There seems to be a streak of hops in there too offering a soft bitterness and a bit of herbal taste. This if fully carbonated, which I don't mind with fruit beers. Also helps slow what would otherwise be a very easy and quick drink. ","  rDev Cherry red with almost a hint of haze, little carbonation, and 2 fingers of pink head.  Smells of raspberries and hint of lager, malt, and yellow, fizzy beer.  Tastes of sweet, and bitter qualities, almost like artificial sugar. Then raspberries come in, and finally it ends with a pilsener maltiness.  Medium, slightly syrupy body, with moderately low carbonation.   Finally found this one today, Oct 24th, 2017, in Chiang Mai, where I am drinking it. Sweeter than I'd expected, a little weird, but I like the overall package somewhat.","  rDev From Saveur Biere.

So far Hop Wallop has the look an smell of most IPA'S on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. This is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with hop bitterness at first, then it sticks around. You also pick up on nice smooth earthy grains and malts to tie it all together. The body is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.50% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. Hop Wallop IPA would go nice with dinner. The mouth feel is Bold, Hoppy, Rich, Clean Smooth and Refreshing.

Overall, the hops is this beer are quite intense and work well together.","  rDev Best by 5/11/19  Pours a crystal clear dirty gold with a small but persistent off-white head; decent retention yields plenty of speckled lacing holding to the glass alongside a faint collar with solid longevity.  Aromas of deep, almost sweaty notes of dank hops, grapefruit rind, and dense pine balanced only by a stiff, crackery malt backbone.

Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, snappy, and with no shortage of weight to it on the swallow; not bitter, not overly malty, just excellent balance on the palate while maintaining a consistent strength. Light-medium body on the palate is bolstered by medium, excellently balanced carbonation.  The hops here are so aggressive and yet well-tempered, this is at incredible level as far as sessionable, old-school IPAs go; where the hops are aggressive, all other elements are refined for drinkability, resulting in the type of beer I’d take pleasure in drinking frequently.","  rDev A: slight haze; medium gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;  S: predominantly pine with a little lemon in the backgoround;  T: a lot of malt here; the hops ping pong back and forth between lemon and floral; a little sweet throughout with mild bitterness on the finish;  M: medium bodied moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;  O: nicely done; a little too sweet for my taste;","  rDev Revisited 1/11/20  A-Pours a clear golden color with a generous head and lacing A-Aroma has hoppy hints T-The taste follows the nose with an abundant hoppy and bitterness flavor M-A medium bodied well carbonated beer O-A good Imperial IPA","  rDev I'd call this a throwback IPA, as it really reminds me of what I was looking for back in the 90s. Bitter, somewhat hoppy nose, old school flavors. The nose is probably the least interesting part of the beer. Pine and a little citrus along with some earthy and herbal notes. A bit of a mish-mash. Taste has a big malt backbone, which I think is fine (I'm not so sure why so many people hate any malt in their IPAs). But the hops are really bring bitterness as opposed to flavor here. Again, more of an old school pine thing going on. Overall, decent but not interesting or exciting. I didn't rate Dirt Wolf as high as most either, so maybe this brewer's IPAs just aren't for me.","  rDev Clear gold with good effervescence and three fingers of creamy off-white head that last a good while and leave heavy lacing.  Skunky pine, forest floor, flowers, apple juice, pineapple and biscuity malt in the nose.  A little residual fruit juice and white wine sweetness in the taste, with strong floral and pine hops in the finish — but not exactly the wallop I remember from twelve years ago. The aftertaste is a really nice mix of pine hop bitterness and that light sweetness.  Sticky, syrupy, medium-bodied feel with moderate carbonation. The beer really coats and sticks to the mouth, letting the flavors linger.  Not quite the palate wrecker I remember, but still a real treat. Would love this as a seasonal release for the Eagles postseason.","  rDev Both darker and with more haze than average. Mild 1/3  head. Aroma was not as hoppy as I expected, some residual sweet notes.  Can't figure out why this seems so sweet. Has the bitterness, but not a lot of hop flavor. Interesting hop choice on this one. Never struck me as a hop wallop, struck me more like someone wanted to make a Hopslam, amp up the honey at the expense of the hops, and instead of using tried and true proprietary, went with more noble like hops and experimental stuff.","  rDev On tap: Pours clear as day, a splash of orange in a golden lake. A bit of froth around the lake, nothing outrageous but present. Agitate the lakes and the froth bubbles; leave it alone it will stick to the shore.  The nose speaks more to the growth around the lake, vegetal, slightly flowery, maybe a hint of fruit are all growing nearby. I get an oniony note in some sniffs that has me wondering. Definitely more herbal as my nose approaches the shoreline.  Clean opening with a honey and lightly metallic opening which to me indicates something  noble  in the depths of this beer. Almost too clean, I though initially. But the evidence of the shore vegetation seeps into the taste, more herbal and grassy than vegetal.  The rolling of the beer is nice, enough rocking to make it an interesting ride, but not enough to toss the boat. The break between the choppy opening and the bitter end is nice. A little drying from resin and alcohol keeps the beer in below its flood stage.  Ok-that was fine trying to keep up the metaphor. But this was a beer that I started out thinking - eh, it's decent but nothing special. I can view this as a more classic east coast DIPA, and a good version of it. Subtle in its nature, especially compared to newer hop bombs, but enough clean malt and sneaky bitterness here to be quite enjoyable.","  rDev Had on-tap at the Victory Brewery and in bottle many times.  L: Pours a deep golden, semi-opaque, with thick white head that falls quickly and laces the glass.  S: Evergreens and citrus. Hops! Lots and lots of hops.

A little zesty, and definitely a sipper.  O: A very strong Imperial IPA from Victory and a shame it was discontinued. Although I do enjoy the 'Dirt Wolf' my heart will always be with the Hop Wallop.","  rDev  Horace 'Hop' Wallop headed West a broken man. For in the City of Blues a Miss LuLu Belle Lager had left him thirsting for more. Drawn by wild tales of riches to be had in the gold mines, Hop pressed on westward. His last nickel spent on a prospecting pan, Hop's hunger got the best of him. Two fistfuls of barley and three of some wild and wayward hops tossed in a pan with some clear water was to be his meal. But sleep overcame him and he later awoke to a bubbling, cacophonous concoction. Overjoyed with the beautiful ale he had made, Hop realized the secret of the green gold he had discovered in those fresh hops. Celebrated far and wide, Hop Wallop lives on in this vivid ale with his words, 'hoppiness is happiness.' Enjoy!  Brewed in the style of an Imperial India Ale. Previously a year round 6 pack, Hop Wallop was recently discontinued in lieu of Victory's new 4 pack offering, the Dirtwolf DIPA. Always available as a common find in the local area, this can still be found in a few spots around town, even months after retirement. This is my send off review.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a tulip glass. Served north of 55º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a medium-thick creamy froth head of a golden cream color over a very hazy unfiltered deep amber body. Plenty of sediment lies in suspension and carbonation is modest. Retention is good and lacing is light and spotty. 4  (Smell) Biscuity pale and caramel malts with a soft peppery, grainy edge. The hop profile has faded, but what remains is a blend of floral, lemony and tropical fruit notes with a medium bitterness. A mellow yeast profile provides subtle esters and fruity notes that round out the aroma. Potency is medium. 3.5  (Taste) Based on the aroma, one would expect this drink to be much lighter drinking. Spicy biscuity malts and peppery grains are amplified tremendously in the flavor, up front-and center and provide a robust body without an overbearing sweetness. Hop flavors are subdued in depth and complexity, but do generate a significant bitterness to counter the flavors. Very tasty and aggressively-flavored Imperial India Pale Ale. 4  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, grainy, mildly chewy with a light syrup drizzle. Carbonation adds some crispness and spritely textures for a charismatic texture collectively. Body is medium/heavy for the style and medium/heavy overall. Alcohol presence is medium. The balance is in favor of bitterness, and the earthy grain notes build it up further. Finishes very mildly dry with a dash of citrus juice. 3.75  (Overall) I love the assertive malt profile in this beer as it really makes this Double IPA a memorable one for me. While it is edgy in places it's not too harsh to enjoy nor is it too light to sip delicately. Bitterness is enthusiastically bold in this beer and the flavors make it very enjoyable and filling. I miss it already. I can only assume that this should return in the near future, even if it were a seasonal, this is a very enjoyable India Pale Ale. 4  Victory Brewing Company's Hop Wallop Very Hoppy Ale 3.93/5.00","  rDev 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/21/2014. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky cream colored head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts.

Very nice aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, and bread on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice DIPA. All around good balance and complexity of hop and light malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","  rDev ORIGINAL REVIEW, 6/28/13: Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  a: 4.0 Yummy deep clear gold. Finger thick head dissipated to a light even surface foam, a thin ring and heavy lacing which hung on for most of the consummation.  s: 3.75 Vaguely citrus. t: 4.25 Intense orange-pine hops.. More on the pine side as it warmed, and more deliciously so. m: 4.0 Medium due to the hop bite. Savory to sip.  o: 4.0 Lived up to its name! A wonderful summer sipper which held its own beside the cigar I smoked while drinking it. Delightful.  UPDATE 10/30/13: Found some leftover bottles to try again. Especially wanted to do a side by side with the new DirtWolf which is replacing it. Will have a DirtWolf in a bit and do a comparison review under DirtWolf.  NEW REVIEW: Poured into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass from the 12 oz. bottle. No dates on the bottle or label, but I presume this has a few months on it by now.   a: Clear gold. Brisk pour produced a huge three inch dense white head which almost spilled over the top of the glass but held a wondrous curve a quarter of an inch above the rim. Eventually receded to lumpy surface foam and excellent patterned lacing. A bottle conditioned gem!  s: Moderate citrus and pine,.   t; Pine and citrus flavor without much of the promised hop wallop forward. Its age could be showing. More like a good strong single than a double. Later, the hop presence built. Dryish finish with some hop bite at the sides of the tongue. High ABV was not very evident.  m: Smooth medium. Adding the dregs after the halfway mark boosted the body even more.  o: Reconfirmed my earlier review of this as a great summer sipper. Tasty and refreshing, but now definitely coming up a bit short in the hop wallop dept., at least early on. Still a tasty, very drinkable high ABV DIPA.","  rDev Serving type - bottle  Appearance - Golden tan, straw yellow with a creamy 1 inch head and nice lacing.  Smell - Orange, grapefruit, lemon, pine. Some sweet yeasty sugars, added spices and a little alcohol at the finish.  Taste - Nice blast of citric and bitter hops at first sip. Plenty of orange and grapefruit with some pineapple. Sweet sugars add a little sweetness to mellow some of the bitterness. Has some alcohol warmth and minor malts at the finish.  Mouthfeel - Hops bitter tounge, palette and coat mouth. Yeasty sugars add some sweetness, Alcohol is present but not too overpowering.   Overall - A nice hoppy dipa. A real balanced mix of hop bitterness, sweet citric fruits and yeasty sugars. Has great flavor and really drinkable for being 8.5% and id guess 100+ ibu's. Very affordible and well done.","  rDev 12oz bottle,  Enjoy By May 24 2014  printed on the neck of the bottle A - hazy tangerine body, rocky off-white head, great head retention; thick, chunky lacing is left on the glass as it slowly fades S - fruity, tropical nose, mango, pineapple, mandarin, caramel T - tropical again, but pungently bitter with mango, passion fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, caramel, honey, biscuit; nice complexity M - resiny yet creamy, medium-full body, moderate carbonation O - wow, over 4 years since I had this one and it's even better than I remember.

Taste: A good balance between bready, caramelish, and lightly honeyish malt and floral, citrusy, piney, and resinous hops. The label reads 85 IBUs but that's hard to believe given its smoothness. It finishes drying with residual notes of pine, honey,  dankness , and lemon and orange as a bit of residual maltiness fades.

Cycling through our HopBack vessel and dry-hopping method, this bold Imperial Pale Ale emerges rife with sticky citrus rind, pine balm and tropical fruit.  Brewed in the style of an American IPA, available in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on year-round draft.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a tulip glass.  (Appearance) Pours a smooth, foamy head of a creamy off-white tone over a golden-hued amber with high clarity and fine, lively carbonation. Retention is very good and lacing is moderate and patchy. 4.75  (Smell) Pale and crystal malt body with a modest sweetness and high cleanliness meets a moderate hop profile of citrus pith and gentle tropical fruit notes with a moderate bitterness. Enjoyable yet shallow with mild aromatic qualities overall. Potency is light. 3.75  (Taste) The flavor largely follows the aroma, with a gentle, clean pale malt body with subtleties of pilsner and crystal malt sweetness, finishing with a gentle hop profile bitterness of tropical fruit essence and citrus rind, very light in flavor and with a relatively light bitterness, yet substantial enough to effectively counter the body. Very light delivery in flavor and a high drinkability- would be sessionable aside from the higher than average ABV. 3.75  (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, frothy, smooth, clean and moderately dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a medium frothiness and a medium crisp finish. Body is shy of medium for the style, short of medium overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to hoppy bitter. Alcohol presence is very low and there are no off characters. 4.25  (Overall) Troegs delivers a very enjoyable, albeit light-drinking IPA in Perpetual that does a good job at promoting the desirable subtleties of the hops without overloading on hop bitterness, and keeping a gentle, clean and sessionable malt backbone to balance it all out. It comes together a bit underwhelming on my end, and I think a beer of this caliber and ABV could aim for a richer malt and hop body and flavor without significant complications to the beer's flavor. I enjoyed Perpetual but it doesn't stand out distinguished as an American IPA standard, perhaps at a lighter ABV it would fare nicely as a session IPA. 3.75  Troegs Brewing Company's Perpetual IPA 3.86/5.00"]},{"Name":"Wisconsin Belgian Red","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/590/1577/","Brewery":"New Glarus Brewing Company","Style":"Fruit and Field Beer","Alcohol":4.00,"Score":97.0,"Comments":["  rDev Pours a solid burgundy with a firm haze / fog to the transparency.

I finally have the chance to try this beer, thank you, Jay, much appreciated. The beer is 40 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish tint with good retention. I was not expecting much retention in the head of the beer, this is a fruit beer. The beer having some retention is impressive, I have seen similar styles fall flat quickly. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a dark reddish hue with a dark copper hue. This beer is clear, considering this is a fruit beer. I was expecting some sediment or something. It does not distract from the appearance. The overall appearance is above average.   The initial aromas in the beer are cherries, sugar syrup, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect oak, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, grassy, and a hint of floral. The aromas are cherry dominant, it is hard for me to pull any other aromas out.   The flavors in the beer are cherries, malts, grass, lightly toasted malts, oak, wheat, a note of earth, floral esters, a hint of phenols, and a note of pharmaceutical.   The mouthfeel is slightly tart and dry.   The body of the beer is medium, medium-light carbonation, and full finish.   Is this a beer? It is simply one awesome beer. The fruit flavors are bright and vibrant. The malt and wheat are subtle but there and the oak finishes the beer perfectly. I wish I had many more in the fridge.","  rDev Nice rich red that's got some brown to it. Dirty head that sticks to the sides, before retreating to swirl and ring.   Nose is boldly sweet cherries. Candied cherries. It's just straight candied cherries. Maybe a hint of spices (clove, cinnamon), but through and through this is sweet sweet cherries. Not quite maraschino, but almost. The missus loves it. It's sweeter than I was anticipating, almost sickly so, and I think sweeter than I'd like.   Thankfully it's not quite as sweet tasting as it smells. I think my mis-expectations were driven by the 'belgian red' aspect of the name, so I was thinking something significantly more sour. There's a definite tartness to the taste, but even then I wouldn't call it sour, and it doesn't match up with my limited experience with belgian reds (flanders style). But I am drilling into the wrong things here.  The flavour is a pleasant blend of the sweetness from the cherries and a nice tart finish that actually has elements of tart cherries/tart cherry juice, which I enjoy quite a bit. Also a lot of 'red' flavour a la fruit punch, but again, thankfully not as cloyingly sweet.  As stated, it's got some tart acidity, and some bright effervescence, but is otherwise very smoothe.   This is a masterfully put together beer. I can see why it gets the love it does. It doesn't happen to match straight up with my personal preferences, especially when it comes to cherries (and primarily on the nose), but I can see why people love it, and it is undeniably very well put together.  Much gratitude to @FBarber for sending this along my way during NBW BIF #13! Thanks Frank!","  rDev Bottle poured into a stemmed new glarus glass   One finger fizzy off white foam cap settles to a thin layer over a translucent deep ruby brown liquid. Some lacings   Aroma is cherries,   Taste is cherries, spice, cinnamon , sweet tart, crisp , mouth watering  Low sudsing  Delicious beer, repeatable","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a tulip   A- pours a clear and bright ruby color with a one-finger foamy off-white head that has great retention before leaving some lacing behind  S- bold and fresh cherries dominate the nose up front, followed by undertones of vanilla, chocolate, red licorice, wheat and some dry vinous notes  T- Sweet and rich cherries hit the tongue, providing bold authentic cherry flavor, followed by undertones of vanilla and some earthy spice. Mid-palate is mouth watering, with just a hint of tartness kicking in from the cherries, followed by chocolate. The finish turns slightly vinous, but remains sweet, adding another layer of cherry that continues into the linger  M- medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns into a creamy and silky finish  O- a near perfect cherry showcase, the standard bearer of fruit beers","  rDev Bottle reads 'J240'  Pours a clear, vivid ruby red hue (with brownish accents almost reminiscent of an oud bruin) topped with just over a finger of frothy, beige-white foam; decent head retention leaves a paper-thin cap, moderate, frothy collar, and a uniform spread of eclectic, dense, webby lacing surrounding the inner walls of the glass.  Aroma is expectedly saturated with cherry depth as a subtle prickle builds with an earthy melange to add an earthy layer; savory lactic acid steadily feeds into deeper tones of cherry sorbet through the middle of the bouquet, with a dirty, vinous quality just underneath.  Taste of punchy cherry Jolly Ranchers opens, developing in density to fresh cherry nectar and an attenuated pie-filling sweetness as the profile intermingles suggestions of vanillin alongside lactic acid over the mid-palate; becomes a touch jammy on the back end, with further esters of red berries beneath the already dominant fluctuations of cherry notes offering a slightly more layered fruit experience.  Mouthfeel brings a semi-dense, medium-full body in harmony with a moderate-high carbonation; juicy upfront with a savory peak over the mid-palate; a mild acidity and tartness grows before giving in to a spritzy grit into back end, drying quickly to an exceedingly quenching level on the finish and imploring another sip.  Intense with waves of authentic cherry in tandem with a body crafted for preserving its most refreshing and fruit-forward qualities, New Glarus strikes again with a beautifully conceived, straightforward and yet highly nuanced fruit beer; I'm admittedly not huge in cherry, but this is yet another undeniable achievement from the brewery.","  rDev Bottle courtesy of JohnnyHops.  Looks like cherry juice (not surprisingly).  Pink foamy head. A little lace. Fairly high carbonation.  Smells and Tastes like cherries. Almost an artificial sweet cherry jolly rancher candy flavor. It’s super good, and super sweet. Maybe a little tartness but not a lot. Mouthfeel fairly fluffy. Very lambic-like or fresh squeezed cherry juice (not sure I’ve ever had that).","  rDev This is incredible. Poured into a snifter, this was a clear orange-ruby color with a modest off-white head. Aroma and taste lined up perfectly, showcasing bright fresh cherries that was as intense as advertised. A subtle wheat flavor balanced this, reminding me that this was beer and not fruit juice. Slightly tart enough to be refreshing but remain crushable. Medium bodied, clean-tasting, and lively carbonated. Wow was this great.","  rDev 12oz  World Champion  bottle with no date  No head, ruby red with orange edges. Smell is all cherry, taste is 90% fresh cherry juice with hints of a mild belgian beer lurking around the edges. Unique and amazingly flavorful. Even if it is almost exclusively cherry juice in flavor, it is an authentic flavor and it never dips into robotussin-esque artificiality.   Over a pound of cherries per bottle! And it shows. EDIT: in that case, Robotussin must use over two!!!  EDIT: in recent years, I dunno what happened... maybe it's my taste buds. I wish some of my  friends  were still around so I could ask if I'm crazy or it's just my pallet growing more (less) sophisticated. RN this is a drain pour, I'd rather drink 'tussin, at least I'd feel something. 4% is a joke. Years ago this was top quality, c'mon, what is goin' on....  Avoid this overpriced crap. I mean.. it's okay for gas station beer, but if that is how far NG has fallen, that it's brands can be only favorably compared when described in that way.. then this world is truly busted. Wake me when the bad dream's over.. Okay it's not that bad, I'm just dramatic.... and accurate.","  rDev The brewer's description of this as  the marriage of wine and beer  is spot on. Think sweet Door County cherry wine, with a light malt backbone and a touch of hop bitterness. Beautiful pour into a champagne flute. Brownish-tinged deep red, with ruby highlights and thick off-white head that left some spotty lacing as it settled. Fruit forward on the nose and palate, with tons of tart cherry as expected. Good carbonation, with a surprisingly dry finish for as sweet as this is. Not sour or  funky,  just pleasantly sweet and tart. Perfect vehicle for the Montmorency cherry, and a fabulous pairing with Wisconsin cheese curds.","  rDev Pours a deep red Kool-Aid color — clear, but very dark, with a brownish and purplish hue. It’s very rich looking, and is topped by a half-finger of tannish head that quickly settles into a soupy crown that leaves thin, sloppy lacing.  Huge waves of cherry syrup stand out in the aroma before bringing the beer anywhere close to my face. It’s sweet, almost like a sugary convenience-store cherry pie pastry. There’s a slight medicinal and even nail polish element beneath. Maybe even a ghost-like impression of cherry pits, if those have a smell.  The taste is straight-up, just-about-to-brown cherries. Fleshy, overripe, cherry juice excellence. Lightly sour. Lightly tart. Just a hint of solvent-like astringency in the finish.   The feel is full-bodied, smooth and creamy, with a hint of stickiness and some light, but peppery carbonation.  I’m not sure what makes this Belgian, but that’s okay. It’s cherry juice at its finest. Not something I’d want to session, but delicious as a sipper. Superior beer from start to finish.","  rDev The best fruit and field beer ever made? Makes me want to move to Wisconsin. Guess I’ll need to make a steady trade partner instead.  Sweet, but not medicinal. Completely crushable. So good. Wish I had an unlimited supply.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass shows a cloudy brownish-red body briefly supporting a fluffy 1in cream colored head and leaving a clean glass behind.  Aroma of tart cherries joins the flavor of sweet cherries for an enjoyable palate adjustment. Some deep darkness in those sweet cherries.  Mouthfeel is a ccrisp, medium-leaning lighter and clings to the mouth.  Overall, better than good.","  rDev Poured from a wax-topped bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2016 edition.  L: Clear mahogany red pour with thin fizzy off-white head. Falls fast... modest lacing.  S: Cherry pie... sweet/tart and fruity.  T/F: Follows the nose. Baking cherries... tart and sweet without being too sweet or 'sour'. Gets the salivary glands going. Complex... red wine and plum but mostly cherry juice/pie/candy.

Now to find more of it....","  rDev Bottle st share. Murky pour, muddy violet color, thin ring of head. Aroma recalls a freshly opened jar of jam. Taste is wonderfully sweet and smooth, superb feel too. Sweet, hint of tartness. Juicy. Excellent.","  rDev 25 oz bottle poured into snifter.   Pours a deep, dark cranberry color with a pinkish off-white head of 1 finger.   Aroma is mouth-watering, full of cherries and cherry preserves, cherry sucker, and cherry sours.   Flavor is explosive and intense! So many facets of cherry here. It's like a cherry filled cherry. Cherry pucker, cherry sours, cherry sucker, with plenty of sour elements of funk as well.   Feel is puckering and tart, squeezes your mouth of every last salival drop. Nice finish.   Overall, a cherry-lover's beer. The hateful reviews are the stuffed shirts of the beer community. Fabulous sour, tons of cherry flavor, unbelievable saturation of pure cherries and an almost incomprehensible feat. New Glarus is simply unmatched in their fruit ales. End of story.","  rDev Beautiful deep cherry red gold color with white cap and lacing.  An aroma that immediately reminds me of tart wild cherries followed by a sweeter cherry scent as if two species had been blended.  Taste is cherry in abundance, I can't say that eating ripe cherries would taste any more cherry. The combination is complex with sweet cherry leading and tart puckery cherry finishing. There is an over riding sweetness throughout that may not be to everyone's taste.  Texture is medium-full with enough carbonation to give a sprightly lift to things.  If you like cherry or know someone who does this may be a good choice.","  rDev A 1 pint 9 fl. oz. bottle with no bottled on or best before date (but I think 2017 designed labels). Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.  Appearance: A cloudy deep purple red with a big two finger beige head that had decent retention while leaving some lacing.  Aroma: Tart, cherry, artificial candied cherry with hints of oak and almond.  Taste: Tart, lightly sweet, lightly sour, cherry, oak and almonds.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with low to moderate carbonation.  Overall: Wonderful as the tart and sour balanced out the sweetness leaving behind cherry and almond fruity goodness.","  rDev A - Pours a beautiful ruby red with a two finger off white head.

New Glarus are the kings of fruit beers.","  rDev Unknown vintage; drank 5/1/18 @ the Yarchives.   Cloudy, ruby red appearance.   A violent pour yielded a small off-white head; decent lace.   Cherry &amp; candied sugar notes in the nose; slight Luden's cough drop vibes here.   Sticky medium mouthfeel.   Mildly tart cherry &amp; candied sugar flavors; mild honeyed grain finish.   Sweet as hell but enjoyable; 6oz is probably enough, though.","  rDev I received this from @swenny916. Poured into cylindrical glass. It pours a pretty clear ruby color with orange hues at the top and bottom of the glass. The thin, ecru-colored head dissipated quickly. It features a fragrant aroma of fresh cherry with some subtle yeast and spice. It has a strong malt backbone but the taste is overwhelmingly cherry and it's cloyingly sweet. with a subtle cracker taste at the finish. The mouth feel is viscous and syrupy with moderate carbonation, and with an ABV of only 4% it's almost like drinking soda. Overall, this is a fascinating beer. The cherry taste is amazing! Although I'm generally not a fan of sweet fruit beers, this is worth trying. I'm glad I did.","  rDev I admired the particular shade of red and light-catching translucence of the pour. As soon as I took a sniff, though, I was transported back to my teenage years, in which Jell-O featured heavily. I don't mean that in a bad way: not being a cherry aficionado, I couldn't identify a  Door County cherry,  but I could tell you that this beer smells like Jell-O. Delicious gelatin treats of my youth. I've half a mind to put this in the freezer overnight and see what happens.","  rDev Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. No dating information found on bottle. Ruby red colored body, slightly cloudy. Pinkish white head settles to ring fed by bubbles. Some strings of lacing. Cherry aroma, complimented by oak barrel.  Sweet and tart cherry taste, joined by green apple, oak, slightly spicy hops, and light malt. Slight vinous wine like aspect. Medium and syrupy mouth feel. Good carbonation support.  A magnificent fruit beer is expressed here. Cherry is the emphasis but the beer is not too sweet nor too cloying. Beautiful presentation. An excellent use of Door County cherries; the aroma and taste are authentic. More than just cherry juice, and enhanced and balanced by the malts/wheat and hops used in the brewing process. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 10/20/2018  Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Lots of cherry in the aroma and taste. The cherry flavor is so much more than a cough syrup expression. Lots of balance here, with the cherry addition a true star.

Not my favorite. It just seems a bit darker than other Hefeweizen’s, and it has too much seasoning going on (just like every time Aunt Betsy cooks Thanksgiving dinner).

Surprising, considering Weihenstephan is one of my favorites of all time and I enjoy the style. Let’s get into it  Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing  This one takes a sweeter approach in the nose that I quite enjoy. I’m picking up on aromas of banana, sweet honey, bready malt, pear skin, bubblegum, and earthy wheat  While this tastes pretty good, I think it may be overly fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy wheat, banana, orange zest, doughy malt, and clove. The swallow brings notes of banana, raisin, bubblegum, earthy wheat, bready malt, pear skin, and light herbal hops  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer.

Lightly hazy dark straw color with a rocky white head that persists. Cereal bready and crackery maltiness with hints of floral hops and a spicy earthy yeast character.","  rDev Pours firmly-hazed medium-gold trending darker. The head is surprisingly limited, but retains extremely well. Decent lacing.   Sweet banana, spicy clove, and tart wheat all are present and well-balanced on the nose.   Sweet bready malts on the tip of the tongue with very pronounced esters manifesting in banana and bubble gum. The clove is nearly absent here, and the wheat that was so present on the nose is also pretty restrained. As a result, it skews a little sweet.  Medium-light bodied. Spicy yeast is really present as a  feel  more than a flavor, and uniquely so, lending excellent drinkability.  A little sweeter and heavier than the best of the style, this brew is nevertheless a good representation. And it has some unique spicy character that helps set it apart from others.","  rDev  Best by September 2021 ; drank 6/15/21 @ the Yarchives.   Cloudy dark orange appearance.

Pours a moderately hazy, medium golden amber with a fine, two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of wheat, light pear, banana and a touch of lemon. Flavor is dry wheat malt, lemon, banana and clove, fading a bit into a grainy wheat finish with a little residual citrus. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. A classic hefeweizen profile with a little more fruit notes than others and a very nice, silkier than normal mouth feel despite solid carbonation. The flavor starts strong, but fades a little into the finish, but leaves a pleasant wheaty aftertaste. Classic and nicely made from an ancient brewery. This bottle labelled differently from photo and alternate in description:  Hefe-Weizen Munich Wheat Beer , but is most likely the same weizen as this one.","  rDev From the bottom of the can:  09.21.2021 3 09.21.2020 D   The can states that this is a  Hefe-Weizen Munich Wheat Beer   Appearance: The body is an orange-gold color that is very hazy. It is nearly opaque but very stretched out and fuzzy shadows are visible through the hazy body. There is a lot of visible carbonation. The head is very large, even when care is taken while pouring. The head has a massive cloud-like appearance with a surface that looks like whipped cream. Head retention is fantastic and it leaves great lacing on the glass.  Aroma: There are aromas of lemon and white pepper with a bit of bay leaf. A mellow hint of clove comes through. After a while an interesting tortilla aroma was coming through.  Taste: Up front there is a light banana flavor mixed with a hint of clove. As it passes towards the middle of the tongue a light cream of wheat character comes through with a hint of vanilla. A very light yeast flavor is present which gives the beer a very light dough flavor. Towards the back of the mouth there is a light herbal flavor which tastes a bit like bay leaf, and at times a slightly astringent cedar wood.  Mouthfeel: It is medium-full bodied with a nice thick presence on the tongue. There is only a very mild bitterness on the back corners of the tongue in the aftertaste. It is very easy to drink and it is refreshing.  Overall: It is a very rewarding and uplifting beer to drink with a fantastic appearance, a pleasant aroma, and an enjoyable flavor profile. The beer has a nice broad palette of characters that it delivers to the senses, and that is what makes it so enjoyable. All these characters are brought to the senses very elegantly and delicately. It's hard to tell exactly, but judging by the two dates on the can it looks like I am consuming it at the mid-point between the two (canning date and expiration?). As an import beer, in a can specifically, I would recommend it at least at the 6 month or half-way point listed on the can. I would definitely drink this again.","  rDev L: hazy, orangy, good lacing  S: slight banana notes T: I get the standard, banana, clove, little bubblegum, a little acidic F: good mouthfeel  O: not my favorite Hefeweizen, but it’s to style","  rDev 330ml bottle supplied by Simone.. walking the dog park  No look, brown bag.

In fact, beer experts call it a masterpiece. In developing this beer, the Paulaner brewmasters have perfected a unique technique with “yeast suspension,” resulting in a uniform, slightly cloudy appearance, consistent quality, and perfect taste.  Appearance - Pours a cloudy gold with five fingers of frothy moussy white head.  Smell - noble earthy and leafy hops, bubblegum aromas, clove, pepper, banana, bready and grainy malts, and earthy yeast.  Taste - noble earthy and leafy hops upfront. The bubblegum aromas, clove, pepper, and banana follow suit and are nicely balanced. The bready/grainy malts and earthy yeast round out the brew.   Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering.   Overall - A pleasant hefe from the true source of wheat beers.

S: Overpowering with charred malts, cocoa, and espresso.  T/F: Rich and decadent... charred grains mixing nicely with the bitterness of the espresso. Some sweetness as well with cocoa and chicory. Vanilla and wood character from the oak. Thick, hearty, and moderately carbonated. Finish is bitter Italian roast.  O: A top notch espresso oak aged Imperial Stout. A powerhouse of a sipper. Fantastic beer.","  rDev Poured from a bottle dated Feb. 10, 2016. The beer pours black with a huge, thick, foamy tan head that coated the glass in lacing.  The smell is dominated by coffee, but I'm also getting some bourbon, which may just be the wood chips and dark malts. There is also chocolate on the nose.  The taste is also dominated by coffee, but there is a nice dark, bittersweet chocolate and dark malt flavor that balances very well. There is a lingering, bitter coffee afteraste.  The mouthfeel is smooth like velvet and reasonably thick.  Overall a great beer. The afteraste is a bit like burnt espresso after a while and becomes a little much, but the overall look and taste are great.","  rDev Growler into pint glass. Pours an opaque black with a big, durable dark-tan head. Initial impression is bitter dark chocolate, strong coffee and oak, plus a pretty evident alcohol burn. Pretty smooth, though. Mouthfeel is medium - I'd prefer if it were a little thicker. Carbonation is medium - could be a little lighter, for the style. Finish is lighter than I'd expect, dry, and expresso-bitter. This is definitely not a sweet liqueur-type stout. It makes you sit up and take notice.","  Enjoying a 12oz snifter pour at the Nashua Garden during Happy Hour.   It's dark and thick like sludge, with a creamy layer of mocha colored foam covering the surface. Lacing is exquisite, with nice stick all over. Has a great mix of mocha, espresso, vanilla and dark choco in the nose. Body is more than medium though surprisingly not real full or chewy. Still very smooth though.   Taste is superb, with more roasty coffee, bitter dark choco, espresso and hints of dark fruit. Has some earthy, tobacco notes and a decent amount of florality in the finish. Quite tasty; would love to try this side-by-side with the standard Yeti.

Fully black, the beer has a chocolate-milk colored head. Lots of lace. The aroma is intense....heavy roast, alcohol, earthy-spicy hops. The taste is warm...almost hot...with coffee and lots of bitterness. Wood is notable as well, and lots of warmth. Full in body, and with a lingering bitterness. Good, but not extraordinary.","  rDev ** 12/31/2014 Really nice. All Yeti i’ve had are awesome. Aroma is dark roast coffee. Very peaty. Appearance is dark black. Foamy brown head. Like carmelizing sugar. Taste is bitter chocolate. Feel is suprisinglt light and airy. Good carbonation for a thick beer. Velvety smooth. Only knock is maybe a touch too bitter in the aftertaste from the espresso, but other than that, perfect.  ** 12/31/2016 22 oz Bottle to snifter. Bottle dated 01/08/15.  At almost 2 years this is still awesome. Go Yeti.   **","  rDev Pours a very dark brown with a half inch, well retained dark tan head that left very nice lacing. Smells of coffee, malt, chocolate and just a hint of oak. Tastes of mildly bitter espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of oak and some sweet caramel notes. Full bodied, lightly carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel. Very good Imperial Stout.","  rDev This beer pours a deep motor-oil black with a large mahogany colored head. The The aroma starts with very dark chocolate, maple syrup, and lots of brown sugar, accompanied by some scorched caramel and vanilla. The flavor is rich and roasty, with chocolate and vanilla most prominent to start, followed by big notes of brown sugar and burnt caramel, and then the coffee comes through very powerfully at the end, including some nice tingly acidity from the coffee beans. The mouthfeel is fairly full, but cut through by biting, sharp small bubble carbonation. Overall this is a hell of a beer - not my favorite yeti variant, but a damn nice way to start my Sunday.","  rDev Pours jet black with a thick oily appearance. Thin, one finger brown head quickly dissipates leaving some spotty lacing on the glass and a thin tan film around the outside of the beer.   Smell has aromas of roasted espresso beans, roasted malts, and dark chocolate. Undertones of vanilla and oak.  Taste has notes of roasted espresso and dark chocolate up front. Nice roasted malt character throughout with a definite noticeable bitterness from the hops. Aftertaste is a pleasantly mellow cocoa and espresso blend. Overarching that there is a mild undertone of vanilla and oak. The oak is slightly harsh, but the vanilla is very nice.   Feel is very nice for a stout. Mild carbonation, decently smooth, drinkable.  Overall a very good stout, probably my least favorite of the Yeti series, but still very good.","  rDev Pours black with a medium-thick foamy dark caramel head. Fair retention with good lacing left behind at the top of the glass, but none later. Picking up roasted malts, with hints of espresso and oak in the aroma. Taste is roasted malts throughout, with sweet espresso notes. Sweet as in sugary. Feel is medium-thick, with some mouth coating ability. Overall, a pleasant imperial stout, but a bit on the sweet side so be wary. Otherwise, it's a pleasant sipper/drinker.   Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev Growler poured into a pint glass A: Pitch black with a 1+ finger head S: Espresso, dark chocolate, a bit of cream T: Coffee, cocoa but far more bitter than it needs to be M: Full bodied, very very bitter O: I guess I need to try this as it's bottled... I'll update my review if it's better. I've enjoyed the other GD Yetis I've had but this is so overwhelmingly bitter any positive notes that are there are hidden","  rDev Exactly what a stout is suppose to look like. Toasty malt slight coffee, not much scent. Strong boozy espresso taste. Medium body light carbonation, smooth and yummy. Incredible beer!","  rDev Black in color with an inch of tightly packed brown head resting on top. The aroma is intensely dark espresso, roasted barley, and dark chocolate. I taste espresso, dark chocolate, and dark roasted barley. The mouth is viscous, thick, and chewy. Bottled 12/14.","  rDev So dark, really enticing and rich hues of black with a dark mocha head lightening at a gradient.  Smell is so oaky and woody, but in a nice, dry, fresh sort of way, almost like cedar but not quite. Then comes really roasty dark malts, and Raisinettes.  Taste is a bunch of dry oak. Again it doesn't fall into the trap of seeming wet or soaked, stale or chewy, it's quite nice, with chocolate rounding and softening it. Even the coffee is woody and roasty. This beer is so expressive.  Full body, frothy, and dry.","  rDev A dark brown pour. Aroma is lots of coffee, or espresso, or whatever, but it wasn't like my favorite kind.   That coffee does dominate pretty much everything in the beer. Its a solid beer and stuff. Kind of a one trick pony. Would prefer if this was available in a 12oz format, the price structure is a lil much in the 22oz bomber.","  rDev Bottle dated 12/2014: Beer looks amazing, black with deep, dark tan head. The head sits atop the beer for a long time, settling into a foamy covering. Some legs on a swirl, and decent lacing after a few sips.  Given age, not expecting much coffee, but did get some initially. After sitting a little, a dark bitter roasted malt comes on more, with a light and growing oak scent, which might also be bringing some vanilla.  Taste is not big on the coffee (again, age?), but is true to the nose. Almost charred wood roastiness. A bit of astringency up front, strong black coffee notes eventually come out from underneath later in the taste. Decently thick in body and feel, and warmth brings about some smoothness.  The oak played more in this older bottle as a distinguishing feature over the coffee. So this pour seems similar to what I recall the regular Yeti to be, perhaps a bit deeper in coffee roasted notes, but not really as I expected. Need to try fresher bottle, for sure.","  rDev Bottled 1/2/14. Pours dark as night with significant head, dissipates fairly quickly. Coffee influence is still present albeit perhaps a bit too bitter for me at this stage. The barrel presence is clear at this stage. I'd like it to be a bit more chewy / viscious but I'm so used to the extremely high ABV stouts I have to adjust expectations accordingly for 9.5%. Overall, a pleasing offering and I'm sure I would rate this one higher if I had a fresher bottle!","  rDev 22 oz bottle purchased by a friend of mine who was generous enough to split it with me. Opaque, jet black pour with a small brown head. Coffee and roasted malts in the aroma. Bitter, but smooth, coffee flavor and some dark chocolate. Medium to full bodied but not heavy. If coffee is your thing, this is for you. A very well made imperial stout with big, roasty flavors.","  rDev Label info: BOTTLED ON JAN 08, 2015  Ink black body; thick, sticky, light brown colored head; lacing and clumps of foam on the glass. Deep, rich aroma of charred grains and wet coffee grounds; cocoa nibs; hint of vanilla. Thick, rich, velvety mouthfeel; gently sweet sugary feel with an offsetting bit of wood and bitter dryness.  Oh, yeah! Take a big bite of this one and enjoy the thick, chewy richness that oozes dark grain and coffee-like flavors throughout the taste and feel experience. The oak aging adds a really nice roundness and softness to the coffee and dark grain sharpness and bitterness. Big, bad, and extremely delightful...","  rDev On tap at Great Divide. Looks like any other Yeti. Aroma is a touch of espresso and stout. Flavor is burnt, really not good at all because of the strong burnt flavors in the finish. I would not buy this and I'm glad I only paid for a sample.","  rDev Bottled 2/4/15, served at 40 degrees into snifter Aroma of coffee Head large (5 cm, aggressive pour), dark brown, frothy, diminishing to 5 mm ring and broken layer Lacing excellent – complete coverage with tiny bubbles and a few small ones Body dark brown/black, opaque Flavor is very much coffee, not too bitter, with just a hint of vanillin from the oak.

Aroma: Ah! Citrus and pine aplenty. Gorgeous. A little tropical fruit, melon and pineapple in this nose. Orange and lime, too. Ah, I say again.  Taste: Boom! Just what we want from an IPA, but creamy and smooth and just delightful. Bittersweet notes blast the palate, followed by malty sweetness. None too caustic, this IPA, it's smooth and palatable as can be.  I peeked at the label. Maple syrup? Not getting that yet. Huh.  Hop bitterness is restrained, but enjoyable. Delicious. Tasty. I'm loving it. I'm liking this so much, it's time to find out more about it. Okay, so…. A bottle conditioned India Pale Ale with maple syrup.  7.5% ABV. There are some situations when 90 is too much. There are other situations when 60 is too little. There are many situations when 75 is just right. Bottle-conditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dry-hopped out the bejeezum boards. ","  rDev 12oz bottle. Unfortunately I did not check the bottling date, which is '10/29/19', which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. I picked this up out of the store's cooler, and didn't think I needed to date check. Anyways . . .  Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing. Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background. Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination. Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation. I will try to try this again with a younger bottling date, but this is still a very good hoppy, but sweet, concoction.","  rDev I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf at a beer store in LaCrosse, WI whilst there to move my daughter into school. The beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent was mild hop notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with smooth citrus hop presence and a tangerine finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer.","  rDev 1/11/20...pours medium copper with a light ring of white foam. Oaky nose, hints of sour. Woody. Flavors if grape, oak, and maple sweetness.

Interesting and quite good.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) into a Captain Lawrence muffin top pint; bottled 10/4/19. A: Pours a hazy, orange amber color with ochre highlights, a one to two finger, orange meringue colored head, full finger retention, and foamy, sticky, and persistent lacing. S: Aromas of caramel, pink grapefruit to orange, and pine in glorious balance. T: Sweet. Flavors follow the nose, but seems complex in its simplicity. Solid, but not overpowering, i.e balanced bitterness. M: Medium bodied with very robust carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. O: I thought it was remarkable similar to the 90 minutes, which means in was just delicious. Incredibly well concocted and executed beer.","  rDev Dogfish Head Craft Brewery  75 Minute IPA  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle,  BOTTLED ON 10/04/19 1347  and sampled on 01/25/20 $2.99 @ Total Wine &amp; More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy golden-orange body beneath a full head of off-white foam. The head retention appears to be pretty good. The aroma is grainy/malty with just a touch of maple syrup, and citrusy, piney, and floral with what I'm guessing are Cascades and/or some other  C hops . Hehe, I just looked at the label and it reads  off-centered art series FEATURING DAN STILES  - he's a friend of mine. Moving on, the flavor is fuller than the aroma might lead you to believe but it's pretty much the same. It's grainy, bready, and a little honeyish and sweet on the front of the tongue, but the hops and maple syrup immediately step in and transform it. The hops are gently citrusy, leafy, herbal, piney, and spicy. The leafy and herbal qualities enhance the malt &amp; maple syrup while the citrus, pine, and spice lend it contrast and an additional balance beyond the bitterness that's there. It's medium-full in the mouth with a delicate bristle of carbonation before warming to become smooth and creamy. It's an interesting beer. It's pretty big (how strong is it? 7.5%) and a bit sweet but it's completely balanced. It transitions from malty to malty &amp; hoppy, and then finishes drier but not too bitter with just a spritz of alcohol helping out the hops. I drank that REAL quick and I certainly didn't intend to. I've got just a swig and small sip left. The only thing that's let me down ever so slightly is that the lacing wasn't better. It still scores a 4.25 out of 5 though! Review #6,921","  rDev Dogfish Head 75 Minute IPA, 7.5% ABV. Pours orange with a 2-finger off-white head that left heavy foam lacing. Nose is malt, flowers, sweet maple and melon. Taste is malt, maple, light citrus, moderate to heavy bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall excellent.","  rDev L:. Pours a Amber red with a small white head and thick lacing around the glass   S:. Cracker malt, grass, and floral notes, notes of maple and sweetness.  T:. Cracker malt, floral and nutty hops, notes of sweet maple.  F:. Smooth velvety mouthfeel, bigger body.  O:. This is a interesting different IPA.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a tulip.  L: Very lightly hazy (by today's IPA standards, at least) orange-amber body under a 3/4  head of off-white foam. Good retention and thick lace. Quite nice indeed.  S: Piney, resinous hops are front and center. Caramel-drizzled grapefruit pith as it warms. Simple, direct, and enticing.  T: Balance of sweet malt and bitter hops up front, with candied citrus being the dominant flavor. Maybe a hint of maple, but I doubt I'd have recognized it if it weren't listed on the label. Solid resinous bitterness on the finish - crazy bitter by today's standards, but it works well. Really tasty old-school IPA.  F: Soft, well-carbonated medium body. Excellent.  O: Thoroughly enjoyable beer. Better than either 60 or 90 for my palate, although the latter will always have a dear place in my heart as a gateway to hops over a decade ago.  Beers of Fame tick 182/250. Cheers!","  rDev Bottled 9/26/19  Pours a hazy amber with a small white head with some nice lacing  A mild hop aroma meets the nose, not unlike the 90 minute, it's just toned down. The maple comes through less than I had hoped  The taste brings the maple forward a bit in the finish, a nice sugary vibe. Otherwise it's a pretty standard, well balanced IPA  Medium in feel with fairly good carbonation, a soft and dry finish  I wish I had found this a bit sooner so it would've been fresher, but still not bad","  rDev Six pack copped from Kings in Morristown. Pours a golden, bronze hue with moderate frothing. Assertive aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Similar overall flavor profile. Recommended.","  rDev Bottle from Brewers Haven. Medium amber with thin creamy head. Aroma: oranges, caramel, fruity notes. Taste follows with some orange zest, sweet caramel, toffee, apples . Falls a bit flat at the finish, but finishes clean.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip...  Pours a fine looking amber/gold with plenty of haze. An initial two-finger foamy head gives way to a nice collar of lacing. An excellent appearance.  The aromas are somewhat subdued, but pleasant. Solid malt sweetness up front, but with good balance. Grassy, earthy, and citrusy hops arrive as well, with a hint of barrel and booze.  The flavor is definitely skewed a bit sweet, but not necessarily from the maple. The malts are solid and biscuity., with some graham cracker notes noticeable. There is a bit of a soapy/tingly aftertaste that distracts from the primary hop notes, which are solid but nothing remarkable. Typical grapefruit, pineapple, and resin hop flavors arrive with a touch of booze at the finish.  The mouthfeel is decent, if a bit flat on the carbonation side. Medium bodied, it isn't sticky, but isn't crisp either. It is, in fact, rather  moderate  in every aspect.   Overall, a solid IPA that, nevertheless, doesn't measure up to either of the brews ostensibly blended to arrive at this one.","  rDev Amber color, slightly hazy pour with a thin, short lived head and good carbonation. Excellent aroma typical for Dogfish Head. The taste is also excellent and I can tell it's a lighter version of the 90 Minute IPA from previous experience. It has a bit of sweetness that I love in an IPA. I can't tell it's maple syrup though. Very drinkable and smooth as silk. Overall another winner from the Fabulous Brewers at Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Finally saw a six pack and didn't hesitate to grab it. My local craft beer joint has it on tap and I'll confirm the taste consistency. Poured from a 12 ounce long neck 'Bottled On 11/01/18' into a Spiegelau IPA glass. IPA lovers should try their beer in this glass.","  rDev Pours a clear golden color with a thin fresh white cap. Smell has pine and citrus with caramel malts. Taste very malt driven sweet caramel malts mix with pine and citrus hops. .A soft mouth feel with some bittering hops,and alot of malts. nicely done IPA.","  rDev Copper with a light haze, moderate carbonation and a hint of a yellow head.  Smells of pine, caramel, citrus, and grapefruit zest.  Tastes of pine, caramel, grapefruit pith, wood glue, and creme brulee.  Medium, syrupy body with moderate, fire like carbonation.  Drinking in Redding, Jan 12th, 2019. Excellent IPA.","  rDev 12 oz bottle. Pours amber with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel malt and tropical fruit. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is long and dry. Very tasty brew.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  L - Medium copper color and clear. Streams of minuscule bubbles are constantly rising through the beer. Persistent, off-white head is made up of sheets of tiny bubbles mixed with clusters of large, oily-appearing ones.   S - Epic levels of hop aroma combining pine, grapefruit, and cat pee. At a lower level is bready malt and darker tones like graham cracker and maple syrup. Fruity yeast note. More depth of aroma than most IPAs.   T - The malt and hops flavors are more in balance than the aroma was, with sweet, bready malt hitting first, then being balanced and finally overcome just before the finish by grapefruit and pine hops. Finish then flips back to the malt, with an off-dry hint of bread and sweetness.  F - Medium body with low but velvety carbonation that is spritzy enough to lighten the mouthfeel. Super-strong hops bitterness. With all the other sensations going on, the 7.5% alcohol does not leave much impression (it is well-hidden).  O - I am impressed by this beer because it is not one-dimension-ally focused on hops like so many IPAs are. The flavors and aromas are hop-forward enough to satisfy any hop-head, but there is also a strong influence from malt and other ingredients that keeps it complex and interesting. Very nice!","  rDev Finally got to try what sits between 60- and 90-minutes...  I have to say, this definitely better than the 60-minute version, not as good as the 90, and it would be sorely unfair to compare it to the 120 - with all that, it's a solid to decent IPA. Pouring out of the bottle into the pint glass is a copperish colored liquid that seems to show a gradient - darker at the surface and lighter towards the bottom - making it one of the more unique IPAs I've ever witnessed. The smell is also unique as it is a very nice balance between the juiciness you expect from an IPA and that hop-forward scent we all come to expect. Mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with an astringent effect. The taste is where I place it better than a 60 but nowhere near in the class of a 90 - nonetheless, this is still something to be experienced.","  rDev L: deep gold color, white head, good lacing  S: earthy hops  T: some sweetness some malt balanced with some subtle hops  F: well balanced, a little boozy O: haven’t had this in years, it’s good, but I remember liking it more","  rDev Poured from an undated bottle, I assume this is a new version of 75 minute that is not bottle conditioned. This beer is a very slightly hazy golden brown color. a compact off-white head of about an inch initially, falls quickly to a thin ring that persists. Clings like mad to the glass.  The smell strikes me as a fairly tame west coast old school IPA. Some sweet caramel maltiness, citrus that seems tangerine and orange with a floral note, then pine resin. No maple.  The taste strikes me as a typical old school IPA with much less bitterness. Tangerine and orange, floral, all dipped in a pine tree. Grapefruit juice. There is very little bitterness, but plenty of resinous pine. As it warms, sweetness emerges, but no maple. It is more of a corn syrup sweetness. There is a spice that says cardamom to me. I have enjoyed all of the Minute beers from DFH, but this seems like it doesn't share the same gene pool.  The feel is initially light, but as I drink the beer a tingling sensation builds and there is a mineral chalkiness that would both be unpleasant if there were a few more ounces to drink.   Overall, this beer does not deliver what the brewer's description implies. Granted that with no bottle date I have no idea how old this beer was. My impression is that what I am not liking has nothing to do with age. This was an expensive beer that shows up here rarely...glad I tried it, but can't honestly recommend it. This one seems to fail to deliver what it is supposed to be.","  rDev I've had this from large format a few times in previous years and on tap once or twice, a great selection to put in 12 oz. Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is copper, transparent, head is off white with head fine to small bubbles, presents about 1 inch thick and then lingers very well with some lacing on the glass and a solid top.   Smell is light sweet malt, light toast, then grapefruit hops and light pine and earth.  Taste has more pronounced malt, subtle maple syrup, light toast, then hops come through with grapefruit rind, spruce and pine notes, earth and light spice or peppery note.  Mouthfeel is very balanced with hop bitterness, light sweet malt presence, and then a drying note.   Overall this is a brew that was once upon a time difficult to locate, but now is one where you can find at any DFH seller. It does seem to have changed a bit over the years but its difficult to state without notes. Either way, its still great and in the midst of malt/hoppy beers that I was there was more variety in this sub category.","  rDev DATE: December 26, 2018... OCCASION: watching The Office after visiting with my parents for Christmas... GLASSWARE: La Fin du Monde tulip... with a golden bronze boy, this sets its bubbles aswirl like a licking flame... its finger-thick white is resilient and creamy, steeped and clinging to the glass... strong resin, sweet maple syrup, lemon, floral hops, pine, cardamom, and toasted malts... a strong, bold nose pervades the glass... a smooth, creamy mouthfeel generates an extremely drinkable experience... its finish is reasonably lasting and mildly warming... a grainy mid-sip follows the downtuned frontal expression... the dank resin forms the basis for citrus, with lemon, pine, and cardamom meshing with strong, sweet malts.... the citrus in this wins, taking the practical, everyday glory of the 60-minute with the otherworldly phenomenon of the 90...","  rDev Poured from a 12oz can into a Trillium IPA glass.   Look is a slightly hazy orange with an offwhite head.   Aroma is old school herbal ipa with a ton of malt.   Taste is pretty muted. Lots of sweet biscuit malt with a touch of hops.","  rDev Light copper colored with a quarter inch of beige head. The aroma is of pine and a touch of light malt. I’m tasting plenty of pine, some light malt, and slightly sweet finish from the maple syrup. The mouth is pretty smooth and quaffable thanks to the maple syrup.","  rDev Pours a slightly hazy honey amber with a thick white head that dissipates fairly quickly but leaves nice lacing. Aroma is citrusy hop forward. Flavor is a bit sweet in front, citrus and honey with a nice little hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is medium bodied, a bit syrupy, but well carbonated. Overall a fabulous brew.","  rDev From the growler, it pours a slightly darker amber with a lovely light just off white head that slowly diminishes and leaves lacing. Citrusy in both the nose and mouth, with a solid malt base. Nice!!","  rDev On draft, Loosa Brews, AL.  Pours a deep golden yellow, slightly hazy. A full head of foam bubbles up, leaving medium lace that fades quickly, and with a thin ring of foam settling around the outside of the beer.  The nose is mostly sweet, malty but with a more distinct complexity of brown sugar and caramel. Subtle but present piney hops balance out the sweetness and give a good nose to this beer.  Again, sweet with that caramel and malt coming forward. Not in a “this isn’t fresh” way, just more of a malt-forward IPA as most of DFH’s “Minute” IPAs tend to be. In the back you get a re-emergence if lightly earthy, piney hops and sweet citrus peel. It’s well-balanced, and got a little of everything you’d want.  Velvety smooth, great mouthfeel for this IPA. Soft and smooth, lightly sticky, warm as it goes down.","  rDev 12oz bottle, tulip glass. Darker copper body, one and half finger frothy white head, fair retention, lots of lacing. Smell is caramel, touch of brown sugary sweetness, floral notes, a bit of orange marmalaze and citrus. Flavour is a smooth, balanced caramel, brown sugar, a bit of maple perhaps, floral notes, fairly sweet toffee and a combination of grapefruit throughout. It's a solidly hopped IPA, slightly sweeter but with a less malty, cereal presence, than the typical DFH IPA, e.g. 60 or 90 Minute. Basically, less barley, more maple and sugar, serves as the sweet background to balance out the hops.","  rDev This beer pours a rich, reddish amber with a good sized head. The aroma features notes of orange peel, pine, grass clippings, lavender, and tangerine. The flavor starts with a burt of tangerine and citrus blossom, followed by lavender, honey, maple sugar, then navel orange rind, cantaloupe, and dried pine. The mouthfeel is ful bodied with bold, fizzing carbonation. Overall this is a really tasty beer, and split the difference perfectly between 60 and 90 minute, managing to have the exuberance of flavor of 90 minute, with the tamer IPA and malt flavors of 60, with that unique bit of sweetness from the maple also present.","  rDev 12oz bottle. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of citrus, pine and toasted caramel. Nice bitter hop bite up front with some sweet caramel and toffee.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a tall glass. Bottled 10/23/18, so a month old.   Clear deep amber body. Medium white head which persists leaving good lacing.   A hoppy ,faintly floral aroma.   Hoppy, fruity, sweet taste, with a dry bitter finish. Quite tingly on the tongue. A little warm too.  Mouth is above medium, finish is dry and bitter-sweet  Overall, good drinkable ipa with good hoppiness and a sweet touch from the maple.","  rDev 12oz bottle, served in a tulip glass. Bottled on 10/05/18 L705.  Appearance: Bright amber-copper. Thin off white head. Some strands and islands of persistent lacing noted.   Smell: Orange, a bit of tropical fruit, just a bit of pine and grapefruit.   Taste: Nicely hoppy, mostly bitter citrus. There is some underlying bready malt, and a quick hit of maple as well. Finish is piney and lightly resinous.   Mouthfeel: Nicely thick, airy carbonation, a bit spicy and dry at the finish with some stickiness on the teeth.   Overall / Drinkability: I had to let this beer get quite warm before I could taste the maple, so it's quite subtle. Otherwise it reminds me of a mix between the 60 minute and 90 minute beers from DFH.

Dark copper-amber in color, it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. It's mildly aromatic, with solid earthy and malty notes. That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness. Not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion, it's there, just well balanced by a really good malt body.","  rDev 355 ml bottle, vintage 2015, in Nevada City. Amber to copper colour, large white head. Pleasant aroma of fresh hops, herbal and fruity notes. The flavour is also well hopped throughout, but the bitterness is not extreme for an IPA. A very decent and enjoyable beer.","  rDev 12oz bottled 9-15-20. Opened 11-14-20. 2 finger dense, off-white head. Excellent retention.  Deep amber-gold color IPA. Bright, with a bit of initial chill haze.  Big nose of pine resin, grapefruit, caramel, lemon, and a leafy/spicy hop character. Sticky. Cigar, pine, some citrus, earthy flavors.  The hop characters are dominated by earth and less by fruit and it works very well here.  Medium body, low-medium carbonation. Slick mouthfeel. Lengthy hop-fueled bitter finish. Delicious, I really appreciate the leafy/earthy aspect of this beer.  Very unique in relation to the IPA category readily available today. Outstanding.","  rDev -optically clear golden-amber bottle pour with a 1 cm foam cap and a fresh, yet earthy hop aroma.  The flavor is full with balanced malt and hop elements. The hop influence is not sharp, but is very full. It has SN Celebration aspects and is very much appreciated.","  rDev SN never disappoints. This is one of their best.  a) Copper dark body sporting dense head with huge lacing splash. Extra points for color hue.  s) Features a fresh sawn wood, cedar, pine, sharp, spicy, and citrus. t) Follow, with more wood shop, toast, rose, orange rind, delicate wood sap sweetness. Layered complexity.  f) Resiny, grassy, Yes clean and sharply bright.  o) Sum is greater than the parts too .","  rDev De Labirratorium. En copa Teku.

Herbal, resinosa y acaramelada, de una manera suave pero asertiva. Deja con ganas de mas","  rDev Clear amber gold color with good white cap and lacing.  Aroma of solid, clean malt with enticing hop high notes of sweet citrus and pine.  Taste of fresh bread and caramel malt with a solid hop punch. Malt has good and flavorful depth with remarkable staying power and hop influence is equally present with further notes of grapefruit, lemon zest and an herbal essence that just underscores hop richness. Good flavors with great complexity and balance.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  Overall it's a first rate expression.","  rDev On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY.  This one pours a clear golden amber color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.  This smells like bready malt, cedar, pine resin, earthy hops, pine, and grapefruit rind.  This is one earthy creature. It's quite malty, as IPAs go, but it works decently well here, as it's kind of a golden molasses cookie malt sweetness that plays off well against the highly resinous and almost cedar-esque hop bitterness. There's a touch of bitter grapefruit citrusiness, but that's not a big player here.  This is slightly creamy, and pretty crisp, with a great drinkability.  This sits firmly and proudly in the old-school IPA camp, and it's nice to revisit that sort of thing here and there. I liked this a lot.","  rDev Pours a dark amber/copper color with visible carbonation. A fluffy foamy head displays excellent retention. Aromas of pine and grass dominate, as well as bright citrus pith and a touch of berries. Taste opens sweet and fruity. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and berries amidst a firm malt backbone that features caramel, graham cracker and honey. Citrus pith flavors, in particular, dominate the early palate. However, an assertive bitterness begins to develop, and earthy hops flavors soon become the focal point. Flavors of grass, verbena and pine resin stand out.  Medium bodied with a soft and silky mouthfeel. Very smooth and fluffy with a relatively gentle carbonation. A truly tasty IPA that highlights leafy hops flavors and a nice malt balance.","  rDev I have been keeping an eye out for this one for years and it finally started showing up in local stores recently. Pours gorgeous, with a big off white head and lace with a balanced, citrus forward nose.   Very solid IPA. Not a ton of bells and whistles, but a dry, balanced hop flavor matching pine and citrus against biscuit and honey notes from the malt. Low on carbonation, and a smooth body. Really pleasant medium bitterness in the aftertaste. Worth the wait.","  rDev Pours a clear caramel color with a huge pillow a head that refuses to give up. Great lacing. Aroma is hop forward, pine and citrus. Flavor is caramel malt and finishes with a decidedly pine hop bite. Feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall a decent wet hop beer.","  rDev Had on tap at Lures Bar &amp; Grille. I hate to say it, but this comes across as a pretty standard IPA from Sierra Nevada. Very similar to Celebration, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't differentiate itself. Lots of pine with some citrus. It's a tasty beer but blends into the (Sierra Nevada) crowd.","  rDev 12oz bottled 9/28/18 (41 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6.7% ABV. The beer pours bright light to dark copper in color depending on lighting with sticky, prolific khaki head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is mild to medium with pine being the first thing along with floral, earthy &amp; citrus notes. The taste is toasted caramel with citrus and pine intermingled with an earthy medium bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Not sweet or cloying, however the oils keep it from finishing dry. Overall, very good. Really nice old school west coast IPA.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Hazy amber/copper pour with 2.5 fingers of fluffy white head. Great sticky lacing.  S: Dank and hoppy.. herbal and piney. Smells like a Sierra Nevada/West Coast IPA.  T/F: Rich and malty... caramel and bread balanced out by a dank piney hop profile. Mild citrus, but herbs and pine dominate. Resinous and nutty. Sweet and bitter.. light bodied and stick on the tongue.  O: A pretty awesome IPA from Sierra Nevada. Similar but different from some of their other IPA's. More malt forward... but big time bitterness to balance. Really enjoyed this one, even if it's probably an ooch past its best by.","  rDev Like Mike Trout batting in the bottom of the 9th, this thang is clutch. Sexy, delicate hops meet wonderful floral notes like a virgin picking Lillie’s by Moonlight.  Yep!","  rDev Had the chance to drink it fresh at Sierra Nevada in Asheville this past Wednesday, super tasty! Seems like the  wet hop  adds a distinctive edge to the taste, nice.","  rDev 12oz bottle, PKGD 09/21/17 Deep cooper colored ale with a frothy beige head that eventually settles into a foam. Pine and citrus with bready caramel malt for aroma. Flavors yield a bold sticky fresh hop presence with notes of pine resin, grapefruit &amp; orange zest, bread crust, toasty grain, caramel, and a bit of earthy herbal tea; along with Sierra Nevada's familiar house yeast. Fuller body, sticky and resinous hop oils coat the palate with pungent bitterness, finishing bitter and dry with pine lingering. It's been a long time since I had this. I remember it being good, but this is great!","  rDev Bottled on 9/21/17. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours amber with awesome clarity and transparency; huge chunky light khaki head that falls very slowly leaving great thick retention and sticky frothy lacing. The aromas are have hints of caramel and apple. It kind of smells like a  Red IPA . Malts are there. The flavors are very crisp. Hints of pine and fresh grass. Some citrus in the mix. More caramel. Nice hop bitterness. Malts are there, but the hop bitterness shines. Alcohol goes unnoticed for the most part although it finishes with a mild warmth. Mouthfeel is great. It's medium-bodied with active carbonation. It's very fluffy and smooth.   This is a pretty solid IPA. It has that classic Sierra Nevada craftsmanship. It's clean, crisp, refreshing and fun to drink.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, packaged 09/21/17... poured into a shaker - unfortunately no better glass available where I am at this time)  L: near crystal-clear, cedar-amber liquid; inch-high stand of doughy, creme-colored foam - looks lovely overall... retains a sloppy cap and laces like a champ  S: raisin, cannabis, tobacco... burlap, dried berry... no overt alcohol scent and the malt has a slight toasty, dark (bone dry) caramel note, but is otherwise rather clipped and mellow... the variety of oily green aromas is quite intriguing... perfumy, earthy, musky - lovely, but I'm not getting much potency for some reason  T: oh wow... vaguely exotic spice; fresh or slightly air-dried earthy tea-leaf and herbal bitterness humming long into its dry finish... bit of lingering black pepper and white grape notes... hints of dried grapefruit, mango, and (I dare say) potpourri by the third and forth sips... the malt sits rather firmly below the hop swarm above, with subtle nutty/woody notes, adding dimension to the overall 'autumnal' or 'harvest' flavor image I'm seeing... not much underlying sweetness, but it's perfect and something I'd expect from SN anyway  F: biting on the palate but a thoroughly enlivening... the back-end dryness is superb and (again) something the younger breweries need to learn how to copy... the level and presence of alcohol is damn near perfect - the bitterness enhances its attack mildly, but everything altogether at the optimal levels - nothing overdone  O: really a fantastic beer - criminally under-hyped... lucky to have (finally) stumbled across it at the perfect time (usually I'm a couple months or more late in noticing it on shelves)... easy choice of a six-pack grab over the next week or two, and next year round this time","  rDev This beer pours a clear amber with a large head. The aroma features bright pine, resin, roast mango, and cannabis. The flavor is mostly full of very fresh pine, with background cannabis, grapefruit peel, cotton candy, and peppercorns.

Really nice throwback.","  rDev Pours golden colour, I don’t know why I was expecting a lighter colour. The head is hugely thick and fluffy. Leaves nice residue on my glass. The smell is a bit alcohol and a bit hops. The taste is all hops, not a hop-bomb, but quite hoppy nonetheless.

There are very light stone fruit elements.   Feel: It has a medium body with a bit of slickness.   Overall, the aromas and flavors weren't that strong.","  rDev 473 ml can served cold into a pint glass. LCBO purchase for around $3.65 CDN. Best before 01/15/21.  Appearance - Rich coppery golden color with good clarity and a mammoth three finger head. Great staying power and huge swaths of curtain lacing. Still a finger of head nearly 5 minutes after pouring.  Smell - Leafy hops with subtle bits of overripe pineapple and mango with a healthy dose of grapefruit and orange mixed in. Little bits of pine and some caramel at the end.  Taste - Initially some fruitiness of grapefruit and orange followed up with pine bitterness. For 50 IBU's this is quite bitter, but I like it in the old West Coast style so (even though this is from Georgia). Plenty of malt for a bready, doughy backbone. A kiss of caramel tops it all off.  Mouthfeel - Medium-heavy bodied, a little more sticky than some yet at the same time finishes super duper dry. Carbonation is middling but body has a soft character to it, a sense of weightlessness that is intriguing. Easy drinking.  Overall - I have a suspicion that this is not the freshest sample, yet still tastes really good and is quite enjoyable. Glad I picked up two and holds up against some of the fruitier local competition. For those in local (Ontario markets) Lone Pine by Sawdust City is a reasonable comparison.","  rDev 16 oz can from the LCBO; best before Jan 15 2021 and served slightly chilled.  Pours a hazy, translucent golden-orange colour, generating just over a finger of foamy, white head that dissipates within five minutes or so. A couple concentric rings of delicate lace have been left in its wake, as has a wide, creamy collar of froth; it's a good-looking IPA, I'll give it that. Lots of citrus on the nose - grapefruit in particular, but also some orange and lemon, alongside a few spicy, piney hop notes. There's also an undercurrent of wheaty, grainy pale malts with a touch of caramel.  A classic, no frills American IPA: grainy pale malts and a light caramelized sweetness comprise the backdrop, with grapefruit being the other prominent flavour of note. Minor hints of orange and stone fruit precede an increasingly piney, spicy and resiny back end with a fair amount of bitterness that lingers on into a spicy, resiny aftertaste. Medium-light in body, with moderately spritzy carbonation that provides a decent bite to this brew's smooth, slightly slick mouthfeel. Highly drinkable; several of these in a row shouldn't present a problem for most, if not all, hopheads.  Final Grade: 3.90, a B+. SweetWater's IPA is as traditional an example of this style as you'll find these days... not that one should expect anything else from a recipe that's been around for basically two decades. That kind of market staying power requires a high level of both quality and consistency, so kudos to these guys for creating a winner and sticking with it. Glad to finally have had the chance to try this craft beer legend.","  rDev A: Amber-gold. Nice clarity with chunky, mind-scaped lacing and a whipped cream foam head.  S: Clean pine, biscuit dough and grapefruit. Herbal spice; upside down pineapple lavender chiffon cake.  M: Med bodied. Med-high carb. A little creamy with mild butter-like sensation.   T: Tangerine zest bomboloncini. Light donut sweetness offset by citrus. Hazelnut yeast, melon rind, tropical mist, and pine dew. I enjoyed them especially for the price I found them ($1/btl with 2 months left on the expiration), so overall I'm quite satisfied.","  rDev (12 oz bottle, best if enjoyed by 10/28/19; purchased cold single... poured into Belhaven pub pint)  L: crystal-clear amber liquid, bit of sediment snuck in; 2-finger tall, tight, glorious frothy, aged-white foam stand... messy cap holds, with a few thick slashes of lace  S: heavy spiced orange, lemon, background hint of pine... bit of creamy, nutty yeast perhaps coloring it... doughy malt underbelly, smells lovely, beautiful roundness, depth; moderate-plus intensity... spicy floral edge slowly takes over  T: muddled orange and grapefruit, with the bite tamed on its spicy, acidic zing, supported by a cookie-dough-ish malt... aftertaste is slightly orange creamsicle, with a 'tropical' pithy bitterness lingering; capsicum spice slowly builds...   F: mildly-gooey, silky resins and sediment adrift within a relatively light body - its finish is brief, disappearing, while a mellow icing of said components lays in the front of the palate, and a sedate spicy warmth develops in the back  O: sort of like an enhanced, fortified version of their 420 pale? - bit more intensity and density to its hop package, but it doesn't seem to stray too far... I'm really digging the bottle-conditioned approach to their beers, however, both have tasted similar so far - need to take a sharp angle with the next I try (1548)","  rDev This one was really great. Crisp, refreshing, good hit of bitterness, perfect for a hot summer day spent grilling. Pours a darker golden-amber color with some nice fluffy white head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of great fruity zest hops - grapefruit, lemon, tangerine, pineapple, guava, orange - as well as some malt, vanilla, bread and floral hops at the end. Taste follows the nose, and there was a great balance between the sweeter malt backbone and the more bitter hoppiness, especially at the finish. Smooth, juicy, mild mouthfeel and great carbonation. Really well balanced and crisp, flavorful and enjoyable. An excellent summer beer!","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass Appearance- The beer pours a lightly hazed orange amber color with a one finger head of fluffy white foam. The head fades rather slowly over time to leave a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of a tropical fruit and tangerine smell mixed with some aromas of bread and a little bit of caramel. With a little bit of pine and a hint of light fruit aromas, one is left with a rather nice inviting aroma. Taste – The taste begins with a rather strong tropical fruit and tangerine taste with the tropical fruit being of a pineapple and mango nature. Upfront there is also a rather decent showing of a bready and caramel taste which remain steady throughout the taste. As the taste advances the sweeter flavors get slightly more intense al while some pine and grass come to the tongue. In the end with the all the flavors that are left, one is left with a nice fruity and decently mixed moderate hop taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the mix of fruit and hop the feel is good and makes for a flavorful easy drinker. Overall – A very tasty and easy drinking brew overall. Quite nice.","  rDev A - Medium copper gold color with a thin frothy layer of white head resting on top.  S - Citrus and sticky pine aroma.  T - Citrus and sticky pine from start to finish.

Solid bitterness... balanced.. a little bit of pineapple but mostly lemon/tangerine. Light and crisp.

Smell is initially dank hop with some onion, and some citrus peeks through eventually. The taste is much more grainy/bready up front; the hops more in line with pine and lemon, but very much still intact. The feel is medium heavy, somewhat smooth due to carb release on the pour and the sediment, but there is still a medium low level of carbonation to hold it together. Overall, a good solid IPA, will have to check into their dating to see how old this was."]},{"Name":"Negra Modelo","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/75/667/","Brewery":"Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V.","Style":"Lager - Munich Dunkel","Alcohol":5.40,"Score":77.0,"Comments":["  rDev 355 mL bottle from a six-pack bought at the LCBO; dated Nov 26 2021 and served barely chilled.

Pours a clear copper-amber colour with some effervescence; gathered atop is an inch of soapy, lumpy, cream-coloured head that dissipates within a couple of minutes. It leaves behind a messy coat of lacing, in addition to a sudsy collar and filmy cap - looks good to me. Subtle aroma of caramelized sugars, with toasted grains and bread; maybe a teensy bit of nuttiness and some metallicity.  It's a serviceable dark lager: a little sweet, but nothing unusual for the style. Toasted grains and lightly caramelized sugars, with doughy sweetness on the back end; just a hint of grassy, herbal hop bitterness on the back end for balance. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and nutty, fading within a moment or so. Medium-light in body, with moderate carbonation that gently prickles the tongue; smooth mouthfeel, not much bite. Fantastic drinkability - I don't tend to consume dark lagers in large quantities, but six of these around a campfire wouldn't present much of an obstacle.  Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. For a Euro-style dark lager, Negra Modelo is average at best - but I can't rightly claim that it was unpalatable, or that there was anything especially wrong with it. If anything, it's one of the better macro lagers I've had in recent years, and easily the best Mexican macro I've tried to date. The main downsides (at least here in Ontario) are the format and price point - in fact, my unwillingness to pay $14-16 for six bottles of macro lager is the biggest reason I've avoided reviewing this until now. I still don't think it's worth that, but the beer itself is nice enough, and worth the tick.","  rDev Bottle served with a lime at fiesta Mexican a in moab , utah  Notes: Negra Modelo, better known as  the cream of the beer , is a Munich-type beer with 5.3º of alcohol that offers a balanced flavor and a delicate aroma of dark malt, caramel and hops.  Today it occupies the first place in sales among dark beers in Mexico. This beer is accompanied by a bright deep amber color, which is adorned with abundant, white and compact foam.  Negra Modelo was introduced in Mexico in 1925 as the dark beer called Modelo, to begin its great tradition. In 2014 it changed its image to a more sophisticated bottle but with the same content.   Ingredients - Water, barley malt, non-malted cereals, hops  Goes well with Mexican food, malty , fresh clean,   Good beer","  rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Ayinger Celebrator pokal.   Crystal clear, caramel/burnt sienna gradient with a vague beige cap that quickly fizzles away. Vague lacing; poor retention.   Gentle malt in the nose, with a hint of grocery store wheat bread. Maybe some faint walnut and green apple as well.  Sweet yet clean palate entry, faint malt character, low bitterness, with a hint of soda water and caramel. Medium-dry finish. Tiny bit of chocolate and bread crust in the aftertaste, almost redeems things...  Not quite medium-bodied, reasonably low ABV, fairly high carbonation.  Substituting caramel malt, 6-row, 2-row, and rice for Munich malt, this isn't really a proper example of the style, but it is one of the better industrial lagers around.","  rDev Appearance: Clear amber, ok head but fades out quickly.  Smell: Bit of sweetness, toffee.  Taste: Mild sweetness, light fruit notes-fig and raisin. Light body, “ok”.  Overall: I used to have Negra Modelo a fair amount in the small town I lived in after college as it was the “fancy” beer at the decent restaurant in town.

Clear deep reddish amber body. The initial foamy tan head doesnt last long, becoming a thin ring and covering. No lacing.  Faint sweet lightly roasty malty aroma.  On tasting, it's on the sweet side. Does have that dunkel flavor, but very weak in the body.  Mouth between thin and medium, finish slightly dry and faintly roasty.  Overall, kind of a dunkel-lite feel. No bad, just not much substance.","  rDev Pours a light copper color with a small head.   Very mild aromas of brown bread, cereal grains, and roasted nuts.  Flavor is basically brown bread with some grape nuts. Maybe Raisin Bran. No hop presence. Not terrible. Inoffensive and drinkable.  Feel is very watery with minimal carbonation. Bad batch? Definitely not right for the style. Beer is fresh, as dated on the bottle.  Overall, this is a...drinkable beer, I guess. Not something I'd stick my nose up at if it was offered to me.

Otherwise, the flavors and aromas are inoffensive at worst.","  rDev Twenty-four lovely ounces of fluid poured from two squat brown twelve ounce bottles now temporarily reside in clear glass liter mug.

For a brown beer with an appealing aroma, the taste is on the mild side. Yeast and barley malt dominate the flavor, but there's enough hoppiness to keep it far from being too sweet. So much richer in taste and mouthfeel than ordinary lagers, but it's not up to the level of a good ale. Probably the best offering from this brewery, it can pair nicely with spicy foods. The glass lacing is even more modest than the head. This is a good example of the German-Austrian influence on Mexican brewing.","  rDev It's straight up good - I was expecting it to be fine, but it's actually better than I expected - a real nice rich brew with ample dark fruits and a smooth, light body-style... Moderately sweet, suggestive of dates and raisins and prunes - with a hint of hoppage and spice - something of a sipper for me, despite the low abv...","  rDev L:. Pours a copper amber color with a small white head and a little lacing.  S:. Notes of roasted malt, a touch of grain, and some sweet caramel.   T:. Roasted malt, caramel, a light hop presence, fairly solid, maybe a touch sweet.  F: lighter and easy drinking.  O:. It's nothing spectacular but it is fairly drinkable.","  rDev Negra Modelo pours a darker amber color, with a very small, but long lasting, and barely lacing head Aroma is light, malty, with a hint of pretzel. Flavor is light, a little watery, malty, sweeter, with hints of sourdough. Lighter and watery, but nice carbonation. Overall, light, but still nice flavors, and enjoyable.","  rDev Refreshing and easy to drink, this is a nice escape if you're over run with light American and Mexican style lagers lately. It's more of a 'when in Rome' type of beer. Can't complain too much, so grab a cold one and enjoy it.","  rDev After all these years reviewing beers I am finally reviewing one of the most popular imports around. Has more flavor than Corona or Modelo Especial. But with that said it lacks the depth of all malt Munich Dunkels. Dark copper color with very little head. No lacing. Slightly nutty and toasty aroma but not the largest aroma. Light body and nicely carbonated. I would not mind drinking this if this is the best thing on tap at a Mexican restaurant but not good enough to be put into any sort of rotation for casual drinking.","  rDev Pours an amber copper color with a dense creamy off-white foam head. Mild lightly dark malty taste, as it warms hints of chocolate, dark caramel, toast, molasses, almost cola, roasted nuts, dark dried fruit, and earthy herbal skunky floral hops.","  rDev Sixer of 12 fl oz bottles with gold foil neck wrappers that cover their pry-off crown caps nabbed at a convenience store in New Orleans, LA. I love their snubby design/form factor.   Medium-bodied lager with slow-roasted caramel malts brewed for a rich, smooth taste.  5.4% ABV. Best before: FEB 2021.  Deep amber malt, bread crust/toast, treacle, toasted malt, caramel. Balanced and light to medium-bodied, lending it high drinkability. Depth of flavour isn't great, but I can't knock its balance or build...this is well within style conventions. It does have a sort of amber malt syrup/extract flavour that flirts with artificiality. Maybe 6-row is one of the base malts?  I get hints of cherry as it comes to temperature.  I don't love it, but it's better than I expected coming in. A cut above the usual North American attempts at the style, but not a beer that holds a candle to traditional German expressions.  C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE","  rDev Poured from the classic bottle into a tulip.  Pours medium amber with a modest off white head. It quickly departs but leaves decent lacing.   Caramel malts and lightly toasted malts on the nose. Buttery.  The flavor follows the nose, with toffee, bread and toast, and butterscotch. Just a bit of grassy/earthy hops at the finish for balance.   The mouthfeel is medium in body, but fairly light given everything else going on. A fairly light amber brew. Well carbonated. Not crisp, really, but still very drinkable.  Macro-ish? Sure. But for the price and availability, this is a solid brew.","  rDev Bottle: Caramel brown body with a fair head and bits of lacing here and there. Nose is medium dry toast and some caramel with a hint of non-malt sweetness. Taste hits a little more on the caramel than the toasted notes, with a similar adjunct possibility up front. The opening is malty but not overly sweet, and that is backed by a slightly bitter mix of hops and toasted malt accentuated by a semi-dry finish. A little watery with some lightly biting carbonation, this is a pretty decent macro offering even if partially because it's a bit different than most of them.","  rDev Bottle. White head. Clear copper amber color.   Tastes more like a Vienna than a Munich dunkel. Caramel, toffee, biscuit. Earthy, zesty, grassy hops. Smooth, light, easy drinking. Solid for what it is.","  rDev This beer is really quite tasty, couldn't get much smell, but like most other basic Mexican brewed lagers I drank in Mexico, I found this one to be enjoyable and tasty and hit the spot at the end of a hot day, followed by a Marguarita. I felt the same about Dos Equis, Tecate and a few other lagers, as well as the others in the Grupo Modelo line. I'd probably get bored with them if I had to drink multiple in the same sitting, but they really hit the spot at the right time.","  rDev Unexpectedly, I found out I have not rated this beer. I thought I had rated this beer years ago. As I sit here to rate this beer, I am glad I am rating it now. I have gained a vast amount of knowledge about beer. In the past, I have rated beers subjectively and not the style. Negra Modelo a ubiquitous Mexican beer that almost everyone over 21 had drunk. I have drunk it several times but from a subjective perspective. Today I am going to rate it on its style with a touch of subjectivity. The beer has this gold foil, covering the cap that is not easy to remove. Instead of removing the foil, I just popped the top. Hopefully, none of that foil made its way in the beer. I served the beer in a pilsner glass because my Pokal glass has gone MIA. The beer is 44 degrees when poured. A creamy and frothy two finger head formed. The retention of the head is excellent, leaving a little bit of lacing on the glass. The head of the beer is a milky tan color. The beer's color is SRM 20, an amber brown with ruby hues. The clarity is brilliant. I am pleasantly surprised to see a beautiful appearance for a low rated beer.  The initial aromas I get from the beer are toffee, toasted malts, caramelized sugar, and earthiness. Digging further, I smell a touch of Maillard, an inkling of phenols, mustiness, bread crust, and nuttiness.   First, I taste nuttiness, bread crust, caramelized sugar, and earthiness. Moving the beer around, I get herbal, spicy phenols, dankness, Mailliard, toffee, a hint of chocolate, and roasted malts. The finishing flavors, I taste a hint of char, slight harsh roasted malts, and hint of floral.   The mouthfeel of the beer is soft, creamy, and carbonated.   The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and medium finish.   The beer does follow the guidelines for a Munich Dunkel to the letter. Is the beer amazing? No. Is the beer worthy of the rating it is getting? No. I feel this beer has gotten a bit of a bad rap. Yes, this beer is a lager. Too many have little understanding of the lager. I think the beer is worthy of a B rating. It would be a lot better fresher I can taste the age in the beer. I did enjoy the beer. Might drink a few more of these in the future.","  rDev Drinking this on tap at a Mexican restaurant poured into a pint glass. Appears dark amber. Smells malty, bready. Taste follows the nose with enough hoppiness for balance. Mouth feel is medium for the style  Overall, the best Mexican beer I could order because of no craft drafts. That being said, it's typically the best Mexican beer you could order in a Mexican restaurant. I had two while I was there. Goes great with Mexican food.","  rDev Simplicity. Simplicity. This beer to me is like taking a drink of water when you are thirsty - it does the damn job. Like waking up from a nightmare, you are aware and content. It’s like sucking on a lolly pop when you were a 4 year old. You don’t know shit, but you’re happy.","  rDev Continuing my series of reviewing beers I’ve had several times but never reviewed, Negra Modelo. This pours amber, with a lightly bready aroma. I used to love drinking it but now it veers on the overly malty and somewhat cloying side for my tastes these days. Still, you can do far worse.","  rDev 12oz brown bottle. Stamped on bottle neck is 'C229C119'. Distinctive bottle shape and label. Clean, ruby brown colored body. Slight off white head upon pouring. Left behind lacing likes to slide back down into the body. Aroma of toasted malt, with a touch of fruit and chocolate. Taste is toasted malt with an ending caramel note. Has a bit of pear apple flavor. Slight touch of chocolate. Thin mouth feel. Good carbonation. This beer has subtle aromas and flavors, but works well with spicier foods. Not a WOW beer but not much to complain about either.","  rDev Not a bad beer but a bit subdued for the style. Served at a party, but have had it many times with Mexican food. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  Could have used a bit more head. Weak smell, but some toasted malt smell and taste. Will order again, no doubt, at a Mexican restaurant.","  rDev Dark brown with Ruby tinge, topped with two fingers of beige head.  Smells of dark toasted malts, a hint of coffee, and that’s about it.   It tastes of dark toasted malts, and hints of toffee.  Very light body, with lots of carbonation.  I got this given to me from my friend from the Netherlands and I’m drinking it in Redding, June 10th 2019.","  rDev On tap at Rock n' Mexicana in Windham, NY.  This one pours a light caramel brown color, with a small head, and a lot of lacing.  This smells like lightly toasted malt, some sweet graininess, a touch of hops, and a slight fruitiness.  You could honestly do a lot worse than Negra Modelo. It's got an authentic maltiness to it, it's not too sweet, and it tastes very crisp and refreshing.   This is light bodied, a touch thin, with a great drinkability, and a higher level of carbonation.  This is honestly really not that bad. It pairs obviously quite well with Mexican food.","  rDev My Mexican restaurant standby - hits that easy drinking note and doesn't feel like crap big brewery lager. As a matter of fact and true to style it doesn’t taste at all like a Mexican beer with its dark caramel maltiness and relatively smooth mouthfeel."]},{"Name":"Samuel Adams Noble Pils","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35/54904/","Brewery":"Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams)","Style":"Pilsner - German","Alcohol":4.90,"Score":85.0,"Comments":["  rDev Pours hazy golden-straw color with a good fizzy white head that doesn't last long, not much lacing, light grassy and flowery aromas.

Flavor with notes of iced tea, a bit of bread and butter, quite noticeable floral and grassy-piney notes from noble hops (more floral), orange citrusy, lemon drops and honey. Dry and bitter aftertaste. What a nice surprise. This combination of 5 different noble hops resulted in a refreshing, crisp, assertive and clean Bohemian Pilsner.

Slightly darker than most pilsners I've had. The head is surprisingly small even for the semi-aggressive pour I gave it. The head is white and lasts for a few minutes before dying down into a thin ring, which leaves some spotty lacing. Smells very mineraly and metallic. Notes of green pepper, grass, lightly biscuity malt, perhaps a touch of orange peel. The flavor gives me minty and grassy hops upfront, along with notes of bell pepper. Leans slightly sweet with that toasty, biscuity malt, despite the initial hoppiness. There's a bit of apple, honey, and perhaps even strawberry. Not cloying by any means, though. It's still crisp and crushable. It does that have metallic flavor throughout, though, which I don't particularly care for. It's well-carbonated, and finishes lightly dry and just slightly bitter. Overall, a bit disappointing. It's not bad, but at this point I've had many examples of better pilsners.","  rDev The side of the label has a notch on  MAY  says:  FOR BREWERY-FRESH TASTE, ENJOY BEFORE MONTH NOTCHED   Appearance: The golden body has very good clarity. The beer has a medium-sized fluffy white head that has good retention and lacing.  Aroma: There is a bit of a cabbage scent to the beer.  Taste: There is a light bit of what tastes like corn mixed with some very faint soapy hop flavor. There isn't much flavor to the beer even for a Pilsner. The hop character is nearly absent which is a bit humorous given the image of a hop cone wearing a crown on the label.  Mouthfeel: Despite the lack of aroma or flavor to the beer the mouthfeel is pretty good. It's moderately crisp and it has decent carbonation.  Overall: The beer was really lacking in quality aroma. It just didn't have that classic noble hop scent that draws you into the beer. The flavor wasn't any better. I wouldn't recommend the beer or drink it again.","  rDev Brilliant golden hued with with vibrant carbonation bubbles erupting from the depths. There's a fingernail of creamy eggshell white on top.

Noble Pils Looks are clear and inviting.  Smell is more muddled, but my nose detects mostly sweetish malt (which I like.)  Taste comes on too strong with bitterness and Feels to dry for me to enjoy.  While it went well with a lemony pesto sauce over pasta, but I'm not having this again with mild foods.  Overall: one and done.  4/17/17: Had again with Mexican food.

Nose is grain, dry grass, and an dried green herbal to earthy bitterness. Has a very minor buttery note, though.  Taste has a little more grassy bitterness to it, but there's a nice buttery thick cracker malt note to balance this. This beer has a little body to it, not light. Medium carbonation could be a tad stronger to help, but I like it where it is.  This is kinda like a clean pale ale, balanced in bitterness and maltiness. It is more crisp that such an ale, however, and that is what makes it different and enjoyable to me.","  rDev Samuel Adams Noble Pils brewed by Boston Beer Company, with an ABV of 4.90% This Pils pours out a nice golden amber color with a fluffy white head. There is also some nice lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of Noble Pils is rich with earthly hops , grains and malts. Tgere is a slight sweetness to the smell of this brew. Nothing to overpowering so far. The look and smell of this brew are really inviting. Now for the taste, it is bold with hops and a nice clean smooth ending. You pick up on some nice grins and malts in the taste as well. This is fine smooth drinking Pils, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew goes down nice and smooth. The mouth feel of Samuel Adams Noble Pils is Bold, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing.

M - Good carbonation, slightly spiky, not quite as clean an exit, with slight build on the drying.  O - I am not a huge Pils fan, I'll admit.

A likable, approachable personality without a lot of depth. This is a thrust quenching crowd pleaser that is recognizably above average without making any demands, a plain vanilla pilsner as it were.

Some citrus elements as well, rather straight forward and solid.  Taste is hop dominant completely covering the malt which serves more as a carrier for the hops. I don't really notice the caramel elements mentioned in other reviews though there is something in the background that's counter balancing the hops. I say hops as plural supposing, perhaps inaccurately, that there are several varieties used. Maybe it's the way they're used. I do pick up what I can only describe as grapefruit peel in the aftertaste, also a long lingering essence of hops.  Good texture, solid and balanced.  Of course it's hoppy, that's rather the point. Not heavy palate whacking hops though, rather a strong hop presence from the beginning that builds to a crescendo somewhere past mid palate. I'm not getting the caramel sweetness that's been mentioned by others, perhaps it's in there but it eludes me. Right after the hops peak I notice the resinous grapefruit flavors. All in all there's a bunch of stuff going on in this brew and if my palate were less bitter sensitive I might spot more things directly rather than through a glass darkly.","  rDev Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Kettleborough Cider House glass.

The nose is of pine and citrus and for most part so is the taste. Lingering bitterness after every sip. A very enjoyable DIPA no doubt.","  rDev Pours a hazy golden color with a thin foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Malty aroma with citrus, caramel and slight piney hop. Really light on aroma. Bitter up front with some spicy hops and mild citrus on the end. It is a little dank. Smooth, silky taste with moderate carbonation. Peppery bitterness on aftertaste that persists. Good beer but not really what I was expecting. Maybe it was old.","  rDev Nice to me able to find this in MN. Best by  26April17  Earthy and pine aroma with a solid malt background. Hops push towards excess with a vegetal quality that I don't like, otherwise I like the hop presentation. More old school. Sticky white head over a golden amber cloudy body. The head is nice and dense.  Not quite a sticky body but a heavy body and fully carbonated.  Bittering is prominent but not excessive and it dries out nicely on long finish with a tongue sticking quality.  Hop taste resembles the aroma with a very earthy and pine presentation. But I also get the hoppy excess like plants decomposing. Funny, but I don't like that.  Overall this is okay, but in all honesty I'm glad I bought a single and not a 6-pack.","  rDev 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 5/4/2017. Pours fairly crystal clear deep gold/light amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, papaya, lemon, orange zest, light pepper, pine, honey, light caramel, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, papaya, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, light caramel, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, papaya, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/grainy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is an incredible DIPA! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","  rDev I can't see what all the fuss about this beer is all about!!! Looks great but very ordinary other aspects. Poured a clear golden/orange color with a big white head and thick bands of lacing on the glass. Head retention is excellent. Aroma is fairly weak, some mild grassy and piney hops. Didn't get much else out of it. Flavor is fairly average, piney and grassy hops, a little vegetable/onion (could they have used Summit hops which my taste buds hate?). The malt is the dry biscuity type. Mouthfeel isaverage, some bitterness and rich enough for the style. Nothing outstanding. Far from an outstanding beer!!!!","  rDev Golden yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short, bright foam with medium low retention. Medium high, intense, sharp citric hop aromas with low malt aroma. Medium bodied with medium low carbonation and an incredible creamy smooth feel through the middle to the end along with pleasant boozy warmth. Medium high, dank, citrus hop flavors followed by a medium high hop bitter bite through the middle. Citrus flavors and bitterness taper below low malt flavors to the end. Finished semi-dryly with citrus hop flavor and a lingering light bitterness. Fresh, bright, intense hop flavors with an incredible feel. A fabulous DIPA.","  rDev Pours a clear orange with two fingers of white head. Nice retention with tight lacing - at least at the start. Aroma is a blast of hops and notes. Citrus, orange, resin, and pine come through in a sticky, almost-juicy aroma. Very tasty and appetizing. Biscuit malts form a nice base, and help substantiate the aroma. Fruity, citrus, orange hops pop through the flavor profile first. After the peak of fruity, orange notes, resin and pine hop notes stick the beer to the palate for a hoppy, slightly-bitter decompression of flavor. Mouth feel is filling, slightly abrasive and grainy, with a medium-thick consistency and texture. It's more of an experience to drink, rather then something to pound by the pool side. Overall, a well rounded DIPA with lots and lots going on. It's really more of an experience to drink, rather then something to slam.   Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev Orange creamsicle. Booze. Sweet DIPA. I would like this a lot more in a single IPA version. Surprising how much the booze comes through in a relatively tame 8% ABV brew.","  rDev best by april 2017 so i assume this is pretty fresh.   pours fairly clear with a fluffy white head. super skunky aroma, in a good way. dank and resinous. very fresh aroma and i like it. hard to believe this is 8 percent abv as it is fairly easy drinking. well done brew by alpine.","  rDev Pours golden to a darker shade of yellow. Aroma smacks heavy of dry hopping, no shortage going on here. Piney.   Taste is a minor malt sweetness enveloped by a shit ton of hops despite not being excessively bitter. Hides the alcohol very well, doesn't get bogged down in malt or caramel. You could wade dangerously into sessioning this stuff territory."]},{"Name":"Porter","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/279/","Brewery":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","Style":"Porter - American","Alcohol":5.60,"Score":87.0,"Comments":["  rDev Oxblood with a thin ribbon of off white foam; cocoa powder, brown bread, and salted peanuts on the nose; salted caramel, brown toast, hazelnuts, chicory coffee, kola nut + slight licorice, light twiggy hopping to end; light, clean, salty, tightening bitterness.   3.75 3.75 3.75 4 4   Dec 30, ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old.  Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts.  There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout.  What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying.   A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile.   Lighter, fizzier, sweeter, nuttier, more balanced, less hoppy, cleaner, and more sessionable than Sierra Nevada Stout.","  rDev A truly pleasant classic right here. Surprisingly dark black beer with a moderate off white head. Smells vaguely sweet and grainy with a touch of coffee and a touch of cola.

A wonderfully flavorful brew and a simple joy to drink","  rDev Had this on draft 11/15/19 @ the Beer Temple.   A bit hoppy, but overall a well-crafted take on a classic style. Definitely a true American porter...I'd prefer it a bit maltier but this was very enjoyable.","  rDev If night time is the right time, then pouring Sierra Nevada Porter is mighty fine.

The appearance is a dark brown with a large tan colored head. The aroma is chocolate, roasted malt and some hops. The taste is fantastic, a great blend of roasted malt chocolate and hops.","  rDev 12oz bottled 5/13/18 (67 days ago) poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 5.6% ABV. The beer pours bright dark brown, with reddish light brown highlights and sticky chocolate tan colored head. The head recedes to a thin film and leaves a spotty wall of lacing. The aroma is malty chocolate and a hint of roast. The taste is dark chocolate malt, roast and the slightest amount of twang on the back end. There is a minimal amount of earthy hop in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, excellent. It's a shame this beer doesn't see better distribution. Recommended.","  rDev From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic micro pours a rugged and dark brownish black with a very nice head of off white foam that  settles to a thick ring, thin layer, and sports some nice sudsy lacing.  Nose of coffee, dark fruits, dark cocoa powder, and touches of char mingling with sweet dark malts. Flavors exceed the nose with presentation of a solid English/American style porter with cola and cocoa mixing  nicely with dark coffee and touches of raisin and char with wafting vanilla notes. Excellent mouth feel; medium full body, medium carbonation that is lively enough to make this an excellent session brew, and a rich  malt driven finish.  Overall, a SOLID porter from a great little brewery.  Cheers","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Bottled on 'PKGD 03/28/17 0543'. Clear, ruby brown colored body. One finger beige head settles to bubbly, thick cap. Scattered areas of lacing.  Aroma of dark roasted malt and sweet chocolate. Taste is that of a classic dark roast beer, darker roasted malts combined with coffee, with supporting hops. Bittersweet overall. Medium mouth feel. More to the dry side. Excellent beer for pairing with a wide range of food, including savory meat and cheeses.","  rDev ** 09/30/2012  Bottle to pint glass.  AROMA: Weak nose. (edit: probably just too cold; back in 2012 I never bothered to let a dark beer warm up). LOOK: Dark pour, frothy head AROMA: toasted, almost burnt malt, barley. Slight Tea flavor. feel: A touch flat…creamy finish.  OK, good porter.  **","  rDev Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a glass tumbler. Chestnut colored body with a ruby highlight or two. Fluffy light tan head that left plenty of sticky lacing. Dark roasted malts dominate the nose and palate, with some dried fruit and a bit of tartness on the finish. This is probably best enjoyed cold. The mouthfeel is medium-light, with lots of carbonation that makes the beer foam up in your mouth when it is warm. I could see this pairing well with German food and the like, but as a stand-alone sipper it comes up a bit short. YMMV.","  rDev Poured into a custom grip shaped glass: color is brown, lighter edges, head is light tan, head lingers with a thin top and lacing on the glass.   Smell is light toasted malt, hint of chocolate.  Taste is similar to the aroma: hint of chocolate, light toast, maybe some yeast and earthy hops.   Mouthfeel is moderate: carbonation is moderate, lingering flavor is lightly sweet with feint dryness.  Overall a very good, simple porter; the description eludes to homebrew porters which with its simplicity and flavor I can vouch that some of my own have had similar outcomes.","  rDev Poured to a tasting glass.  A: The body is dark but it's not very opaque as some coppery hues are visible when turned against the light. The ahead is beige having awesome retention. It's 1 finger thick. S: The aroma is simply of perfectly roasted malts and caramel malts. Nothing else. T: The taste starts off the roastiness of the caramel malts, providing a more black-ish hint to the flavour and then turning a bit more sweet due to the sweetness of the caramel malts. In the end, some clovey sweetness and no bitterness at all. Actually, and sadly, the end of this flavour is a bit empty. M: Body is low. Carbonation is low. Bitterness is non-existent. Sweetness is a bit high. Alcohol is strangely noticeable. O: Drinkable but not a very good beer.","  rDev Cola black color,medium carbonation. Aroma is roasted malt,coffee,and bitter chocolate. Taste mimics the aroma with roasted malt and bitter cocoa most prominent. Just a touch of bitterness rounds it off with a really clean finish. An excellent version of a porter which went well with food or just by itself","  rDev L: Black with a big off white head. Excellent retention and lacing.   S: A little bit of roasted grains, malted milk balls, caramel, milk chocolate and almond milk.  T: A little bit of cacao, milk chocolate, roasted grains, and milk. Lightly bitter with some lingering coffee notes.  F: Medium-minus, well-carbonated, light but smooth.  O: A decent porter. Worth trying!","  rDev Coffee black with burnt red edges and an off-white foam head.  Smell is smokey, verging on hammy, with wood, moderate roasted malt, pumpernickel, and some catty hops.  Taste is roasted coffee, cocoa, wood, with light lemon and pine.  Soft and frothy with light acid.  Very unique for the style, but for such a hop-focused brewery, this should be no surprise.","  rDev Sierra Nevada can't seem to make a beer that doesn't look impressive. This is one of those archetype west coast craft porters. Dark brown, full inch of tan head. Smells like the usual hallmarks of style, coffee, chocolate malts, burnt deep.  Taste, wow, Cascade hops and a nice bitterness backed up by a strong roasty presence. Not overly thick, these are fun in 12oz increments, no need for a Chicago pour here. Straightforward stuff, and quite the classic.","  rDev Dark and clear caramel colored beer with a tan head. The smell is toasted malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste is sweet and toasty with a nice malt flavor and coffee notes. A slightly bitter finish. Classic and tasty porter.","  rDev Overall, a wonderful porter. The aroma of roasted malts and rich chocolate wafts out from the dark ruby body capped by a two finger beige head. Toasted bread, roasted malts and chocolate are the backbone of this beer. Earthy hops show up towards the end, returning to a dry, roasted malt finish and after taste. The mouth feel is full and dry with a body at the high end of medium with moderate carbonation. Happy to have this on the shelves.","  rDev The West coast version of a porter and this felt pretty good sipping this on a cold evening. Warms the body and the chocolate and coffee aroma would make for a great breakfast. At 5.6%ABV this one won't hit you too hard. Cheers!","  rDev From Uvinum. In Teku glass. Good. More body than expected, probably because a good use of hops. Not a hoppy interpretation of the style however.","  rDev Roasted brown, filtered, with a solid beige head, which lasts pretty long. Sweet, roasted malts, bread and toffee. Smooth, oily mouthfeel, with a subtle freshness, due to the present carbonation. Malt defines this ale, its getting even more present in the end, with an upcoming burned toffee sweetness. Great balance between sweet and roast malt flavors. Subtle coffee notes add a pleasant complexity, which creates a warm, sweet impression on the palate. Taste doesn’t linger too long on the tongue, easy drinkable. Still, this beer leaves me satisfied, with an impression of a very well balanced porter.","  rDev Pours dark maroon with a creamy frothy light khaki colored head. Smells like roasted malts, burnt toast, chocolate, coffee, dark caramel, molasses, charred brown sugar, mild dark cherry fruit, with herbal earthy pine and woody grass. Tastes like charred roasty malts, burnt toast, chocolate, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, roasted coffee, mild dark cherry fruit, with some herbal pine and earthy woody grass. Feels light-medium bodied, creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall a nice porter.","  rDev Perhaps the last piece in the Porter puzzle comes from Sierra Nevada, a brewer I have long admired from afar in my home country of Oz-stralia. We know upfront that Sierra Nevada is well known for any beer with the words “pale” and “ale” in them, but how well do they approach the Porter style - with a slam-dunk like the equally-impressive-at-brewing-pale-ales Founders, or with a beer that is barely recognisable as a Porter like the example I just tried by Anchor? I suspect they’ll fall in between those two, but there is only one way to find out (aka ‘the fun part!’).  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Quite light, more like a hazed darkened Amber than the usual black/browns you would get from a Porter - that in itself is a worrying sign of things to come - with a 2 cm wispy off-white head that sticks around well. Way too light is the final verdict here. 6/10.  S: Aroma is definitely more in the Porter ball-park than Anchor’s offering - with a dusty chocolate, earthy coffee aroma, and some lingering coffee cherry notes. I scored the Anchor higher because I like molasses, and that had bags of it, whereas this aroma is more in the right direction it definitely is lacking some heft. 7/10.  T: The above aromas are present in the flavour (with some added camp-fire smokiness) however it never really lifts the game from the aroma and is most certainly lacking in the flavour department. To wit - I’ve had better Australian Porters/Stouts than this, and Australia is hardly a Mecca for Porters. 7/10.  M: Body is much better than the Anchor lot - with a mid to light, borderline medium body, light carbonation, eminently drinkable but not Founders smooth (not many beers are Founders smooth). 7/10.  D: Sierra Nevada’s least impressive beer? I can safely say “umm, sure, why not” I may be assassinated (beerlitically) for saying this but this is by far the worst SN brew I’ve had so far, however that isn’t saying too much as all their other brews have been so bloody brilliant, they just dropped the ball on this one as far as I’m concerned. I’m not overly disappointed though, there are plenty of awesome Porters out there and there’s little need for SN to fill this niche for me, as long as they keep up the standard they’ve been keeping with their Pale Ales and IPAs I will continue to be a happy man. 6/10.  Food match: Despite (or due to) being a watered-down version of a Porter this brew would work well at that most classic of backyard functions - the BBQ."]},{"Name":"Loose Cannon","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/898/25755/","Brewery":"Heavy Seas Beer","Style":"IPA - American","Alcohol":7.25,"Score":89.0,"Comments":["  rDev Loose Cannon has a thick, soapy, white head and a translucent, bubbly, orange appearance, with some glass lacing.

Hop heads should love it.","  rDev 12oz can witta date  Looks great, clear, ring of foam with good lace. Smell is light citrus and alcohol.

It's aight","  rDev 12 oz bottle, best by 5/13/20  I can't imagine this could be any more than 5 weeks old. Parish Teku Watching the Packers game (slaughter?)  Deep hazy golden color with a tall creamy fluffy head of 2 fingers, sticks around at 1.   Aroma is a hop soup of dank hop leaf and some bright fruits underneath that. Slight pineapple, slight grapefruit, and very slight mango.   Flavor brings a heavy bitterness with watery undertones of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon pith, slight orange pith, and other bitter citrus. Some caramel malt also creeps up.   Feel is hard and heavily carbonated, with a moderate alcohol warmth. Carbonated finish.   Overall not really my thing, I know how fresh this is and it already tastes like it's on the way out. Could be a good DIPA but only straight from the teat. I imagine this would be fast track to Barleywine status in as soon as 2 months.","  rDev 9-20-2019 I've shelled out doe for terrapins a few times before. They always seem to put out quality products and this is no exception.  It pours a deep golden, slightly hazy with nice fine bubbles. The aroma is not as prominent as I would have liked (for all the kinds of hops in it) but still very pleasant, hoppy and fresh smelling. The taste is a deep, somewhat malty IPA taste, with more varied and intense hop bittering. It works well. It is not a light or dry AIPA, like a New England - not at all. It's bitter-sweet and fairly unique from the variety of hops (versus quantity). A success.  Recommended.  3-6-2021 Got some of these and three less brews in a  survival pack.  I would have preferred a selection of even larger brews, but two are really wimpy. This was OK, though. One out of four.","  rDev From the bottom of the can, right on the rim:  BEST BY 11/05/2019 16:56 19245.24   Appearance: This beer is a medium-dark bronze with hints of golden-brown as the light shines through. The head is pure white, frothy, with a lumpy consistency. It has very good head formation, retention, and a nice frothy spiderweb of lacing. It is a very beautiful beer.  Aroma: There isn't much aroma going on here. It smells like a dusty bookshelf with a light peppering of caramel and some alcohol in the back.  Taste: There is some caramel up front, then a light bit of pine, and some wet wood and alcohol in the back.  Mouthfeel: It has a good bitterness, decent carbonation, and a medium-light body.  Overall: This beer goes to town on the hop varieties; around the rim it boasts  Chinook Simcoe™ Amarillo Cascade Centennial Warrior.  The hop presence is pretty low in this beer when it comes to the aroma and flavor. It had a decent bitterness but the beer leaves one wanting more flavor and aroma. It isn't a beer I am likely to pick up again and there are far too many, better, beers on the market for me to recommend it. I might try it again on tap.","  rDev A-Pours a nice amber color with a nice head and lacing A-Aroma has hop hints T-The taste follows the nose with a hop flavor M-A medium bodied very well carbonated beer O-A good IPA","  rDev Appearance - Pours pretty clear golden color with nice white head, decent retention. Nice lacing all around the glass.  Aroma - Citrus peel, solid malt aroma, grapefruit, orange, light yeast, big floral hop nose.  Taste - Taste is a light mixture of hops, citrus peel, malt and orange. The malt and citrus stick out the most just like in the nose. Really bitter finish.  Feel - medium bodied well carbonated slightly dry finish. Little hint of fingernail polish at the end.   Overall - About a middle of the road IPA, nothing off with it but nothing really stands out either.","  rDev Nicely done IPA but a little disappointing as I expected more based on the great reputation of this brewery. Nice yellow-amber color with some fluffy head and a little spotty lacing. Smells of fruity and floral hops. Tastes of more fruity, citrus hops than floral or herbal hops. Nice caramel, grain, biscuit and a malt backbone.

Nose is quite balanced, with a strong presence of sugary sweet toasted malt and a resinous and dank hop aroma. Flavor is similar; nice balance of malty sweetness and fruity hops. Smooth feel and body with a pleasant finish. This was pretty good and would definitely score better back in the day when the model IPA wasn’t OJ with hop dust and concentrate added.","  rDev 12 ounce can into tulip glass, best before 7/10/2018. Pours crystal clear golden amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts.

Aromas of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, pepper, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate bready malt notes; with solid strength.

Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, pepper, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and slightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7.3%. Overall this is a very nice IPA. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish, never aggressive. Old school IPA as expected. Classic C/Simcoe/Amarillo hops. Balanced juicy/dank hop complexity; nice bready Munich/Victory malt backbone, with mild residual sweetness. A very enjoyable offering and well made style example.","  rDev 12oz can bb 6/18/18 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.3% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey in color with sticky off white head. The head recedes to a cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is semisweet caramel and a touch of hops. The taste is more semisweet caramel with a tea-like hop addition. There is caramel, then green tea, then a dry bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and very dry in the finish. Overall, good but dated. I've noticed this quality in other southern IPAs and I'm not a fan. Thin, super dry with the hops making a tea like presence. It's ok drinking and well made, just not my preference.","  rDev Poured from a 12 oz can into a Dogfish Head tulip  L: Clear golden orange pour with 2 fingers of frothy white head. Nice lacing around the glass.  S: Bready malts and citrusy hops. Sweet and earthy.  T/F: Grains and light malts form the backbone... mild sweetness that is quickly cut off by bitter hops. Resinous... pine and citrus. Slightly herbal with a bit of spice. Medium to light in body. The finish is bittersweet citrus.  O: A solid IPA... probably more of a DIPA by ABV. Not elite by any means, but with good flavor and bitterness. Goes down easy. I'd have it again. Probably wouldn't seek it out.","  rDev Terrapin Hopsecutioner brewed by Terrapin Beer Company, with an ABV of 7.30% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice thick white head. There is a nice amount of lacing to this IPA , it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, earthy grains and malts. Lot of earthy tones in the smell of this brew. So far this is one inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is bold with hop bitterness. This American IPA has a bit of a hop bit to it, if you are a fan of hops this is an IPA for you. You also pick up on some earthy grains and malts in the taste, however they are mild compared to the hops. The body of Terrapin Hopsecutioner is a medium to heavy, to heavy. This brew , does go down nice, and would go nice with a dinner. It is hard to pick up on the 7.30% ABV in this brew. There is nothing to overwhelming about Terrapin Hopsecutioner, as long as you are a fan of hops. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold, Rich, Clean and Refreshing. I would look this brew up again if I was in the mood for a bold Hoppy brew. Overall I'm Terrapin Hopsecutioner a 4 out of 5. Terrapin Beer Company, did a nice job with this American IPA.","  rDev Picked up a single at the Hilton Head Island, SC Kroger on Sunday for $1.49. Best by 9-23-17.  Beer poured golden orange with a decent white head that is retaining some lacing.  Nose is a nice combo of citrus and tropical fruits.  Taste is really well balanced between the ample caramel and pale malts and the citrus and mango hops. Finish has a touch of grapefruit pith.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth.  Overall a very enjoyable IPA that i am glad i got to enjoy!","  rDev Medium gold color a bit richer that other highly hopped Terrapin beers I've tried. White cap with good lacing.  Malt rich aroma quickly followed by light pine and citrus.  Flavor is malt forward and the brew is all the better for it. It's good to see a hop centric beer with enough malt to balance things out. Mid palate the malt slyly steps aside while citrus and pine hops take center stage. All these elements then blend into harmony and the melody carries to the finish. Very slight piney bitterness in the aftertaste in a refreshing way.  Solid, rounded medium-full texture balanced by carbonation.  I was expecting another bright hop brew in line with others I've had from Terrapin and this was a pleasant surprise. Enough malt to actually matter standing up to but not over shadowing the hops. Very nicely blended complex flavors that reveal more levels of subtlety and surprise as the glass is emptied. Some of the other Terrapin IPAs I can drink interchangeably but this one is a standout.","  rDev Hazy dark orange with a large white uniform head.  Smell is orange rind, dank sticky pine, astingent Brillo and grass.

A strong steady stream has a pretty good lasting presence of effervesce.   S: Sweetened grapefruit pulp is juicy and semi-tart along with wet grassy hop notes. Dried peaches and apricot fruit has side notes of orange-citrus upon the close with some mixed fruit presence. Good strength overall, complexity is only moderate.

Small carbonation factor that really does not make nor break it either way.   O: Overall 3 Floyds makes some trueley outstanding beers that stand above the rest, unfortunately this is a mere placeholder in terms of the brewery's other accords. While solid in strength with a demanding flowery hop bitterness, I just did not find it contained a lot of complexity or malt attributes. The blunt force of hops most likely drowned out any small and subtle secondary contributions.

Always enjoyed 3 Floyds as it’s nice to see them available in this neck of the woods again! This was a clear winner as it had plenty going for it as it fit it's  massive IPA  description quite nicely, down to the last sip!  The look and feel to this was reminiscent of West Coast beers as it had a gorgeous copper hue to it with a fine haze and a bit of dark sediment floating around in it. Plenty of head topped it off as the lacing was deep, extensive, and beautifully layered all the way down the side of my pint glass. Loads of pine, resin, and grapefruit in the nose along with a bit of Caramel Malt as the taste nicely followed suit. Lots of floral notes that felt like Anchor emerged in the notes as this warmed up with a nice resinous body underneath that. The back had a ton of grapefruit and lemon zest to go along with some sweet malt that almost called for a chaser of water to finish this off, except I wanted the flavor to last as long as possible!  The carbonation was softly moderate and the body was balanced as the booze was not that noticeable. Loved the label on this can as this had a packaging dated of 12/28 on the bottom of the can. Aside from that being barely legible, this was a lovable beast of a beer that easily deserved another go-around. Who knew that one of the best left coast beers came out of Indiana?","  rDev Canned 12/28/20  And we're back with another imperial IPA from 3 Floyds. I loved their Permanent Funeral, and I'm hoping that this is in a similar vein. Regardless, I'm always on the lookout for new beers from them ever since they started distributing here in Mass. Let's dive right in  Pours a cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  On first whiff, this is a promising beer. It's big and in your face while also being balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of rich caramel, bready malt, juicy orange, resiny hops, apricot, and a touch of honey  There's less of a delicate balance in the taste, but it's still good for what it is. On the front end of the sip the malt dominates and I'm tasting caramel, soft bread, lightly floral hops, and a touch of lemon zest. The swallow bitters up a bit, bringing notes of pithy grapefruit, orange marmalade, fresh pine, herbal hops, and light bready malt  A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer.

Actual hazy burnt orange/marmalade colored body. Small bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering, leaving interesting lacing.  Lightly hoppy aroma.  On tasting, pretty aggressive beer. The malt sweetness is detectable, but merely serves as a platform for an all out (panzer) assault of bitter grapefruit and pine hops.

This smells supremely resinous, with stone fruit, orange peel, piney hops, with an almost burnt aroma.  I've been wanting to try this one since basically 2014, and it's finally available to me locally. It's an uncompromising old school bruiser. The taste is placed firmly back into the IBU wars of yesteryear, with a bit piney/grassy/pithy biterness, with bitter grapefruit, orange peel, and some slightly compromising stone fruit/orange sweetness. A lot of people wouldn't like this in today's juice bomb day and age. To me, it's a really great look back in time, and it still holds up for me today.  This is a slow sipper due to the intense pithy bitterness here. As it warms, bitterness retreats slightly, with a bit more fruity hop character. There is nothing  juicy  about this one.  I was excited to hear this was one in town on shelves, and it's met my expectations from back in my old money days. This was a great West Coast style IPA.","  rDev Well, this certainly has an aggressive name. I'm kind of tired of the arctic weather, but I'll take the big brew.  This pours deep golden with plenty of fizz and lacing. The aroma is not real strong but it is real good. Lots of hops and malts come through the nose and in the taste, which is darker and more bitter (not sweet) than you might expect in a high ABV brew. It feels big and bad, but not really boozy.

The hops come off as peachy to me. Full peach. Fuzz.   Arctic Panzer Wolf is more peach offering than bar brawl. See what I did there? This comes off as terrifically peachy to me with a moderate bitterness, crisp fall grass (not that I eat it often) against a gentle backdrop of white pepper &amp; citrus.

Head – Large (Maximum 5.3 cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, dense, good retention, diminishing to a two mm ring and thin complete layer with a heaped mound of dense foam. Head retraction leaves a wide band of tight lacing. Lacing – Excellent! As the level drops, in addition to the head retraction lacing, thick complete rings of curtain lacing. First pour – Light yellow, very slight haze. Aroma – 4.25 – Very piney, but it does fade a bit with time. Flavor – 4.5 – Begins moderately bitter with a solid malt backbone. The aftertaste has a bit of orange marmalade, so the label was right about that. No alcohol (9% ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.  Palate – 4 – Medium, almost creamy, soft carbonation. Impression and interpretation – 4.25 – When I looked at the bottle, I read it as “9-8-18”, probably because I was so excited to find a bottle Arctic Panzer Wolf.

This is the perfect complement for a wintry night. Prosit!","  rDev Light carbonation with a slick,thick,creamy feel. Aroma is roasted charred malt,wood,earthy, sweet malt, sweet black licorice  Taste is bitter charred malt on the finish and lingers. Licorice isnt as sweet as aroma suggests but very noticeable. Smokey,earthy,wood Excellent complex,full flavored. Not usually a fan of licorice but was great here and the other flavors are so strong and bold that the licorice doesnt dominate","  rDev Blackout stout pours black, with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet and smokey. Flavor, sweet smokey, hints of black licorice. Good body and feel. Overall, very tasty, a little sweeter, with a little smoke.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into New Belgium snifter.  Black as night with a creamy cappuccino beige head of 1/2 finger.  Aromas of bitter roasted dark chocolate and cocoa, with slight fudge icing, Columbian coffee and faint black licorice.  Flavor brings a dark bitter malty roastiness, followed by silky dark chocolate, acidic &amp; fruity coffee, and chocolate covered blueberries. It's utterly delicious.  Feel is creamy and smooth and roasty. Moderate warming alcohol which is entirely appropriate and completely pleasing.  Overall, one of my new favorite Imperial stouts of all time. This beer blew my mind. I had no idea what to expect, and I was blown away. At the price point? It may be the best Imperial Stout money can buy.","  rDev 12 oz  Pours opaque black, tan film for a head.  Smells of cocoa, licorice, molasses, mesquite and coffee.  Flavor is licorice, brown sugar, cocoa, coffee, pecan, walnut and toast.  Fuller body, tingly carbonation on the tongue.  Very rich and delicious, drinks dangerously smooth. Definitely worth trying and something I will have again.","  rDev A: silky dark jet black color with s thin tan head that fades quickly   S: dark chocolate, licorice, roasted malts. Oak, milk chocolate, and a hint of something like lactose sweetness  T: rich dark chocolate, cola, oak, nice smooth roasted malts, and some earthy hops. More chocolate and some sticky sweet malts as well  M: heavy mouth with medium carbonation  O: awesome stout. Rich, yet easy to drink. Definitely give it a try.

Black colored body, with a good portion presenting in a garnet color when backlit. Partial finger of light tan head, with a surface that is active from rising bubbles. Lacing quickly slides back down into body. Aroma of dark roasted malts, with dark coffee and chocolate, with a hint of dark fruit and molasses. Taste of dark coffee and chocolate from the dark roasted malts, joined in by raisins. Some fruity hops towards the end. Quite bitter as the taste trails away. Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation. Aroma and taste are very good, while the body is rather thin. Odd that there is no clinging lacing. Has a touch of dark fruit sour, and the bitter ending.","  rDev 12oz bottle bb 6/11/19 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at slightly warmer than fridge temp 9.9% ABV 50 IBU. The beer pours fairly dense very dark brown bordering on black with light mocha colored head. The head recedes to a few bubbles and a fat ring leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is semisweet coffee, dark chocolate and faint ash. The taste is dark chocolate and coffee at first with a touch of malt sweetness rolling into ashy, roast and earthy hop based bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is just enough final gravity to balance the bitterness, not enough to even approach cloying. Overall, very good to excellent. I could handle a slightly fuller body, but this is really top notch non-BA RIS.","  rDev Very good imperial stout, pours black with a head that sticks around for a while. The aroma is cocoa, licorise, roasted malt and not much else. The flavor is outstanding, tons of dark malt richness, lots of dark chocolate and dark fruit. The dark roast stays in the background and even though it is hoppier than many beers in the style it stays in balance. Overall this is a must try beer. It’s not hard to get and is one of the better non BA imperial stouts out there.","  rDev Pours black with a thin tan head that settles to a ring very quickly and leaves some blotchy lacing. Smells of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, roasted malts, black licorice, a hint of vanilla and raisins. Full bodied, medium carbonation, creamy mouth feel with a bit of stickiness.","  rDev L: Pitch black, with a small beige head. Poor retention, but a ring remains, leaving some streaky lacing.  S: Baking cocoa, bitter chocolate, star anise, black licorice, pumpernickel bread, earth, dark roast coffee, very slight soy sauce.  T: Dark chocolate and bitter cacoa upfront, as well as dark roast coffee. Molasses, black licorice, star anise, and pumpernickel bread follow. Finishes with soy sauce and a hint of vanilla, and then a lingering coffee ground, cocoa powder bitterness.  F: Creamy and fairly thick, yet smooth and well carbonated. The palate is left slightly sticky.  O: A really nice traditional imperial stout. Comparable to Old Rasputin and Narwhal.","  rDev 2016 version, poured into a snifter. Expected opaque dark brown color with a modest tan head. Nice lacing in the glass. Roasted grain and coffee aroma - no soy sauce or chocolate for that matter. Faint floral hop aroma. The taste brought in a nice chocolate note along with roasty flavors, some char, and a classic assertive floral bitterness. Full bodied but not sweet or overly boozy. Outstanding.","  rDev 12oz bottle with best if enjoyed by 8/10/10 date putting this at least 8-10 years old.

Tastes of milk chocolate, raison and slight oxidation with dusty grain and alcohol warmth.  Medium in body with modest carbonation. Solid stuff, very enjoyable.","  rDev Black in color with no penetration to light. There's a quarter inch of brown head resting on top. The aroma is of bitter, dark roasted barley and chocolate. I'm tasting lots of dark chocolate and bitter, dark roasted barley. The mouth is sticky, chewy, and viscous. I would swear that this is 11 or 12% based on the taste and texture.","  rDev Revisited 12/15/18  A -Pours a very dark opaque color ver little head and slight lacing. S -Aroma has hints of malt and chocolate. T -The taste follows the nose with malt, chocolate and coffee. M -A medium bodied unique tasting beer. O - A very well done beer. A good beer from a consistent brewery.","  rDev Poured from a bottle  best by 5/5/2018  into the test glass A - Deep dark backdrop,hides the solid carbonation. A light mocha cap of 1/2  last for a long time. S - Dark roast malt, some notes of cocoa, pumpernickel toast, and a hint of char are all wonderful T - Very clean elements of dark roast malt, a touch of coffee, bakers chocolate. M - Medium in body, a bit light on the palate, with an exceptional dry finish. O - A very good stout, clean and without any gimmick. Worth seeking out","  rDev Give this beer a new name, put it in a bomber and plan for a special release and it would be on fire. Outstanding appearance, great aroma with the malt, roast, dark chocolate and a taste that follow. Nice mouthfeel with not lingering bitterness. Outstanding brew, I need to go grab a few more of these while available.","  rDev L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and an opaque consistency. There was a small amount of foamy, tan-colored head that quickly dissipated. Solid lacing.  S: A decent, but not great aroma of roasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate, and hops.  T: Tasted of a bit of dark fruit (plums, raisins, for a start), some light hops (in the finish), lots of roasted malt, some dark chocolate (very nice), and a sugary element. This is one of those flavors that seems underpowered. You definitely get a good sense of the ingredients, but they're simply not forceful enough.  F: A fair amount of carbonation with a smooth finish. Medium-bodied.  O: I can't quite reconcile the score of this beer with the reality of it. Not bad, but not that interesting, especially compared to other Russian Imperials.","  rDev My hatas are legion! I was JUST taken to task for NOT drinking a beer from a CAN, but GLBC does not CAN their beers (yet), as far as I know &amp; I am trying to gird myself for today's eclipse. I am CANvinced that this is the beginning of the CANpocalypse &amp; so I am running through my inventory as quickly as possible.   From the bottle (2016 vintage):  Bold and dark as a power-less metropolis, our Russian Imperial Stout commemorates the infamous 2003 blackout that briefly left some 55 million people utterly unplugged.   Baby, I am plugging in with this one! I Pop!ped the cap &amp; began a gentle pour so as not to rouse the slumbering beasts within. Once properly decanted, I performed a vigorous in-glass swirl to raise two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with great retention. Color was ebony Black (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration, but I could sense Cthulhu &amp; The Kraken's presence in there. Nose smelled like something freshly-baked, like brownies or chocolate chip cookies with black coffee to wash them down. Perfect! Mouthfeel was medium, surprisingly light for this style. Once in my mouth, the beasties began to wrap their tentacles around my tongue &amp; squeeze. OMFG. The Kraken wedged himself in my throat to the point that I could no longer breathe! Where is my inhaler? Hell, where is my flamethrower?!? The taste was liquid dark chocolate, more brownies than chocolate chip cookies, but still with black coffee &amp; a Macanudo Maduro cigar thrown in for good measure. Oh, man, those nights on the SDTS fantail with Mike &amp; Kevin after mooring ,,, We would get cups of coffee &amp; I would break out my stash of cigars &amp; we would sit on the windlass &amp; look up at the highly visible stars. It was almost as good as having alcohol. I miss being underway. If only every beer could evoke such memories ... Finish was dry, more smoky than chocolaty &amp; lingering. Man, I really felt like I had just smoked a stogie. Gad, I miss it, but with adult-onset asthma, I can no longer indulge (except on VERY rare, exceptional occasions of which my doctor knows NOTHING about). One down.   From the bottle (2003):  WHO NEEDS THE POWER GRID? Not us, when we've got the full moon, bright stars, good friends and Blackout Stout, an imperial stout with a hearty malt body and bold hop flavor.   Oh, man, my cellar is simply burping forth all sorts of long-forgotten goodies! My problem was accumulating beer, but then I was traveling &amp; drinking away from home &amp; thus the backlog began. People are disappointed (or rejoicing) by my lack of personal appearances, but the Internet is blowing up as I have become a homebody to drink all of this beer.   I had been listening to The Scorpions'  Blackout , but now I have gone to Squeeze's  Black Coffee In Bed .  I Pop!ped the cap &amp; if you think that my earlier pour was gentle, this was spoon-fed! I finally got enough of it into a glass to be able to conduct a vigorous swirl, raising over two fingers of dense, foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with great retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), but this time, I was ready for the wee beasties! The Kraken &amp; Cthulhu were not going to catch me unawares. Mouthfeel was simply viscous. I have seen motor oil that was thinner than this concoction! Taste was medicinal, like the time that I sampled my grandparents' Geritol. Think dried dark fruits, treacle, anise, bittersweet chocolate chips &amp; you will be closing in on it. Phew! It was a very different drink than the modern version. F**ksake. it was the sort of Blackout-inducing stuff that I live for. Finish was extremely dry with the remaining yeast having had ample opportunity to ferment the sugars. Time to go stare at the Sun.","  rDev Garnet-jet with tan leggy cream. 4 Leather, ash, and rum barrel. 4.25 Chocolate cake, licorice, root beer, more chocolate icing, cherry skin, strong coffee, and slight earthy finish with some clean roast. 4 Creamy, chewy, medium. 4.25  Ton of chocolate, clean, no burn - this does a lot of things right. Dessert without cloying. Great Lakes with the mad skills on show. 4.25","  rDev Dark brown color with a bit of brown foam. Aroma has milk chocolate, pudding and sweet coffee. Taste starts on the sweet side as well with nice chocolate notes but finishes really bitter and roasty, even a bit ashy. Medium body and carbonation. It's a really classic imperial stout. Well made but nothing impressive.","  rDev 12 oz bottle poured into shaker pint.  A: Dark black in body with a creamy off white head on top.  S: Roasted Malts, chocolate, grains, light coffee  T: Follows the nose quite closely very rich slightly sweet but not too sweet and lots of roasted malts, chocolate, almost a coffee roast flavor and a little bit of anise and then followed by some alcohol heat.  M: Creamy and full not super thick drinks like a stout should.  O: This is a very solid regular stout the only thing I can ding it for is the alcohol is noticeable which is unpleasant otherwise this is Edmund Fitzgerald on steroids.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. I do not know exactly how old this bottle is but it is definitely has a few years in the bottle. The  For freshest taste, please enjoy by:  date on the label is 03/14/14.   The taste is incredibly dark and roasty with bittersweet chocolate, charcoal (?) and just a touch of lingering warmth in the finish. I imagine the taste flavors have smoothed out over the years. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, a very solid imperial stout.","  rDev Pours black with a finger of khaki head foaming to the top. Head retention is fair. Tiny bubbles pop out of the abyss of black liquid to help feed a thin foamy ring around the edge of the glass. Lacing is non existent. Roasted and toasted malts both pop out of the aroma first, setting Blackout Stout up for a solid, but otherwise standard, stout aroma. Chocolate, with a smidge of caramel peek through the otherwise malt driven aroma. Flavor profile unlocks some more depth, with malt notes expanding on the roasted and toasted varieties by way of biscuit malts. Chocolate, caramel, and molasses are more pronounced in the flavor profile then aroma. Mouthfeel has a filling, slightly grainy texture, which gets more aggressive and filling as the beer warms. Thickness ranges from medium to medium-thick as the beer's temperature rises. Overall, Blackout makes for an excellent stout. It fits squarely between thin stouts and stouts that could be considered a meal, making this a pleasant stout to visit for hearty malt notes without the heart stopping thickness of other stouts.   Served in a 12oz snifter.","  rDev 12/6/16...pours midnight black. Low foam, low bubble, pours smooth. Chocolately coffee nose, a touch sweet. Smooth bitter dark malt taste. Booze pokes through. Hints of whisky throughout. Powerful.","  rDev  Best by 5/6/16 ; drank 1/8/16 @ the Yarchives.   Poured from the bottle into a glass.  Dark brown appearance; purple emerged at the edges when held to the light.   A rough pour yielded a nice tan head; strong lace.   Fresh earth, cherry, cream &amp; black coffee notes in the nose.   Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel.   Caramel &amp; cherry flavors up front; black coffee &amp; cream notes on the finish. Faint booze heat emerged as this warmed.

Should be interesting.  Black/Brown body, small oatmeal colored head which eventually dissipates leaving okay lacing.   faintly boozy on the nose. some roasted malt. And as weird as this may seem, i swear a hint of Worcestershire sauce.   I cleansed the palate several times to try and figure out what i was tasting here. it is certainly pleasant, but i couldn't put my finger on it. not the usual cocoa/chocolate/coffee/toffee notes. but again, not unpleasant. sorry, i know I'm not being clear here.   mouth is between medium and full.   overall, a nice, if slightly odd stout. maybe it needs more (or less) aging.","  rDev Black as night pour - not a glimmer of light shines through. Virtually no head and rather flat looking. Aroma is blackstrap molasses plus expresso and bitter chocolate. Taste is excellent, no burnt notes and soft - smooth. We very much enjoy their Edmund Fitzgerald and this amps it up to  11 .","  rDev ** 04/22/2015 Bottle to pint glass. Aroma is sweet chocolate and BlackBerry, maybe cherry also. Touch of toasted barley. Appearance: Dark black color, small head. Looks almost a little thin. Taste: dark fruits, plum, fig, BlackBerry. Very tasty and sweet. Feel: flat. Only negative here is that it needs some carbonation. A very nice beer.

Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer. That said, it does have a bit of the trademark session IPA watery-ness, and there are other session IPAs out there with a bit more balance and flavor. Wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't be my  go to .","  rDev Appearance: Lightly hazy, bright golden hue, slim white head.  Aroma: As advertised, very vibrant and utterly bursting with hops. Bold and bright citrus and pine. Ah, so nice.  Taste: More of that big, fierce and shining hop flavor, with just enough juicy malt below. Lean bodied, with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness. Drinkable, yes, also refreshing and tasty, too. It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much. Faced with the choice of this or a regular Stone IPA, I know where I'm going.  This one is merely  okay , and that's not what I expect out of Stone. Low on my priorities.","  rDev 12oz botted 10-22-20, best by 2-19-21.

Canned on 10/26/17 with enjoy by date of 1/24/18 printed below it, I did not have this fresh but did keep it cold until I cracked it open today. It's been a while since I've had anything from Stone and although their IPA's were a big reason why I love that style so much now, this one was just a bit underwhelming to me...  The pour was decent as the liquid was golden, fairly translucent, and topped off with plenty of head. Only a few scattered sections of lacing were left behind once I took my first few sips. Tons of floral notes, citrus pith, dry lime, and smooth hops could be found in the nose but the overall appeal was that of a dry and earthy beer. That's exactly what this turned out to be once I sipped this as it felt much stronger than a session IPA and I needed a chaser of water to fully get this down. Some prickly pear cactus and pine emerged as this warmed up but the basic malt presence and grassy aftertaste weren't enough to put this over the top.  Regardless of the flavor profile, the lack of discernible alcohol made this somewhat easy to quaff and the slightly resinous aftertaste was a pleasant reminder that this was indeed an IPA and not a Pale Ale. Not really feeling this one but because of the age, it's hard to tell whether that was because of my inaction in getting around to this or the beer itself. If you're looking for a  light' version of their flagship IPA, reach for this and please, consume it fresh!","  rDev Pours a light gold coloration with a large, foamy head that recedes quickly. Smells wonderfully of floral hops and citrus fruit: grapefruit, lime, with a hint of tropical fruit: pineapple. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by floral, citrus hops: grapefruit, lime, with just a hint of biscuity malt and tropical fruits: pineapple, and pine. Finishes with a dry, light/medium bitterness and some sitrus notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium carbonation.  Even though the body is a little light, it's quite impressive how much hoppy goodness has been packed into this for a session IPA with such a relatively low ABV.","  rDev Canned May 2nd so it's all kind of fresh.   So, here we have another so called Session IPA. Most I have tried were lacking in balance, typical of the sub style.   I opened the can and yep, that smell of a Session IPA is there in spades.   Somewhat tropical nose, grapefruit, nary a malt aroma to be had.   The taste is fairly bitter, grapefruit, hints of tropical fruit..pineapple, mango buried fairly deep, cracker malt buried even deeper.

As they say  Cans are Better ","  rDev I think this the first time I have had a tall boy can from Stone. The medium suits them. Huge, patient white head appears from a strong pour above a golden body teeming with carbonation bubbles. Grapefruit is the loudest voice in the nose, along with biscuit, pine needles, and tropical fruits (guava?)   Taste is heavy on citrus and malts, but lacks the bitterness and any figment of face clenching. While extremely easy to put down, the texture and body both are a little thin. This is perfectly fine, just like the Founder's All Day and NB's Dayblazer, but not really a fully formed IPA as we have come to accept them.   I want to stress that this is still an excellent drinkng beer, and certainly has its place in your fridge, particularly when you have something to do with the rest of your day besides drool and watch sports. I just feel it is not really fair to measure this up against Ruinaition or Jai Alai or something. I continue to think that Session IPAs deserve ther own category because they are fundamentally different beers with different goals than traditional IPAs.","  rDev Deep yellow in color with an orangish hue and light chill haze. Poured with a moderate, soapy, bright white foam with medium high retention. Fresh citrus aromas of orange a lemon zest. Light malt aroma beneath. Medium light bodied with high, yet soft, carbonation that nicely gives the impression of a fuller body. Light creaminess from the middle to the end. Medium high orange and lemon citrus flavors up front with light maltiness. Medium bitterness through the middle with spicy hop and caramel maltiness in tow. Finished with spicy hop and caramel malt flavors along with a light bitterness. One of the best low abv ipas I've tasted. Good body and feel along with solid hop character and just enough malt to balance it out.","  rDev From a can. I really loved this session IPA, maybe the best one I've had so far. Smooth mouthfeel and big hop presence all along. Citrus (mostly grapefruit), pine resin, watermelon.  Once again a great beer from Stone Berlin","  rDev Pours a clear hay gold with a nice finger and a half of head. Good lacing and retention. Smell is nice and fruity hops with a touch of pine. Taste is pithy citrus and tropical. There is a bit more pine on the tongue. Malts roll in on the second wave. Feel comes with prickly hard carbonation and a dry finish, medium to light body.   Definitely a Stone beer, this may or may not be sessionable though. I enjoyed it.","  rDev Purchased this one online and poured into a neutral Teku.   Pours a lovely copper-gold with a hint of haze and excellent carbonation, thoigh head retention left something to be desired and the foam has a soapsuds appearance. Lacing is on the smaller side of moderate.  Smell is huge lemon zest with a big undercurrent of pine. Their  hop-bursting  technique is in full force. Not much malt to speak of, and those qualities translate over to the flavor as well.  Huge flavors of grapefruit and lemon with pleasant bitterness and grass/pine notes underneath. I do prefer my IPAs to have more body, but the big hops flavor helps make the compromise between light session and full bodied IPA. This also has a nice sweetness as the small amount of malt matures on the tongue.   Mouthfeel is very crisp and light, and they really nailed the refreshing session beer quality.   This is a nice way to start off a hot summer evening and is definitely a great way to get your hops fix without the heavy malt feel of a full IPA. Though I'm not a big fan of session beers, this one does it quite well.  To good health and good beer.","  rDev Time for some Stone GO TO IPA, Go Directly to IPA, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT 200 [IBU’s]. Look we all know I’m no fan of Session IPAs (or Session beers in general), so why am I even bothering with reviewing this brew? Because it’s a Stone beer FFS, that’s why. If Stone can’t sway me over to the Session beer cause then there is a good chance nobody will... So perhaps this will be my last Session beer review? Maybe, but I’m not missing much if it is - they’ve all been watery AF pale imitators of the real thing (i.e. the beer style they are a session version of) and if you think I’m wrong, then I dare you tell me which Session beer you think is better than a full-fat brew, go on! Do it! *prods reader with a yardstick*  Poured from a 473ml can into a nonic pint.  A: Pale yellow, with a hint of haze body and a billowy white 2 centimetre head on top that ever slowly compresses down... quite a pale colour for a Session IPA... still looks as sexy as ever for Stone... maybe it’s just a Pavlovian response from me due to how tasty Stone beers are? 8/10.  S: Grassy cannabis hop character with a vibrant lychee tropical note, Stone haven’t dropped the ball yet when it comes to hops in an IPA - and Go To is no exception. Malt character is lacking, and it comes with the characteristic thinness of a session beer, but the hop character is there in full force... hint of mango and piney hops, nice touch Stone! 8/10.  T: Flavour is a bit thin and watery overall though [sad face]. There’s just no escaping this is a Session IPA, even the brewing Gods at Stone (murmured: “in Koch we trust”) can’t avoid the insipidness of the session beer. Profile is: Grassy/lychee/piney hops, malt? None really, and a thin green herbal note in the finish... which BTW is more bitter than expected or warranted - yep, I went there. 6/10.  M: Not bad, mid to light bodied with a reasonably dense carbonation - Stone Go To IPA isn’t lacking in texture, just flavour. 8/10.  D: Go To IPA? Not for me thanks, I’ll stick to Mocha IPA - which FYI is f**king delicious - or pretty much any other Stone IPA, this is by far the worst Stone beer I’ve tried [bloody session beers again - bane of my and the best of breweries existences!] Let’s all say “no!” to session beers... oh yeah, and drugs [except alcohol, which is f**king brill]. Positives? Everything except flavour, which really is the only thing that matters in the end. 7/10.

No clear freshness dating.  Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body, generous tan head persists in good form throughout, leaving some interesting lacing.  Lovely chocolate aroma, chocolate malt and cocoa.  On tasting, slightly sweet, nicely chocolatey, and as it warms, there is the faintest of roasts for balance. Loving this one   Mouth a little above medium, though seems thinner. Finish chocolate malt.  Overall, just a delightful beer. Strongly chocolate, but not cloyingly sweet. Many a pastry stout brewer out there could learn something from this beer and it's makers.","  rDev 550 ml bottle, at the Robert Raike’s House (a Samuel Smith pub), Gloucester. Served ice cold.

Medium sweet flavour of chocolate, cocoa and vanilla again. Low bitterness.","  rDev Poured into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a three finger khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Looks great. Aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate and a suggestion of caramel. Flavor is dark toasted malt with a touch of char, milk chocolate, vanilla and some hazelnut in the finish. Lingering lightly nutty chocolate finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. All Samuel Smith stouts are worthy, but this is their stellar product. Looks great, smells choclatey as it should and packs a lot of flavor in a modest ABV stout. I drink mostly imperial stouts now and have a bit of trepidation trying standard strength ones because of a high expectation palate. It's a well made 5% stout that gives me the flavor burst I want and this one delivers. The chocolate is well handled and authentic tasting. I first tried this decades ago and it was one of my regular stouts, but for some reason I never reviewed it. Glad to try it again. A fine stout.","  rDev Pours a dark brown with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of sweet chocolate. Smooth and creamy. Very enjoyable.","  rDev Currently ranked #1 in the Top  Stout - English  list with an overall score of 95.  I nabbed a 4-pack of 355ml bottles at a Total Wine &amp; More (Metairie, Louisiana) for $12.99 USD plus tax.   Organic Chocolate Stout.   Malt beverage with natural flavor added.   Ingredients; water, organic malted barley, organic cane sugar, yeast, organic hops, organic cocoa extract, carbon dioxide. (Notice that there is no actual chocolate used in the brewing of this beer...just cocoa extract and roasted chocolate malt). 5% ABV.   Nutrition Information (typical values per 100g):  Energy 212kJ/50kcal Fat 0g Carbohydrates 5.8g Of which sugars 2.6g Protein 0.4g Salt 0g  Served chilled into a stemless wine glass.  APPEARANCE: Pours a robust head khaki in colour appearing very creamy and thick. Excellent frothiness. Excellent (~10+ minute) head retention.  Body is true to style...opaque black. No yeast/lees are visible within, but of course it's opaque...still, it does look filtered.  Appears perfectly carbonated. Nails the style appearance-wise. Wisps of lacing cling to the sides of my glass as the head recedes. Certainly an enticing brew....sumptuous.  AROMA: More subdued/less intense than I'd imagined coming in...yes, it evokes chocolate malt and cocoa extract, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it. Faint roasted barley and dark malts/black malts back the cocoa with malt sweetness and roasty almost coffee-like bitterness, complementing it well. Aroma promises a chocolate stout that's perfectly balanced; so many American chocolate stouts are overly sweet but this packs enough roasted barley in that it seems perfectly dialed in.  True to the style, no overt yeasty or hoppy aromatics are obvious.  One of the most genuine cocoa aromas I've encountered in any beer.  TASTE &amp; TEXTURE: Silky soft with a bit of dryness up front from the roasted barley. Aptly medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Not too thick or syrupy like many chocolate stouts.  The creaminess and softness of its texture accentuates the gooey chocolate malts at its core and coaxes out more depth of chocolate flavour from the cocoa. I don't taste any cidery off-flavour despite the beer's use of cane sugar. True to style, no overt hoppy flavours are noticeable and the English ale yeast leaves this drinking clean with just the right amount of residual sugars.  It flirts with a malted milk ball flavour but luckily never quite delves too deep into it (I'm not a fan personally).  It's impeccably well balanced, harmonizing faint roasted barley with its chocolatey flavours. The chocolate/cocoa always tastes genuine, which is more than I can say about most chocolate beers (including those that actually do use real chocolate). This is the rare beer brewed with  natural  flavors that actually tastes natural.  Finishes on a chocolatey sweetness that rings authentic. This never tastes like Hershey's syrup or garbage American chocolates, but to pick a nit, it doesn't quite evoke the best chocolate out there (Belgian, Swiss, et al.). Still, Belgian chocolate is a bit too powdery to feel right in beer form and Swiss is probably too rich.  OVERALL: I didn't expect such roastiness in an English chocolate stout, but its presence is welcome and speaks to the brewers' mastery of balance. Or maybe they're just ripping a page out of Guinness' handbook. In any case, it's an even keeled chocolate stout with a genuine taste. I could imagine the chocolate character itself a bit more expressive and the beer overall better in terms of depth of flavour, but this is a stupidly drinkable 5% ABV stout that isn't trying to compete with the crazy intense imperial stouts dominating the scene across the pond. And I could easily crush multiple pints in a single sitting, which is more than I can say about most chocolate beers/chocolate stouts.  A classic, and a top tier expression of the style.  High B (3.74) / GOOD","  rDev It seems that it’s happened a few times that the first beer I try in a given style is the top rated of the style, with this English stout being yet another example. I have heard so much about this one for years, I’m not sure what my hesitation was to pick it up, considering it’s widely available and damn cheap at $2.50 for a single  Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of rocky tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  The nose dances a fine line between a nuanced experience and an all out chocolate bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of creamy milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, sticky maple, lightly roasted malt, and a touch of raisin  The taste loses a bit of its nuance, though it is still good. On the front end I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, and sweet malt. The swallow drys up a bit, bringing notes of roasty malt, creamy vanilla, and more of the milk chocolate that defines the experience  A soft medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a super silky beer. Finishes mostly dry, setting up each subsequent sip  This is a delicious beer, though a bit one dimensional. A nice session stout for the colder months","  rDev Bottle copped from Buy Rite in South Orange. Impressive appearance consisting of a full-bodied tan head with coffee cream lacing. Mild aroma faintly reminiscent of cocoa and anise. Smooth texture combines with a silky mouthfeel to round out a brew that is easily drinkable and not too cloying. Decent stuff.","  rDev Black, with ruby red highlights. Foamy tan head. Great retention and lacing. Cocoa dusted almonds, milk chocolate candy, dried fig cherry on the aroma. Nice bittersweet cocoa flavor, hints of milk chocolate, roasted almonds, chocolate covered cherry, fig and raisin, toasted burnt brown bread and a hint of coffee. Moderately carbonated, medium body, good body for 5%.  A classic. Super tasty.","  rDev Poured from a 550-ml bottle into a Samuel Smith nonic pint glass. Deep, dark, lightproof brown colored body, with a light tan head that left lots of sticky lacing. Cherry and chocolate dominate the aroma profile. There is an almost artificial-medicinal quality to the fruity aromas and flavors. Medium bodied, with good carbonation and a mostly dry finish with a little lingering sweetness and a touch of bitterness on the back end. Overall, a pretty enjoyable quaff in small doses.","  rDev Aroma: I'm mentioning this first, but it fills the air, as soon as the bottle is opened and floods the sense. Full and beautiful. More of a baker's cocoa than anything else. Still haven't lifted the glass to the nose, so here it goes. Deep, rich, milky, creamy, semi-sweet, and not a little bit bitter. Everything you want from chocolate, here in this stout.  Appearance: solid black with ruby-brown highlights at foot and side. Creamy brown head on top.  Taste: Bam! Chocolate milk, sweet, rich, indulgent. Small bitterness, lush malt, cocoa flavor swims through the mouth, creamy and delightful. You can't help but throw it back and want some more. Medium mouthfeel, moderate bitterness, full flavor, incessant cocoa taste.  The organic label, this time, does not yield a disappointing product, as is so often sadly the case. This beer is 100% yum. Who cares how organic it is, it's nothing but delicious. Highly recommended.","  rDev 550mL of an absolute classic, served in a curved stout glass. Beer pours very dark in color, appearing brown only around the outermost edges. Thick head the color of chocolate milk which falls relatively quickly. Milk chocolate aroma is sweet like candy. The flavor of chocolate is there, but the sweetness of a chocolate bar is there, too, overpowering all of the malty goodness an English Stout should have. It's tasty enough, but as a chocolate stout I think Young's and Rogue are better.","  rDev Drinking this at European Street Cafe in Jacksonville Florida on a cold and blustery day. Poured from a bottle into a mug. Appears dark brown almost black with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin ring. Smells malty, chocolatey sweet. Taste follows the nose, middle of the road sweetness for the style. Mouth feel is medium for the style. Overall, the best UK Chocolate Stout that I have had. A true classic import, I would definitely order again.","  rDev 12 oz. bottle. Pours fizzy dark brown. Not much of a head. Smells of cocoa and nutty malts. Tastes very chocolatey. Sweet chocolate with low bitterness. A little bit of toasted malt in the back. Medium body. It's not that sweet, but it comes off as sweet as there isn't much bitterness to cut it. Good for such a low alcohol chocolate beer, but still a little too sweet for me.","  rDev 550ml bottle, no discernable date on the labels, poured into a stemless wine glass.  The beer pours a very nice cola brown color, nearly jet black with a great finger or so of bone colored head that has great retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is lovely, smooth chocolate, rich and bittersweet, modest coffee roast, hearty brown bread, a touch of vanilla cream, a bit of chalkiness but a very rich and decadent nose. The flavors are very nice, rich bakers chocolate, bittersweet dark chocolate as it warms, rich vanilla and cream, modest coffee that comes across like a nice mocha with a great hearty grain base a touch of stone fruits. The mouthfeel is good, coating and smooth, heavier medium body that feels rich and luscious with a creamy finish.  Verdict: A very nice stout from Samuel Smith. Rich, decadent, smooth and creamy with a wonderful expression of chocolate that feels like a much bigger beer.","  rDev Raul is feelin’ this one just like last nights lap dance. Feeling it on all levels like in Little League when hitting it to the kid in right field that played defense like Ted Williams.   Honestly though, it’s just kind of there. Not bombastic, and not large and in charge. This beer is like the girl you should marry; just beautiful and subtle goodness.","  rDev From a 12 oz bottle into a Yeti snifter. Well...it is certainly very chocolatey, but too sweet for me; it stops just short of becoming cloying. In addition to the chocolate, there are some extremely clean sweet grain notes, as well. Silky and a bit thin and almost but not quite watery on the mouthful, no hop liveliness, nor any kind of bitterness from the roasted grain, which seems to be perfect to style.   I do think that this is exceptionally well made -- there isn't a rough moment or a hint at a flaw in the design or execution, that I can discern -- so if rating to style, it has to be fairly high. It is a bit one-note and there's not much development of different kinds of notes over the mouthful, nor are there really layers. In terms of my beer-drinking pleasure, I'd rate it as good but not great.","  rDev Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass  A: Pours dark brown with a slight mahogany hue and a frothy tan head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.   S: Rich chocolate, roasty, earthy, slightly nutty, vanilla, sweet cream, and caramel, and faint herbal notes.   T: Milk chocolate, vanilla, sweet cream, caramel, brown sugar, slightly nutty, roasty side slowly comes out, light underlying earthy and herbal notes, and a hint of char.   M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy.   O: Kinda torn on how to score this one. The chocolate flavor fantastic, but it is a bit on the sweet side which makes the flavor seem a bit less stout like. Still an enjoyable desert beer.","  rDev This may have been cellar aged but it had a great occasion to showcase this beer, the last day before pubs and bars were ordered to shut shared with good beer drinking friends Hint of coconut with quite a milky chocolate taste","  rDev Poured into a Sam Smith Imperial pint glass I have had for years. Huge head that almost overflows, so almost 8 oz woth of head volume on a 12 oz beer. Color is a dark walnut. Solid. Nose is pure chocolate.  Nice medium texture with reams of cocoa flavors, supplemented by a healthy grain bill. Rich, complex aftertaste, with some bitter baker's chocoklate tones and some burnt flavors balanced out by creamy milk and silky oats and nuts. The cocoa is still the overwhelming master of its domain.   I like my English style ales as much as the next man, and love me some Sam Smith's, and this is very good, but not quite great, despite its obvious merits.","  rDev Tasted from a 550 ml bottle.  L - Deep brown color that is just this side of black. Opaque, but when held up to the light garnet shows at the edges. Huge pillow of off-white head that lasts and lasts.  S - Delicious milk chocolate aromas. Some roasted grain in background. No hops or yeast apparent.  T - Bitter roasted grains blend with sweet milk chocolate. Great depth of flavors.  F - Medium body with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. Hops bitterness is barely detectable, but it holds the sweetness back. No alcohol presence.  O - Amazingly clean and complex flavors in a beer that is only 5% ABV. Wow!","  rDev Poured into a Guinness pint glass.  Pours very very dark, but not opaque dark brown. It lets just a touch of light through, revealing that the brew is nearly crystal clear, despite the darkness. The head is tan, foamy, and excellent. It lingers and the legs and lacing endure. The foam clings down the side of the glass. This is a spectacular look.   The aromas are simple but very well-defined and distinguished. Milk and semi-sweet chocolate aromas predominate. Hints of coffee, caramel malt, and hops hide in the background.   This brew delights each segment of the tongue. The brew is definitely sweet on first presentation, but never seems cloying. Milk-stout-like sweetness on the tip of the tongue. Chocolate flavors (milk and cocoa) abound initially, but some vanilla, nutty, and creamy notes arrive as the brew warms in midstream. As the brew flows to the finish, Just a kiss of roast and char as well as bakers'-bitter chocolate in the back of the tongue provide a restrained but welcome bitter note to offset everything else. As the brew warms, the finish also opens and reveals just enough grassy hop notes to remind us we're drinking a beer here.  The body and feel of the brew is where the battle on this one was won, I think. Despite everything that is going on, this feels, on reflection, like a merely medium-bodied brew. The carbonation endures well, which helps finish the quaff. Yet it feels smooth, creamy, velvety.  Is this really a beer? It's almost more like a tasty dessert drink. But everything about the feel and finish says  brew  not  dessert.  This is pretty special.","  rDev 18.7 oz. bottle poured into Samuel Smith nonic with CO2 nucleation point (SE13S1 printed on neck of bottle)  L: black-and-tan perfection, the beer pours a clear dark brown-amber but piled into the glass it's black topped by a thick, dense head of creamy tan foam; I poured as soft as possible to let the nucleation point do it's job, and wow ... it's a perfect pour, and now the head is sticking too ... among the easiest 5s I've run across  S: sweet stale wood, cocoa powder, earthy burnt wood  T: chocolate beer ... there's a bit of roasted malt woody/earthy something in there and a wonderful lingering wood flavor, but the chocolate leads everything and at times dominates; it's not super sweet milk chocolate, but it's also not bitter baker's chocolate; maybe a pinch of earthy hop flavor is helping balance, but it seems like more of the earthy/bitter balancing flavor is coming from the roasted malt that has a dryness to it  F: the first third to a half of the pint is perfect — you drink through a constant 1/2-inch head of that meringue-like foam, so it's nice and soft and fluffy, but there's still enough carbonation left in the liquid to give it a wee layer of crispness; the weight of the beer seems relatively big for 5% ABV, amost midweight  O: it was stupid of me to wait so long to try this one; now that I have, I'll revisit this beer often ... in fact, as soon as I clear out some of the beer currently in my fridge, I'm envisioning a collection of Nut Brown Ales and Organic Chocolate Stouts taking up residence, for I bet this chocolate stout would follow a good English pale ale wonderfully","  rDev Aroma is chocolate, cocoa, and more chocolate. Smells like a chocolate malt.  Deep black, with visible carbonation bubbles. Dark ruby with a backlight. Tall tan head is thick and creamy, with good retention, leaving a dome in the center as it does recede. Nice looking lacing, rings with dropping fingers between the rings.  Taste is chocolate, cocoa powder really, with a nice counter from the hops and malts, making the taste have a bit of berry, nuts with just a bit of coffee coming from the malts. No bitterness at all. However, as the beer warms, the taste develops an almost artificial flavor. I know the label says this beer is all natural flavors, organic, and all that, but still it becomes a bit of a struggle to finish the last 25% of the glass if you let it linger too long. Prior to that, though, it is quite enjoyable, if you like cocoa!  Mouth feel is moderate toward the thin side, a little carbonation feel, creamy and smooth.  Overall, a well done stout, with the chocolate dominance the brewer was going for.","  rDev Pours so dark brown that it looks black with a 1 finger thick foamy tan head that faded slowly and left really nice rings of foamy lacing. Basically smells of dark chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder, faint herbs and chocolate syrup.  Tastes like it smells with dark chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder, baker's chocolate, faint herbs and chocolate syrup, plus faint additions of vanilla, piney hops and burnt coffee grinds as it fades. It’s quite complex and tasty but too sweet to have more than one in a sitting even with the silky smooth feel that flows down easy.","  rDev Black color with a huge thick dark beige head with eternal retention. Predominant aroma with notes of creamy cocoa fruit, lots of coconuts, sweet cocoa powder and nuts. Flavor with notes of chocolate and hazel nut concentrate, cola, yeast, sprinkles of cocoa, mild red berries, lots of brown sugar and a hint of homemade coffee. Dry aftertaste with a mild bitterness. Light bordering medium velvety body with mild carbonation. I liked better the chocolate notes of their traditional Oatmeal Stout, this felt a bit artificial. Also, the other one felt more balanced /hoppier. On the other hand, it provided cocoa fruit notes (the white pulp) and hazelnut.","  rDev Pours black as oil with a bigger, darkbrown, spongy head.  Smells of cacao, bakers chocolate and milk chocolate, together with a light note of roasted hazelnuts.   Has a creamy and smooth mouthfeel, due to its lighter body with a fitting carbonation spark during the finish.  Tastes of earth covered milk chocolate, light vanilla and toffee, together with a fantastic, ongoing whipped cream smoothness. Has a lighter roastiness then with a subtle cacao bitterness to it, offering a chocolate/coffee interplay. Finishes sweeter, with more toffee, a lighter honey note and a long lasting, earthy and slightly bitter chocolate aftertaste.  Quite traditional and very tasty interpretation of a Stout, which appears bigger on the palate then its abv indicates.","  rDev Really nice dark beer with equal head. Smells delicious chocolate. Taste is pure chocolate. Easy to drink and overall an exceptional beer. From a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.","  rDev -clear, deep mahogany bottle pour with persistent tan foam cap.

A sweet treat, better enjoyed with a friend.","  rDev Wow, I wasn't expecting much from this but damn - this is good...  Right out of the bottle it looked fantastic - beautifully black, nice thick head, and lacing all the way down. The smell is an almost perfect blend of chocolate and malts, with a nice sweet tange in the nose. This translates to the taste as it may be the best chocolate stout I've had to date. What makes this special is the spicy nature of the taste - unique to any other I've had up until now. Mouthfeel is carbonated, light, and maybe not the best aspect of the beer.

A highly drinkable and flavorful American version of the style.","  rDev A classic example of an American-made Belgian pale, but not the best of such. Pale straw in color with half a finger of head. Malt-forward on the nose, with a heavy floral presence and light syrupiness on the palate. Mild Belgian esters, but not too aggressive in any dimension.

S: Sharp tart red apple and pear, unripe banana, sugar cookie/vanilla wafer, hay, plum, coriander.  T: Lots of tart red apple skin, pear, unripe banana, and hints of lemon. Crackery/vanilla wafter malt backbone. Coriander and hay with hints of yeast ester spice, but a bit restrained on esters. Finishes lightly dry.  F: Medium, highly carbonated, smooth, crisp, clean, and lightly dry.  O: A really solid American Belgian strong pale ale. Recommended.","  rDev 12oz bottle PKGD 05052017  Poured into a tall oversized tulip shows a cloudy orange-tinged yellow gold body that supports a fluffy 1in white head, but unfortunately no lacing. Constant rising bubble activity.  Aromas include banana, white vinous grapes, slight clove and biscuit malt for a floral combination.

Overall a solid style reference.","  rDev Solid golden color with a thick thin head with short retention. Aroma with notes of pineapple juice, candi sugar, orange marmalade, biscuit malt, pears, banana and pine.

Dry aftertaste with a mild bitterness. Medium to full body with appropriate carbonation. Faithful to Style Belgian Strong Ale with hops and spices on the milder side of the style and predominant fruity notes.","  rDev Slightly hazed golden color with a thin white head that forms a lasting crown.  Sweet aroma with white wine grapes and Belgian yeast.  Sweet tasting as well, white grape, a hint of apricot, very light and dull hop bitterness and a touch spicy.  Medium bodied, a bit syrupy, with strong carbonation.  Pleasant enough, sweet, Belgian intro beer.","  rDev This beer pours a nice, fairly clear, golden color. Minimal white head, but nice carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. The nose has a nice rich malt smell. There's also a hint of sweetness to it.  The taste is pretty complex. It starts off a bit mellow. Hardly there. Then it starts kicking in with a malt and sweetness that you taste, and feel all the way down.  This is a very full bodied beer. No watery feeling at all. Nice feel of the carbonation bubbles going down.  Damn delicious overall. So glad I decided to buy it, and try it. Solid beer.","  rDev L: hazy, yellow gold color, minimal head and lacing, lots of carbonation S: faint Belgian yeast, some fruitiness  T: nice flavor, apples and pear notes F: nice tongue coating  O: very well made","  rDev Pours an opaque golden honey color with big white head leaving minimal lacing. Nose is mild with fruit and yeast dominating. Taste continues with mild sweetness and an almost dry finish.","  rDev Orange gold color,fruit yeast aroma.this is a great version of a Belgian. What made it unique is that it wasn't too spicy or Laden with orange like so many other brewerys copying this style. Very enjoyable and way too easy to drink more than one which is when the abv starts to hit you. Even that is well balanced as it's not so high that you regret having more than one","  rDev A: Straw yellow with some cloudiness, highly carbonated, 2 fingers of white, foamy head that has small and large bubbles, rather like meringue.  S: Belgian yeasts, lemon citrus, blue cheese sharpness.  T: Follows nose completely. Belgian yeasts, lemony citrus, blue cheese sharpness. Reminds me of Unibroue.   M: Medium light body with high carbonation.  O: A great example of its style, out of the box from other North Coasts I’ve had so I feel proud of them. Really reminds me of Unibroue, something about American examples that come so close but don’t quite exactly get the European Belgians, but I appreciate them anyways. 9.1 out of 10.

Smell is sweet, lightly spiced malt, with apple, banana, wheat, and pear. Brightly spiced, faint clove, and fresh seeming--nothing too heavy.  Belgian yeast comes first in taste, but is not too overbearing, with a little pear and apple, light wheat, clove, sweet toffee and candy corn malt.  Frothy full bodied yet light, with a semi dry finish.","  rDev A mixture of yellow and orange in the appearance, plenty of haze, white head 1/2 . Aroma hit all those belgian spice rack clove, pepper, banana type of notes.  Taste has a big presence of alcohol, light colored fruits, clove, phenols. Its like a blend of belgian pale ale and tripel. I think it tastes hotter than the 7.6% abv.","  rDev An excellent stateside take on this style--especially for the price.   Appearance--A perfect hazy gold and true to the style, with good lacing and carbonation.   Aroma--Malts forward, but dry and crisp.  Taste--A nice balance of malty sweetness and spice. The alcohol  warmth  is definitely there, but never overpowers.   Mouthfeel--Excellent carbonation, and a nice  lightness  for the style that makes this remarkably drinkable. The  booze  comes through at the end to remove any doubt.  Overall--A pleasant take on the style that is very drinkable for the ABV. Special note--for the price, you cannot go wrong with this brew. There are many other  takes  on this style that are no better or are inferior that will set you back much more than Pranqster. A fine take for the money that I will enjoy again.","  rDev On tap at Taj Mahl, Boise. Cloudy orange amber with small skin of a head. Aroma had lots of floral/citrus notes.

This fine Belgian style ale pours a nice bright golden color with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin layer, and sports nice light lacing. Nose of Belgian candy sugars, bubblegum, clove, and light yeasty bread notes. Flavors follow the nose with candy malts and clove on the front and middle, bubblegum falls off to the sides of the taste and fades into the rear with a yeasty breaded note with a touch of pears and apples. Nice crisp mouth feel, lightly dry on the finish, and VERY satisfying. Overall and excellent brew.  Cheers","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a snifter, a cloudy yellow. A nice but short lived head with good lacing. Sweet apple smell and fruity taste. The taste is accented by vanilla and sweet spice. Smooth feel. A very nice beer!","  rDev Appearance: Light hazy gold, good cap and lacing.  Aroma: Sweet caramel malt, rather rich scent, luscious ripe banana, herby floral spicy hops but not too much.  Taste: Belgian, yes, that's it. Sweet malt, yellow fruit and clove/spiciness. Complex, all the flavors touches and texture come together nicely. Not quite as refined as the Grand Cru Belgians but a good representative none the less. Consistent flavors all the way through and clean finish. Desert like aftertaste.  Mousse like texture with a slight bubbly prickle.  Overall: Widely available, this one is proof a brew doesn't have to be a limited edition to be in the upper ranks. Worth seeking out.","  rDev North Coast Pranqster, 7.6% ABV, 20 IBU, Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Lots of head that lasts. Nose is slight citrus, smells  fresh . Taste is also citrus, not much bitterness, carbonation moderate to heavy. Very drinkable - could put a number of these away on a hot day, and the alcohol would sneak up on you since it doesn't come through on the taste. This would be good to serve guests who are used to BMC, though would be good to give them a heads-up on the 7.6% ABV. This is going on my favorites list.","  rDev While most successful in the heavier, darker part of the English tradition, North Coast has produced several high-quality Belgians that can compete with those from the home country. And Pranqster is one of them. In fact, it seems to have improved as I matured over the last eight years since I've Had my first Pranqster.  It opens with an unmemorable Look (no foam)... except there is a nice orange tinge to its gold. Smells are close to the fruits cast off by the classic Belgian yeast that plays with sweet malt well. Taste is mostly that sweet malt and balanced by the spices, hops including coriander. Personally, I'd even like more spice... something a malt-head like me rarely says.  OA: A Complete ale and nearly Complex. And the high alcohol does not interfere with enjoying a fine golden. Pranqster finishes a bit drier than expected (given the swell malt and dose of brewer's sugar.) The yeast guides an overall experience that I'll imagine goes well with food. That will be the subject of future reviews.  8/17/17 Had again with my world-famous ratatouille (my standard for comparing golden ales) and it did its job; hops cut through the oil and yeast played nice with the garlic. Sweet malt helped me salivate over this average batch... despite being world-famous.  7/7/19 had again but without food. Also refreshing. A versatile ale.  5/30/20 Bought a 4 pack. Edited review and slightly reduced rating for because Pranqster's yeast really needs to be livened up again. I'm going to keep count over at UnTappd."]},{"Name":"A Little Sumpin' Wild","Link":"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/220/57912/","Brewery":"Lagunitas Brewing Company","Style":"IPA - Belgian","Alcohol":8.80,"Score":91.0,"Comments":["  rDev Not at all what I expected, completely blew my mind.

Appearance: The body has a deep amber color with a thick cloudy yeast haze. It’s topped off with a quick setting head of off white foam. Only a light thin film covering remains after a minute. Lacing is minimal and slick.   Smell: The aroma has sweet bready maltiness with notes of honey and then loads of pineapple, apple peel, orange peel and some pine like hops.   Taste / Palate: The flavor is full of sweet honey notes inside of a deep bready and yeast like base with waves of different fruity notes. My bottle is fairly well aged so hop bitterness is much lower than a fresh bottle. It also worth noting that the 8.85abv is not noticeable at all. The palate and feel are fairly full and smooth.

Rich golden amber body with a soft white head taking up the top finger's width of the glass. Good retention, beautiful lacing.  Aroma is banana and yeast, somewhat bready and maybe some faint grassy hops.  Taste starts off with a bang of both sweet belgian notes and a surprising hop bitterness. Belgian fruits and sugars meet a harsh piney bitterness. A fair amount of alcohol as well. The aftertaste is bitter and almost pithy but without the citrusy element if that makes sense. But also a high note of candi sweet. Also the fact that it's almost 9% is quite evident here.","  rDev Julian date 276. A Pours a rich golden body with a fluffy off-white head. S The aroma is jumping out of the glass, tropical hops and a peppery spice. Pine and oranges as it warms up. T Interesting combination of ripe fruit on the first sips that lead to a flash of bitterness and the slightest amount of spice. As it warms the taste of the hops is more bitter and piney.  M Slick going down and mildly bitter after. When warmer I would call the mouth feel creamy. O This is a fantastic Belgian style IIPA. Not to funky and hoppy in all the right ways. This ale is dangerously drinkable for the alcohol content.","  rDev If I'm reading the bottle correctly this may have been brewed in May 2014 and I'm seeing it in my area of Frederick, MD for first time in early November 2014 (5-6 months). Have to say, it is very similar to Flying Dog's Raging Bitch in most all attributes (had a RB just the other day). Perhaps this one has a tad extra bitterness in finish but overall this is yet another very solid brew from Lagunitas.","  rDev Bottle into a Tallgrass Tulip. A: Golden tangerine, big head. Looks good. S: Best thing about this one. Pineapple, mango, pepper, clove, sweet malts, more citrus. T: Though everything is there, there's more and the whole doesn't quite match the excellence of the nose. Sweet malt, and then bitter medicinal hops, citrus, yeast on the finish that lingers and moderately dry. A little funk, but not much; spices and pepper too. M: moderate body, creamy, a bit of bite, moderately dry on the finish. Alcohol is pretty well hidden.

Comes in with 2/3  head. Aroma might be psychosomatic, but I swear I can pick up Liberty and Cascade hops.  Taste is them old school grapefruit and pine feels. Plenty of maltiness for it, but its dry and not heavy. Plenty of bitterness. This and Celebration ale are like drinking a time capsule. This keeps consistent throughout, first sip pretty much the same as the last sip.

I doubt you will find a beer on the market that really tastes like this. For that reason alone I would recommend at least trying it once just to experience the beer for what it is. It doesn't have a massive hop flavor that is often found in American style IPA's but the flavors are good and that is what counts.

The pour to this was light, topped with sudsy foam, and hardly left any lacing behind - which is pretty much what I expected from something of this sort. Deep raspberry, dank vegetables, hints of wild yeast, and wheat were in the nose as the taste was just as deep and varied as the nose indicated. Lots of tomato juice, raspberry seed, wet earthiness, and celery juice came in as this warmed up, which made this quite deeper than your typical brew of the sort. Very little tartness could be found here as this was like a vegetable-leaning IPA without the hops and with a slicker mouthfeel. If it was possible to combine fruit and vegetables into a soup and ferment it, this would be the end result.  Of course, this was a session beer and quite easy to get down. If I had gumbo and jambalaya here or some crawfish and po' boy sandwiches, this would be the brew that I'd want to wash them down with.

The body of Purple Haze is a light to medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. This brew would go nice on a hot summer day or with lunch. The mouth feel is Bold, Raspberry, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Purple Haze a 3.75 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Abita Brewing Co., Did a real nice job with this brew. If you are looking for something different, I would give this one a try.","  rDev Bottle:  Low C (2.80) / AVERAGE","  rDev A - Pours a lightly hazed amber with a one finger foamy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.  S - Aroma raspberry and pilsner malts.  T - The taste follows the aroma. Raspberry, pilsner malts and a subtle hop bite.  M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Soft mouthfeel with a crisp dry finish.  O - Nothing spectacular just a nice easy drinking beer.","  rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a nonic pint glass; no production information evident. A: Pours a very hazy light plum or rose amber color with a half inch, foamy white head, spotty retention (not quite just a rim), and very limited lacing. S: Floral, rose water aroma clarifying to raspberry. Definitely a light malt aroma and some grassiness. More sour note, as warms. T: Dry. Tastes like a Pilsner adulterated by unsweetened raspberry flavoring. I do not get even a hint of the wheat. Bitterness peppery, like strawberry pips, but that does contribute to a more crisp, refreshing quality than is common in the style. Definitely drinks best when it has warmed a bit. M: Light to medium bodied with solid carbonation. O: I think this was a nice attempt at a dry, raspberry fruit beer. Drinkable, but I do not think the flavor elements quite work together.","  rDev nice fine white head pretty stable. some haze to it orange with a read hue. lots of carbonation smells is a combination of raspberry with a little metallic and Pilsener sweetness.  taste is crisp Pilsner malt and hops with a dose of raspberry sirup and a tang from the wheat malts. refreshing, thin to medium body, lots of carbonation I do not find anything wrong with this beer it is well crafted but I do not think that raspberry and Pilsner style are a good match. Interesting to taste though.","  rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass. freshness dating was right over the raised Abita on the bottle, but able to detect best by March 2018.   cloudy dull pink grapefruit colored body. small white head leaving little in the way of lacing.  hit of tart raspberry on the nose, but mostly lager.  raspberries do come through on the taste, but then the lager overwhelms it. The balance here is non to pleasant to this particular palate.  Mouth is somewhere between thin and medium, finish is lagery and slightly dry on the tip of the tongue.  Overall, not a brew i enjoyed. I like raspberries in beer, but in this base lager, it doesn't seem to work well.","  rDev Had it on tap in a plastic cup at the French Quarter Acme Oyster House in New Orleans. It went fine with my charbroiled oysters and jambalaya. Subtle berry flavor. It looked fine in the plastic cup, good lacing. I would order it again in the French Quarter.","  rDev Review #2500... certainly not a whale but easily a mainstay and somewhat legendary in its own right; so why not?  A- Stubby 12oz pours into a becher glass with a strawberry to orange hue. The beer itself is filled with what I am assuming are small flecks of fruit or yeast; truly chunky pour. The cap is off-white rising to about a finger high with a thick foamy consistency. Fairly good retention and lacing forms with some wide sheets.  S- Raspberries, what a surprise. The good thing is they come of as fairly fresh and bright without any awkward clashing with the base lager. Slight bread and pale barley and overall it comes off like a raspberry yogurt or donut.  T- Just about everything is dialed back here as it feels very diluted and watered down with just a tiny hint of raspberry. The ratio is changed as the base toasty grains grow and so does some lager yeast qualities. Almost tastes like a seltzer here to be honest. A standard pale lager with a hint of raspberry, bread and sweetness. Some leafy touch from the fruit.  MF- Light end body with just a bit of foamy texture to it. As mentioned above it comes off as rather watery and thin; the entire experience is like diluted beer.  I respect this beers place in history and just how immense of a presence it seems to have in certain beer markets but in the end it tastes and feels rather dilute. The aroma starts off with intense fresh raspberries but that fades out before the glass is empty. Clean lager with a hint of raspberries and a thin body. Here's to another 2500!","  rDev Pours slightly hazy reddish orange-amber with thin off-white head, leaving a narrow ring of lacing.   Smells like raspberry.....something. Dried raspberries? Raspberry yogurt? Raspberry-flavored filling in a jelly doughnut. That's it!. Nothing else noticeable.  Flavor is light pils/basic lager bready malt, a mild touch of (unsweetened) raspberry, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. Thankfully, not cloying, or particularly sweet, as I was expecting.  Feel is thin watery/oily, with very fine, light carbonation.   Overall, not horrible, but I don't expect to have it again. A gift, among other beer, from a friend, or I might never have tried it. A step above AALs, but a small one. ;)","  I expected this to be purple, instead it pours a reddish orange color. Ah well.  Smell is fruity and fresh, a bit of raspberry. Very summery.  Taste is of a fruited lager, not very deep, but very refreshing. Fresh rapsberries and a bit of lime.  The liquid is thin, with prickly carbonation, easy to chug.  I bought this mainly to tick Louisiana, but I enjoyed this for what it is, a refreshing summer beer!","  rDev Orange/Amber color with a sweet slightly fruit aroma. The taste is more subtle than the smell,not too sweet at all nor over powerful fruit taste.

Pours a light reddish blonde with a raspberry aroma. Very light bodied beer with raspberry flavor. Light wheat on the finish with more light fruit. Not a whole lot special going on with this one.","  rDev I've always liked this brew. Obviously the name gets in my brain, but it's a unique beer that works.  It's really pretty in the glass, with tiny bubbles and lace. The aroma is a balanced wheaty yeasty, hoppy, but mostly fruity smell.  The taste is similarly balanced. Light and easy drinking, it's slightly dry and lightly sweet. It's very refreshing and satisfying. The aftertaste is very clean. This will go well with food.  Purple Haze is not like it's namesake acid - it won't mess you up, but you won't have the serious regret either. Recommended for a light treat.","  rDev From the bottle, it pours a hazy golden amber with a beautiful off-white head. Raspberry and wheat malt in the nose. The mouth is assaulted by the raspberry flavor along with the wheat malt.

Nose is caramel malts, honey, mango, a floral note, and maybe a hint of maple syrup. Apple as well. The taste is super smooth and crisp. Malts, bread, grass, granny smith apples, honey, toffee, mango, pineapple, and a bitter leather note at the end. This is very nice and full of depth. Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp.

The head recedes lazily, leaving sheets of lacing. It is a great looking beer in the footed pilsner glass.  Rich malty aroma, strongly bread with fruit and spice backing.  Taste is bread to the fore, as promised by the aroma. Behind that is an herbal flavor, along with fruit and pepper. There is little in the way of bittering at the front, a bit sweet initially, and it remains smooth through the middle, with a tanginess from the hops showing itself. The hoppy tang dries things out a bit by the finish. The aftertaste is bready, with a nice mouth-coating feel. The finish is sufficiently dryish so as to demand the next drink. I really like the bready aftertaste.  Mouth feel has a moderate body, smooth.

S: Aromas of honey suckle, pumpkin, apple, peanut, and (light) spice (esp cinnamon). Vinous toward the end. More peppery as it warms.

Aroma was doughy, yeast, cracker and malt . Behind that there was a floral, grassy hop aroma Taste is very identical to aroma . The malt dominates the flavor but not to the point of being a sweet malt bomb. If anything this is as far as I prefer to have the malts dominate, adds flavor and a bit of sweetness but allows other flavors to show up. The doughy, yeast, cereal taste follows the malt and then there's a dry, mild, bitterness that lingers a bit works really well.

The beer pours bright very light amber with khaki colored head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves some splotchy lacing. The aroma is bready balanced by spicy and floral hops. The taste is semisweet bready malts again balanced by a grassy, spicy hop note. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. The malt sweetness and hop bitterness interact throughout each phase of this beer where neither is ever completely missing. Overall, excellent. This is a tasty beer and fits the style description nearly to a tee.","  rDev Bottle. I have REALLY been looking forward to trying this. It has eluded me for literally a decade. Haphazardly got to try it and was a bit disappointed. It's pretty tasty. Richer, and deeper in color and sweetness than expected. Overall though, I thought it was merely a good beer. This rather high consensus rating I think is Beeradvocate users' universal approval of the Great Lakes brand.","  rDev Very nice lager, well-balanced and flavorful. Nice golden color with a little head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of malt, grain, caramel and just a little hops.

Honey gold in color with a few fingers of foam. Aroma is nice and bready, warm, crusty bread and floral and grassy hops. Flavor is quite fantastic and complex, with bready malt, grain, honey, biscuit, floral and grassy hops competing for attention. Finish is a bit zippy, and dries on the tongue.","  rDev Bottle from Giant. Nice rich golden color, clear, initial foamy head fades to skin. Nice grainy, grassy aroma, hay. Taste even moreso, smooth, grains prevalent, slightly sweet, Beautiful malty flavors, a bit sticky, which coast the tongue and makes the flavors linger. Nice!","  rDev It comes in a clear copper color with a tight foamy white head. Fairly good retention, as the head does die after a minute, but leaves a solid film that leaves plenty of lacing behind.  It smells like tart red apple, toasted bread, some honey, and lightly grassy hops.  The taste follows the nose. Toast and honey lead the way upfront, with some floral hop action. Hints of vanilla in there as well. Tart red apple and pear are quite prominent. A solid grassy bitterness provides balance, but the emphasis leans decidedly toward the malt. It tastes a lot like their Märzen, albeit less sweet, or with more hop balance.  It's well-carbonated, smooth, slightly creamy, and fairly clean and crisp. There's just a touch of residual sweetness.  Overall, it's perhaps a touch more sweet than I prefer, but I like it a lot more than their Märzen. It's pretty darn well made, actually. I could probably crush a few cold pints of this in the summertime.","  rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Label Best By Date is '02/28/18'. Pale gold colored body, clear.

Spicy noble hop flavor comes in as well. Swallow is more caramel and biscuit with some lingering spicy hop and a little fruitiness. M: This beer has a body that is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is adequate and sits below prickly while the beer has a slightly drying finish. O: Overall this one is pretty good. Nice flavors and some decent complexity.

Pours with a clear dark amber body topped by durable head.  Hop forward and moderately bitter flavor.  Overall: hoppy for style?","  rDev Wow, the most accurate representation of  gold  I've seen in a beer. Just unfathomable clarity, and beautiful color. 1 finger head of soapy and frothy qualities.   Aromas of honey, dill, golden malts, some day old bread.   Flavor is impressive to say the least. Tons of white bread, some great herbal (basil, thyme, oregano), and some golden malts, then some really nice noble sharp hop character comes in. As it warms the dill gets louder, but overall the flavor profile on this beer is quite decent.   Carbonated like a Miller High Life, just super drinkable and somewhat crispy.   Overall, Great Lakes' Dort is just an oustanding example, and while it's not my style, it's perhaps the best in its class. For that reason, I'm rating it a 4.5 overall as being best, or basically close to best in its class. Also - DRINK IT COLD!!","  rDev L- Pours a wonderful, darker gold with a one-finger, fluffy, white head. Plenty of carbonation. Head sticks around. S- Wonderful bready and honey smell. T- Nice bready taste up front and in the finish. Sweet presence of honey that transitions into some hop bitterness. Quite a bit happening here. F- Nice creaminess that is expected with the style.  O- Top notch lager. Complexities were unexpected. wonderful.","  rDev This stuff looks pretty much like your standard AAL BMC type of lager, which is not bagging on it, because they make those things so consistent and with ample clarity. Very nice. Aroma is muted and speaks of mainly grain. Has that steeped grain hot water vibe.  Taste is easy. Its a well made beer, but at the same time I don't get the neckbeard adoration for it. Its like a counter culture well I'm not into huge beers kind of hipster thing. Plenty of carbonation, noble hop zest. Probably hopped a little higher than traditional but its all good. Its a good beer with a cult like following. Decent enough when you're wanting to drink beer rather than share and write geek notes.","  rDev lear orange/gold beer with a short white head that leaves a few specks of lacing behind.

Quite a nice beer.","  rDev Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours golden yellow with a fluffy white head. Smells of sweet wheat and slight banana.

(yet another) success for the Great Lakes guys, that 5.8% ABV sticks a stronger edge to the session lager...","  rDev Serving: Bottle   Clear golden straw with two fingers white puff settles to patchy film some foamy lace. Bready with a slight hop bite and the aroma flavor follows suit. Ridiculously clean, very drinkable, herbal finish that compliments the breadiness of the flavor and presses you for another swig.

The funny part is that I’ve drunk so many beers now I sometimes think I’ve had a beer before and I recommend it to people without realising that in fact I haven’t actually had it before - this is one of those beers. I could have sworn I reviewed it and gave it an 8/10 or something along those lines. Oh well, I love Oatmeal Stouts, so I’ll probably end up giving it an 8/10 anyhow. I don’t get the Shakespeare reference, was he partial to Oatmeal Stouts? I don’t even think the style existed in his time. Whatevs.  Poured from a 650ml bomber bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Straight off the mark it looks viscous - like old engine oil (the real thing, not the brew by Harviestoun... which used to be more viscous back in the day when it was 9% ABV!). Deep black body with a mocha-coloured head that recedes leaving a thin lace ring... oh well, average head but looks syrupy, that’s all that matters. 8/10.  S: Cheeky fruity hop notes mingle with a chocolate and coffee combo that never gets old - I love a good Stout! Earthy red coffee cherry character with a hint cigar tobacco sweetness. Not quite world-class but bloody moreish nonetheless. Moreish/10... which I guess translates to: 8/10.  T: Just an excellent, easy-drinking Oatmeal Stout. Nothing extraordinary - just solid and dependable, a Land Rover of Stouts this is [I’ll take a LR over a Jeep any day of the week]. Flavours are similar to the above with notes of: Earthy/floral hops, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of tobacco leaf and a whisper of smoke. Aftertaste has a lingering bitterness, it’s not sharp but it does mar the flavour just a touch. 8/10.  M: Medium, almost heavy bodied with a soft/dense carbonation. Nowhere near Founders in stature and body, however it’s got enough heft to be considered a real Oatmeal Stout... I do wonder how Founders get so much body in their beers... but I digress. 7/10.  D: After the average-at-best-but-really-that’s-just-a-nice-way-of-saying-crap Milk Stout by Brouhaha it’s comforting to drink an Oatmeal Stout that ticks all the boxes - it’s not quite as good as Rogue’s own Chocolate Stout (I do quite like that one!), this is just good, a good example of the style, quite acceptable and drinkable, tasty even. So there. What where? There? There. 8/10.  Food match: In keeping with the Shakespeare theme: Roasted game meats n’ stuff.","  rDev Bottle from Albertsons. Dark and smoky, roast grains and chocolate.

Flavour is similar; more resin and earthy noble hops come across on the finish but it is a pretty balanced roasty and sweet milk chocolate brew with a nice bitterness on the backend, but not what I would call hoppy like Storm King. Not particularly bitter, but really just very balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, rich and appropriate for a cold evening. I can see why this was considered a game winner once upon a time, but it would seem that it has been surpassed, and for a long time.","  rDev This beer pours a simple black with a good sized head. The aroma offers up chocolate, dark fruit, smoke, and sawdust. The flavor is lead by roasty malts, a fairly strong smokey quality, dark chocolate, plum, with a very dry finish.

Taste really hits the chewy and smooth notes, there's plenty of roast there, but it isn't acrid or bitter. The hopping is ample here, but never elevating itself beyond the malt. The format in a bomber is a little excessive price per oz wise, but its a solid beer.","  rDev 12 oz. bottle, no bottled on date present. Finally getting around to reviewing this one from Rogue, acquired a single bottle of this stuff from the local bottle shop. Bottle doesn't really have much to say on this one - no abv listed either.  Poured into a Unibroue Maudite snifter.  A - Pours a thick dark inky blackish-brown body, super dark and close to opaque, especially for being an under 6.00% abv beer, the color is very impressive. One finger of thin bubbly mocha head that dies down to a bubbly ring quickly, leaving minor spotty lacing. Appears aptly carbonated. Looks very nice.  S - Aroma is rich, dark, bitter, &amp; roasty. Huge notes of chocolate / cream / barley malt roastiness, lightly charred &amp; ashy. Slight notes of mineral water, &amp; dark pitted fruits.  T - Taste follows the nose: dark bitter, roasty, malty, chocolatey, with lots of burnt black coffee &amp; ashy char in the taste. Again, slight notes of mineral watery &amp; dried raisins / figs / dates. It's ok. Not particularly flavorful or interesting, for my liking.  M - Feel is smooth &amp; creamy. Body is light &amp; actually pretty watery for my liking. Lots of dark bitter burnt malts, black coffee, &amp; raisins in the aftertaste.  Overall, it was okay. I thought it was average all around, and a bit too thin and bitter for my liking.   Rogue Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout -----3.5/5","  rDev Rogue Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout, 5.8% ABV, 69 IBU. Pours medium to thick, black, with 4+ fingers of head, lots of lacing. Nose is malty sweetness and coffee, taste is malt, strong coffee, moderately bitter coffee close. Real nice mouthfeel. Overall a decent oatmeal stout, though could be a bit less bitter for my taste.","  rDev Dark espresso coffee color with small tan cap.  Aroma of roasted malt and dark toffee.  Coffeeish flavor of dark roasted malt. It's not a one trick pony, rather just tilted that way. Some hops appear mid palate but show little presence. Roasted bitterness in the aftertaste.  Full, creamy texture with good balancing carbonation.  For me the balance is tilted toward roast bitterness which is singing solo and louder than all the rest combined. Fine for those who like that, our resident Guinness fan loves this stuff.","  rDev Listed in the  1001 Beers,  I will review it when I have it again. Also reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic  300 Beers To Try Before You Die! ","  Poured in a pint glass, color is dark brown head is tan, head presents about 1/2 inch thick.   Smell is simple, clean: nice roasted malt, smooth oatiness, light chocolate.  Taste is better than the aroma with a clean and smooth flavor, nice simple balance of oat, roast, and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is great, crisp ale carbonation with well balanced and lingering flavors.  Overall, a great, easy drinking beer.","  rDev ** 03/17/12 Earthy Chocolaty Aroma, not too strongDecent Tan Head, dark black color.Bittersweet chocolate notes, with stiches of sour fruit, cherry, raisins.smoothGave my only Guiness to my Wife to drink on St. Patricks Day; but I am not feeling Jealous. ** 03/13/13 Slightly Superior head to head with Rogue Chocolate Stout. **","  rDev How curious that I have not reviewed this beer until now! I think that part of it was a reluctance on my part o open a 22-fl. oz. bomber by myself. Certainly, I am capable of drinking the whole thing, but it just seems selfish. I picked up this reasonable 12-fl. oz. bottle recently at The Fridge.  From the bottle:  Dedicate to the Rogue in Each of Us ;  100% Pure Rogue ;  World Champion Stout .  After Pop!ping the cap, I decided to go with a heavy-handed pour. This raised three-plus fingers of dense, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with great retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing cola highlights only at the edges. Nose was roasty, chocolaty and with a molasses/treacle bite. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was soft &amp; creamy, but not overly carbonated. Instead, the liquid itself seemed to be like a dollop on my tongue. Mmmm. The taste was a little more bitter than I had expected, closer to black coffee and/or bittersweet chocolate than the nose had suggested. Finish was semi-sweet, slightly smoky, lingering with notes of coffee &amp; dark chocolate. It strikes me as more of a dessert beer than one just to drink on its own, but that is me.","  rDev 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours almost black with a small tan head that fades leaving great retention and solid lacing. The aromas are awesome, especially for a  smaller stout . Tons of chocolate syrup. Some caramel in the mix as well. The flavors have alot of roasted malts. More chocolate with hints of coffee. Nice bitterness. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is light with very active carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink.  This is a classic Rogue brew. It's nice to see it in 12oz bottles now. Great example of a traditional oatmeal stout.","  rDev Undated 22 oz bomber into pint glass. Pours an opaque brown with a thin tan head. Initial impression is smooth roasted malts with a slight earthy hoppiness and a strong chocolate finish. Not particularly sweet, although it certainly isn't bitter. Kind of a dark chocolate or coffee with cream sort of thing, I guess. Medium/oily mouthfeel, with just about the right carbonation. Moderate ABV allows you to appreciate the subtleties of the beer. Good offering - I'd try again!"]}]
