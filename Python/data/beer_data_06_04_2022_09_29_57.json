            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle\nGlass: snifter\nServing Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)\n\n\nLook: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.\n\nSmell: Dark-roasted Columbian coffee with a large dose of bittersweet chocolate.\n\nTaste: Pretty much the same as it smells. Coffee. Lots of coffee. With notes of bittersweet chocolate and some earthy bitterness. The coffee and earthiness linger into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not noticed.\n\nFeel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.\n\nOverall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times. This one is a bit more bitter than I remember, but that's likely because this is the freshest Breakfast Stout that I have had in a while. I have mostly been having them at 1+ years old. At that age, the chocolate takes center stage and the coffee is the supporting act.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A - Dark brown / black pour with bubbly, creamy, toffee colored lacing.\n\nS - Big chocolate and coffee roast aroma along with some char.\n\nT - Follows the nose to a &quot;T&quot;. Coffee roast and chooclate char dominate this beer from start to finish along with some coffee bean and Espresso underneath. Ends with a lingering chocolate coffee char on the back side with some toast cocoa popping up at the very back end.\n\nM - Big medium to full body with just a slight bit of thinness around the edges.\n\nO - This beer continues to be fantastic, not sure what took me so long to review this after drinking it for years. (As I scratch my head.)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - June 2021 batch poured in January 2022 from a bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50- 55 degrees. 3/4ths of a finger light tan head. The beer is extremely dark and opaque. The head leaves a nice lacing that lasts for longer than most.\n\nS - Disclaimer. I actively dislike coffee. (Yes, even the smell.) This beer hits with coffee up front, but I knew that going into it and wanted to try a well-regarded beer anyway. Then I get a dark bitter chocolate. There are some oats in there, and finally just a general roast smell. \n\nT - Coffee is first, with some bitter dark chocolate next. I get a hint of a cola flavor. Interestingly enough, the coffee fades and the flavors just smooth out into each other. Then there's a small coffee finish. Absolutely not hoppy bitterness. The only bitter flavor is from the coffee/cocoa flavor. There is a little roastiness in the finish as well.\n\nF - This is a medium feel, but a little thinner than expected from such a dark beer. Decent carbonation. Actually, there is a nice mild fizz in there. Exquisitely smooth.\n\nO - Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev There is a time and a place for this beer. It is fantastic though. Higher ABV and you can taste that. Jet black color, with a short mocha colored head. Coffee, dark chocolate, and oatmeal flavors, maybe even some slight slight notes of turmeric. Had some bitterness. You have to be in the mood for this beer, but it sure is quality that’s for sure.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: dark black color with a thick one inch foam at the surface.\nSmell: Getting a lot of roasty chocolate, coffee notes. Smelling really good!\nTaste: huge chocolate taste followed by coffee. The end is roasty, and dry with a smooth finish. Wow!!!!! This stout is THE BEST stout I've ever had being so smooth, rich of chocolate - not to sweet but just enough. Maybe even big notes of cocoa now that I think about it.\nFeel: Medium to full bodied with very little carbonation on the tongue. \nOVerall: Definitely going to be buying this at least once a month. This has upgraded and became my favorite beer of all time!!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev For a non barrel aged beer this one is incredible. The best best barrel aged beer I had so far was tweak from Avery brewing. Surely Tweak is better than this beer but that is because it was aged in Bourbon barrels and it costs a lot more. But still, these two beers are similar in many ways on how it coats your mouth and the taste lingering long after even a small sip. I can’t believe this is just a stout. Absolutely incredible!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz. bottle dated 12/3/21 enjoyed in a nonic tumbler \n\nPours opaque ebony with one finger tan head. Full curtain lacing and surface cap. \nCoffee, chocolate, light roast malt aromas.\nCoffee, cocoa, light hop fruitiness, cinnamon flavors .\nSmooth full mouthfeel, no alcohol heat, light sweet fruit aftertaste. Flavors bloom slightly as the glass warms.\nTicks all the boxes for a coffee stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I was itching to try a good stout recently. I heard that Founders Breakfast Stout was fantastic. I decided to give it a shot.\n\nPoured from the bottle into a wide-mouth tulip.\n\nLooks - Like coffee. Medium roast cold-brew is very much what this looks like. Has a light brown head, very creamy and soft looking. Nice and thick\n\nSmell - Like various coffee roasts, dried fruits (stone fruits, cherries), and a lighter dark cocoa scent come through.\n\nTaste - A bit underwhelming, I'll say. It isn't bad...but it comes through with a strong coffee flavor..however, it is more in line with the after-taste of coffee which comes across as more bitter than I'd want. Some dried fruits come through as well which is more enjoyable before cascading into deep dark chocolate that is almost exactly like eating a 100% cocoa chocolate bar. A bit of alcohol burn on the finish that isn't too strong and easy to miss. Some spiciness in the beer as well that is hard to place.\n\nFeel - Thick, creamy, smooth. A very nice mouthfeel.\n\nOverall, I think I expected more than I got from this. While it was good, I was missing some more hutzpa to this. I appreciated the cocoa, but I think the coffee notes were too bitter and didn't pair well with the already bitter cocoa. The mouthfeel was absolutely spectacular though. I have three more bottles of this and I will try this brew in a proper stout glass next to see if the taste improves. I'm also not too much of a fan of oatmeal mash brew. I've always been underwhelmed when trying beers brewed with oatmeal, so this could be the culprit. I did enjoy it thoroughly though!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of the if not the best stouts ever made.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Finally got to taste this (kosher reasons.)\n\nVery good. Reasonably priced. Hint of chocolate. ABV well hidden. \n\nWorth having.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev What can I say that hasn't been said? Near black pour with thin mocha head. Not much lacing. Smell is roasty toasty malt. Coffee flavors throughout the sips from start to finish. Medium viscosity and very mild carbonation. It's really good...Really good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a thick long lasting foan that caps a most black stout. \nMedium carbonation. \nToasted cocoa and coffee beans notes, with prevalent charred grains flavors. \nHeavy on the palate. \nSweet and bitter aftertaste.\nPairs wonderfully with meat pies, game or red meat roasts and of course with a German Chocolate Cake.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours jet black with a thin tan head that rapidly evaporates - contrary to the back label description.\nNose is French roast coffee that almost completely overpowers the roast malt and dark chocolate beneath. Hints of fig and crushed walnut.\nPalate follows with burnt coffee dominating. Grahm cracker, maple, dark chocolate and nutmeg.\nMedium mouthfeel and creaminess imparted by the oatmeal.\nWay too much coffee for my palate, dominates the beer and lends an unpleasant bitterness from the dark roast. Not a balanced or integrated brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Black, opaque, with mahogany around the edges. Half a finger head that dissipates fairly quickly.\n\nSmell: Loads of chocolate and coffee. Sweet cocoa powder.\n\nTaste: Tastes like it smells. Strong coffee flavor with large notes of chocolate. Coffee is not overly bitter. Dark fruits. Hop bitterness comes through on the finish. \n\nFeel: Mouthfeel is not as thick as some imperial stouts but there is body here.\n\nOverall: A good easy drinking stout. A nice balance. Dominant flavors are from the added ingredients, like the chocolate and coffee. Almost a desert beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bought at AH Wezenberg Antwerp. They do try to get some rare new brews on a regular basis.\nServed in my usual tumbler.\nColour is black. Head never really develloped. Same brown lacing.\nScent is mellow and rich: lot's of cold coffee, fruit (pear, grapes and dates), cereals (oat and mais), sigar ashes and chocolate cake.\nFlavour again is rich and mellow. strong and silky smooth at the same time. Smoked grain, coffee ground and dark chocolate, full cream with maple syrip poured over. Not a lot of carbonation present.\nThe aftertaste gives some more dry and bitter hops. Astringant chocolate, with granola with full cream. resembles more liquor. Thinking of Sheridans and Amarula. \n\nMy best sweet stout to date. I can't believe how full, rich and flavourfull this beer is. Not for those who prefer subtlety.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Black. Can't see any light through it. About a thumb of khaki colored head. Tight bubbles.\n\nSmell: Sour, chocolate, rye, coffee, butterscotch, brown sugar.\n\nTaste: Malted milk balls, booze, burnt brownie edge. Raisin and coffee come through as it warms.\n\nFeel: Medium bodied, smooth. Nice bit of alcohol warmth. I like more body in my stouts.\n\nOverall: I like it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into dimpled seidel. Cola dark with a khaki head (&quot;cinnamon&quot; colored according to the bottle). Head becomes a lingering ring.\n\nNose is sweet roast.\n\nTaste is smooth sweet over a lightly bitter coffee-dark chocolate roast. Finish is a little boozy. \n\nAdequate carbonation for a smooth, creamy experience. \n\nGreat beer. Balanced and rich. Founders has bigger, bolder stouts, but this one's an old favorite."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can best by date June 2022 into a pint glass.\nL: Pours almost crystal clear amber w/a 1&quot; pock marked creamy off white head w/decent retention to a creamy skin. Random lacing and some sticky sheeting.\nS: Caramelized malts, grassy hops, orange zest, a hint of bread. It is pungent, fruity &amp; floral.\nT: Citrus zest, black tea, caramelized roasty malts, grapefruit, fruit cake, grassy hops, lemon drop candy, a suggestion of brown bread, moderate alcohol. It is somewhat tart w/pine resin in a med-long linger. Powerful malts, bold hops and is full flavored.\nF: Sharp, firm &amp; smooth med-heavy bodied mouth feel that is lightly sticky and almost thick. It has a rather drying finish.\nO: A full flavored American Imperial IPA that truly delivers an enthusiastic and unrestrained dense punch of malts &amp; hops. It's taste is BIG and it is excellent in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wouldn’t turn it down but…I’ve had better",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IP Glass. Two finger off-white head. Pours golden and hazy. Decent lacing.\n\nS - Bitter citrus and floral IPA scent\n\nT - Taste is more complex than scent. Has some maltiness to balance the bitter floral and citrus. Very balanced for an IPA. Each taste goes back and forth between malt and hop.\n\nF - Nice medium oily feel.\n\nO - Top notch IPA. Drank the same night as 60 Min IPA. Both are wonderful beers that are definitely in my annual rotation. The 60 Minute is the IPA standard for me. This 90 Minute is a great premium version with more complexity.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by Jul 2022. Drinking feb 24 2022. Room temperature.\n\nL: amber body, off white 2 finger head that becomes a ring. Good lacing.\n\nS: mostly tropical fruit, some pine, a hint of malt. \n\nT: a nice piney bitterness, grapefruit tartness, a touch of sweetness, and a bittersweet hoppy roasted malt finish.\n\nF: a full viscous body, similar to a good barrel aged stout. Creamy and coats the tongue. Beautiful execution for a dipa.\n\nO: an above average ipa in every aspect. The mouth feel was my favorite part, but there were no major weaknesses. Definitely a better ipa for malt centric beer lovers. Probably better options out there if you like pine sol flavored beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Gorgeous copper orange color with a very thin crackly white head. \n\nSmell: Beautiful hop aroma. Mango, pineapple, fresh cut grass and a little bit of pine sap.\n\nTaste: Grapefruit up front, plenty of herbal and grassy notes follow. Bitterness is there but it isn't unpleasant. Malt is doing a great job balancing all those hops. There's some bread crust and a really nice toasted note that lingers on. \n\nFeel: Medium bodied. Plenty of carbonation. Chewy but refreshing. I can't feel any alcohol warmth at all. \n\nOverall: This is one of the best Imperial IPA's I've had. Thank you, Dogfish Head.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 19. 2 ounce can. Never mind the impressive for me off-white head and hazy deep golden hue, the aroma and taste were cursed by what I believe is some kind of malt extract. very artificial tasting which for me, ranks this beer below most Malt liquors. Maybe the Can recipe is different from the six pack recipe? Extremely disappointed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A great balance of hops with the sweet malt base. The warming nature of this beer just mellows you out. By far one of the the best beers by Dogfish Head. There is nothing better than working a hard day and chillin with a 90 minute.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I really wanted to like this, but just couldn't get into it. Taste was just a bit too weird. Something about the maltiness that didn't sit right. And a little too... syrupy. I have heard it needs to age, so storing a few and will check back later.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nDense yellow-gold with a humongous, off-white head that laces in oblong strands.\n\nBouquet:\nDry pine needles, dehydrated orange peel and a unique sweetness that hits like mild pineapple and lemon drops sunken in a deep pool of amber malts.\n\nFeel:\nTouches down like an American strong ale fortified with luscious hop oils. Low but unyielding carbonation whets the citrus and hop bitters present.\n\nTaste:\nA hard edge of bitter hops tempered by a thick quilt of malts sweetened with fructose and a few scant drops of table syrup. A length of dry, hoppy heat in the linger.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bitter, hoppy and malty.\nReally rare flavor profile in a IPA. Malt!\nSteady rocky foam. \nOrange peel color.\nLong lasting acorn aftertaste.\nPure amazingness!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Never have been a big fan of the imperial IPA, but this is different. The flavor profile is that of a lighter IPA, but still kicks you in the teeth at 9%. For the high alcohol, it’s very drinkable and I think I like the smoother, more tropical taste this has over the 60min version. Probably don’t need more than one of those, but I’ll sip the hell out of the signal.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I really wanted to like this, but can’t get past the malty sweetness. Drank fresh although I couldn’t tell by the taste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Been drinking the 90 since at least 2003 and have never been disappointed, whether on tap or out of the bottle. From the appearance and aroma to the intense hop taste, it has been an affordable, reliable, exemplary model of the style. Could keep on gushing about it but I'll just sit back and continue guzzling instead.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'll never understand this beer. I discovered it way back around the year 2000. Back then this beer actually tasted like fresh hops, that's why I was amazed by it. It was one of the first imperial IPAs that I tried. That version of this beer was very hoppy, fruity, and had bursts of citrus hop flavor. This current version is just too sweet and malty for my taste. Dog Fish Heads brewmaster at the time decided that this beer needed to be held back for a certain degree of time before it was actually distributed. That decision in my opinion was horrible. I have always had the impression that this brewmaster had no idea what a hop bomb was all about. I still feel that way now. This beer taste like more like an imperial Bluepoint toasted lager more than an imperial IPA. This beer is forever ruined even if it's only a week old, and I've actually had it that fresh. Malt bomb!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Never had a beer like this one before. No sir. I felt like I want to sleep on Mars but woke up on. Venus. Yeah, this one is powerful, but smooth like a Williams sister hitting a serve. This one is a winner like all the chicken dinners.\n\nSee ya.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I am not a lover of all things IPS. This one is unusually GOOD. Very hoppy- but does not have the overwhelming grapefruit juice flavor of many popular IPAs. Very strong malt flavors combne with the very nice (NOT all grapefruity) hop flavors. I was afraid to try it, but am glad I did. I'd love to compare it against Middle Ages &quot;Late Knight IPA, which is a similar style that I can enjoy",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Always love it!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Descent head that disappears. Dark golden almost copper color. Lots of tiny bubbles that add effervescence and freshness to rich mouth feel. An IPA imperial that is both very malty and hoppy at the same time. For a heavily hopped beer there is lots of flavor but not unpleasantly bitter as many an IPA can be. Wonderful stuff, 9% strong without tasting boozy."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of the better beers you can have. If you don’t like IPAs still give this a try",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great overall IPA \n\nL: pours golden/ light amber with a little over a finger of thick rocky foam. Hazy/cloudy\n\nS: citrus and hoppy pine are the strongest notes some malt \n\nT: following the smell I got a light of lemon water taste at colder temps and as it warmed up I got a nice hop bitterness and a good malt body. Overall pine and citrus are the strongest with a nice hint of spice and malt. \n\nF: perfect carbonation, good mouth feel. Definitely not watery but feels a little lighter than other IPAs I’ve had recently",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden with slight amber color and white fluffy cap. Subtle back notes of spice, cinnamon, and grapefruit give this huge IPA an incredibly unique signature punch without throwing the hop forward ipa out of balance from its nicely layered malty backbone. Amazing IPA brew!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Being from Michigan I always just considered Two Hearted another option besides your Buds and Millers, albeit a slightly more expensive and tasty brew. It was the beer we had our older siblings buy us when we had something to celebrate (or lament). \n\nNow that I'm older and my pallet is more refined I find myself always returning to this old staple. For some reason I still expect to try some new (to me) IPA and be blown away by how much better it is than Two-Heart. Well, I've tried quite a few and so far nothing has surpassed or even equaled the Michigan masterpiece that is Bell's Two-Hearted.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12oz bottle, dated 01/26/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.\n\nPours a crystalline honey-gold with two-plus fingers of fluffy white suds. Retention is exceptional - in fact, apparently infinite - with fat wads of foamy lacing.\n\nNose is malty, grainy, redolent of caramel sweetness.\n\nTaste is thoroughly in line with the nose. Tasting grapefruit peel and orange, a little vaporous pine in the sinuses but, more than anything else, overwhelming caramel malt sweetness. I get a little apple juice character in the finish and beyond which I’m attributing to the yeast(?)\n\nFeel is smooth and round, medium-dense bodied with ample carbonation.\n\nOverall, not well balanced to my palate, all malty-sweet smoothness with very little hop bite. Nothing wrong with it, per se, just not quite my cup of tea. I’ve waited a long, long time to find a (relatively) fresh bottle and I’m not going to lie, I’m a little disappointed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hardly a point to reviewing such an iconic beer. There's a zillion IPAs with colorful inscrutable labels and clever names. Some of them are great, most of them are serviceable, some are terrible. Then there's Two Hearted. Perfectly balanced, deceptively simple. Honestly I don't bother with other beers anymore unless I'm at a brewery.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint.\n\nThe look is very nice, everything I look for in a beer good 2 finger head, lacing, and decently strong carbonation. Color is a bit dark, maybe a light golden amber. Some haze present. Head becomes rocky as it dissipates, bubbles not the finest. Head has stuck around at about half a finger the whole time I've been drinking.\n\nAroma is essentially benchmark IPA bitterness and pine at first followed by a slight mellowing into citrus/grapefruit in the hops. Some general beer smell hiding in the back, presumably malt and yeast mingling together underneath all the hops.\n\nTaste is similar to the smell with a kick of bitterness right at the front that sticks around, but nothing too intense. Some lemon or grapefruit juice vibes in the hops but some pine resin comes along with it. Centennial seems to be a very balanced hop. In the back is some mild light malts, but with a sort of sweetness to it. Very flavorful nothing muted about it. Decently malty compared to some IPAs out there.\n\nFeel is right where it should be for the ABV. Its a pretty heavy beer but not quite leather recliner heavy. Its a decent year round vibe with a nice weight to it. Head retention means a thicker creamier mouthfeel but also heavier in the belly.\n\nOverall, I'll stick with what I said earlier. Its a very nice benchmark IPA. Nothing really exciting other than the pure quality and freshness. You know what you're getting with this one, and despite only one hope its got fruit and bitter pine all at the same time. I'd still call it a &quot;west coast&quot; IPA",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light copper color with a bone white head.\n\nSmell: Little bit of pine, some grapefruit and a fair bit of fruity yeast. \n\nTaste: Much like the aroma. Grapefruit and pine followed by some gentle hop bitterness. Malt is equal parts sweet and toasty. Maybe a hint of graham cracker towards the finish. Fruity yeast aftertaste. Very well balanced.\n\nFeel: Medium bodied, slick, fair bit chewy but well carbonated. No complaints.\n\nOverall: I've only had this beer once before and I pretty much shied away from it for a few years until now. I wasn't expecting much but I can now see why so many love this beer. It's one of the most balanced IPA's I've tried. It's just flat out delicious and easy to drink. Great beer. Thank you, Bell's.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottled 12-22-21. Opened 2-13-22. 2+ finger off white head with amazing retention. Thick, fresh, and sticky lacing left behind. Orange amber IPA with ample carbonation visible and about 75% clarity. Floral nose with orange peel. Citrus, pine, and a phenomenal creamy malt sweetness that gives the finish some chew. Medium + body and carbonation. Moderate bitterness in a semi-sweet finish. Outstanding.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev yes! I got this! it is good. I will re rated it in the coming months because I drank it weeks ago. Bell's makes exceptionally delcious IPA.\n\nI need to put it up against Odell's in a blind taste test.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful orange color. Smell is light and sweet- honey, orange blossom, cracker malt, apricot, not like a typical ipa. Taste follows- orange peel, slightly bitter pine, honey, cracker malt, caramel, vanilla, more floral notes, and more orange. Wow- what a pleasant beer. I can see why it’s so popular.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light amber with a 1/2&quot; white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing. Slight haze.\n\nAroma of grapefruit, orange, pine, spice.\n\nTaste is sticky pine, grapefruit zest, orange, caramel, resinous.\n\nMedium body, lively carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.\n\nOne of the best American made IPA's.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Clear amber-yellow color with a generous-sized foamy off-white head that slowly faded. A good looking IPA.\n\nSmell: Mild pine aromas along with some perfume like aromas.\n\nTaste: True to the nose I get mild pine notes, mild fruit notes followed by some bitter hop notes. I'm not sure of the date (not legible) but the nose and flavor profile suggest the beer is past its prime.\n\nMouth-feel: The beer is fairly light-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. \n\nOverall: The beer has no offensive flavors but considering how much I liked Double Two Hearted my suspicion tells me this one may be a bit past its prime."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Draft pint at the Anaheim Packing House. So excited to finally find this beer on draft. A very good beer but not the greatest IPA I’ve ever had. Very nice pine hop blast with a fine malt finish. A good solid 4.00 IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s a very good IPA. But it’s NOT a DIPA / Imperial and doesn’t even belong in the conversation. If it did, it sure as hell wouldn’t be in the top 25%. This might be the most overhyped beer on BA. Too bad because NoCal has the DIPA market flooded with excellent beers. This isn’t one of them, since it’s not a DIPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear light gold with a 1/2&quot; head of a mix of white small and larger bubbles. \n\nThe nose is deceiving as it's dominated by a bold dry hopped &quot;Cascade&quot; scent that is almost overpowering leading a first timer to expect a typically over-hopped, nothing-but-hops IPA. Happily that's not the case. \n\nThe magic here is the balance, something that so many IPA's get wrong. All the more remarkable for it being a double.\nMost stronger beers strike a balance with the strong hop aroma and flavor that results from aggressive dry hopping by starting with a high original gravity. This results is a sweet/tart balance that leans in the direction of a California style barley wine and is easy to get wrong. \n\nConsummate skill in the brewing arts yield something that I've never experienced before which is a very pleasing hop forward flavor profile with its resultant citrus / pine flavors, but still retaining the malt flavors, with no sweetness. This beer is just perfectly balanced. It really is a work of art. \n\nMedium body, carbonation strong enough to meet the stronger flavors, but not overwhelm them. Did I mention balance? \n\nIt's a bit much for a daily drinker for me, but there is no denying that it's a really exceptional beer, and an IPA I really enjoy which is a rarity. More remarkably its big brother Pliny the younger strikes an equally skillful balance in a triple. Hats off to Russian River Brewing, really fine work.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Yes. It is one of the best IPAs in Northern CA",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Lovely beverage, but not in my current style of preferred brews? Never cared for green anything in my beverages. Delicious, however, and better with my almost clear-broth chowder.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This was a long « want » of mine and I got the chance to finally sip on it thanks again to Beergoot.\n\nThis beer is very much deserving of its legend, classic and world class status. Exceptionally well crafted, balanced, hoppy and bitter. Strong ABV thats pretty well hidden here too.\n\nWhat can I say? No more. Find this beer. Drink it.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a pretty much clear light gold; beautiful white dense head with great retention; splotchy lacing. \n\nVery citrus forward aromas, some subtle sweet grainy aroma and some subtle dank. \n\nCitrus forward taste, just as the nose; gentle malt sweetness and littof sap. \n\nMedium body, gentle but plentiful carbonation, high and tongue coating bitterness that is nicely accentuated by a clean dry finish. \n\nThanks Dave for finally allowing me to try this iconic beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On Monterey bay watching the sunset. From a 510 mil bottled on Jan 22 2022. Hoppy dry. Refreshing full of flavor",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 1/28/22\n\nHoly hell, Pliny is finally mine! This is one of the first beers I heard about after joining BA, and I finally sourced 2 bottles, relatively fresh as well! I don't know what more to say, so let's just get into it\n\nPours a clear yellow gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing. An endless stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass\n\nOh man, the nose on this one isn't super complex, but it's right in your face. I'm picking up on aromas of resinous hops, caramel malt, fresh pine, orange zest, wildflower honey, and light white pepper\n\nThis is very expressive, but very balanced. There's nothing angular about this one; the beauty is in the balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange zest, floral hops, crackery malt, white pepper, pineapple, light honey, and tangerine. The swallow brings notes of caramel malt, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, honey, tangerine zest, and toasted grain\n\nA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and dry beer. Finishes totally dry and balanced\n\nOh man, this absolutely lived up to the hype for me! It's funny, because it's nothing crazy, but it's so well executed that it can't be denied as a world class beer. So happy I have another one to drink",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Tried on tap at The Grove in L.A. while on vacation with my son August 9th, 2021 @3:00pm. Glad I got to finally get this beer! $11 for 13 oz.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev At long last I finally got to try one of my bucket list beers - and it did not disappoint. Looked great with the lacing it had, was incredibly delicious to the nose, full-bodied to the mouth, and just as juicy to the taste. \n\nTruly a great beer, it was well worth the wait.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 3 weeks old. Bottle to IPA glass.\n\nLook: Pours a translucent golden brown with a thick and foamy white head. Some lacing. No floaters.\n\nSmell: Intense tropical sweetness paired with piney hop notes. \n\nTaste: Very piney. Very bitter. The tropical notes which dominated the smell pop up here and there in a very subtle, harmonious way. \n\nFeel: Crisp and clean. Perfect carbonation. Very crushable.\n\nOverall: Quintessential and style-defining. Even though the West Coast style is much more narrowly defined than its brother from New England, Pliny is as complex as might be. The interplay of sweetness and bitterness, tropical fruits and piney notes makes it a joy to drink.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12/15/2021 bottle from the brewery in Santa Rosa, CA. Pours a clear light yellow gold with a finger of rocky white head that sticks around, nice lacing, smell is citrus/pine/herbal, doughy brioche malts, musty pine cone, and candied grapefruit peel, taste is zesty candied grapefruit flesh, pine resin, big herbal and bitter grapefruit pith finish, feel is medium bodied, creamy carbonation. Incredibly balanced, lives up to the hype, the gold standard.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very golden color with that citrus hoppy smell with that classic &quot;dank&quot; pine in the smell and taste. The hop bitterness lingers with the pine forest dank scrubbing of the tongue tastes which I dont find in a lot of IPA's these days. The bitterness becomes astringent and quite powerful which a lot of IPA's have claimed but havent lived up to it. This comes closest to smelling and tasting a fresh hop you can get in a beer. Bottled only last month. Super Fresh.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Clear light orange with a formidable white head that forms a pillow and slowly craters, leaving sticky lacing coating the rim. A beautiful looking beer\nAroma: Pine, fir needles, citrus rind, tangelos, wafts of menthol, grapefruit, bready malt, and light sweetness\nTaste: Follows the nose well. Lots of conifer and citrus hit hard and fast upon first sip and mingle and develop nicely as malt sweetness holds down the base. Tongue and tooth-tingling menthol-like notes are present throughout as well and closes with a nice bite\nMouthfeel: Full, very clean, medium-high carbonation, and definite dryness on the finish\nOverall: This is tasty stuff. Not surprised in the least as to how good this is but it’s been over a decade since I had it last so was curious how I’d perceive it now with a much more developed palate. A classic WCDIPA hop profile – conifer and citrus but with a present, but restrained malt profile that lets the hops truly shine. The O.G. whale and still delicious",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drank 23 days after “bottled on” date. Great citrus fruit aroma. Pours straw color with thick lacy white head. Flavor matches aroma nicely, citrus, piney, pineapple finish. Nicely balanced, nothing overbearing. Just enough sweetness to cut bitter citrus. Medium mouth feel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I finally got to try this beer after years of searching. About the time I learned of its existence, Russian River quit distributing to my state. I think that if I had tried this beer years ago it would have rated a bit higher for me. With years of new breweries and beers popping up, it has greater competition and its rating has lowered for me. It is still one of my favorite west coast IPAs! I will never turn down the chance at getting some more of this great beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I drank this beer at whole foods while eating pizza with my lovely girlfriend and watching tom &amp; jerry. Also it was our first time eating out anywhere since covid times began. Under these conditions I would enjoy drinking near anything. But it wasn't anything that I was drinking: it was pliny the elder. The palate is bittersweet with resinous pine and orange zest, underpinned by a strong malt character. It is old hat to say this is an exemplar of the style (west coast IPA), but some things bear repeating.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev After leaving VT and the likes of The Alchemist and Hill Farmstead, I didn't know how I'd find happiness in northern California. As we explored the hikes and wineries of Sonoma/Marin, we quickly learned of Pliny the Elder. That's when things started to fall into place. Pliny is the perfect combination of flavor and gentle enjoyable drinking for beer lovers. Our favorite pairing was Tony's Pizza Napoletana (Tony Gemignani, North Beach, SF) with a Pliny the Elder. Mmmm...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good? Yes. Hype-machine? Yes. Deserved hype? Not a believer in hype machines. But it does tick all the boxes it is supposed to. Nice 'n golden. Hoppy but balanced. Sassy bitterness to make it a dangerously drinkable 8%'er!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drank today 3/18. Canned on 3/3. Brother I served with shipped me a 4 pack from NH. First time I’ve got to taste this super high rated beer.\nIt did not disappoint. Color was surprisingly light when poured in the frosted mug (against the can’s instructions). That was the lowest mark I gave the beer (4). It looked like Crap Lite out of the can. As a comparison, I think The Arrogant Bastard is the sexiest pouring beer (......well after Guinness Draught of course).\nSmell I can’t place. Hay field in high summer, next to a citrus farm with pine trees planted? I knew I was about to get punched in the face!\nTaste? Best. Beer. I’ve. Ever. Tasted. Period. So complex. So drinkable. 8% only expressed itself about 2/3 the way through the glass, because my head was swimming.\nFeel. Just the right amount of lacing. Not thin. Not thick. Absolutely baby bear for me.\nOverall. I think I’ve already jumped ahead here. Do what you can to get this. You’ll not be disappointed. I suppose I’ll follow the directions and drink the next one from the can? Maybe? Going to see my Yankee Brotha this fall, so I’ll have to grab a case if I can. This beer is almost enough to make me move to New England.........not!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev one of the best beers ive ever had",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Got that beer from a trade with Beergoot\n\nExceptional beer to say the least. Likewise its little sister Focal Banger, a very refreshing, tasteful, flavorful and awesome all around. \n\n8% that are well hidden, I couldn’t even feel any warmth of alcohol.\n\nNear perfection in a can regarding DIPA. Well done and done well The Alchemist.\n\nCheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;So... the first time I had a chance to try this beer I watched a friend's roommate chug one at about 10aM on a Saturday... and not share any with the group. (douchebag!!) :( Fast forward to 2022 and i've been lucky/ spoiled to taste this a few times now as CO gets a mini distribution a couple times a year. This 4 pack was canned just over a month ago so should still have some nice freshness. \n\nL: Light orange/ gold color, hazy but not murky or cloudy, light, lingering white head with excellent head retention. Nice legs/ lacing on glass. \n\nS: Admittedly i'm a bit plugged up (allergies yay...) but made sure to jot some notes when I was able to smell this beer without any allergies to screw up things: Big nose of citrus, peach, tangerine, a bit of herbal mint, and dank notes. Very citrus forward and the beer really comes alive in the nose. Yes, the can instructions you not to pour in a glass but I just couldn't drink from the can when I wanted to experience the full range of flavors/ hops/ aromas. \n\nT: This is perhaps one of the most flavorful/ wonderful ipa's ive had. It is so balanced it is a bit mind-blowing. The caramel malts, hops/ yeast/ esters/ all come into play and contribute but nothing overpowers. The hops are the front runner and steal the show but the beer is not bitter/ astringent at all. A remarkable brewing feat and makes you want to pour the whole 4 pack in a big glass and chug it! I love the malt sweetness here its a bit like a white birthday cake flavor. then you get a nice range of citrus/ tropical hits like pineapple, mango and tangerine, peach. Then a clean, crip getaway. The beer is lively, bright and very, very balanced. Balanced is right! Did anyone mention this is balanced? \n\nF: light/ medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Not overly slick or thick. Not watery. Clean on the palate and easy to enjoy with food or by itself. \n\nO: ONe for the ages! At nearly 8% abv this one is a dangerous sneaker-upper- make you puke on your shoeser- after 9 of these... This is one that really lives up to the hype. Maybe one of the cleanest and most drinkable ipa's out there. I'll seek this out whenever I hear about it. Usually I think about replacements or similar beers I could buy that would be on par with some east coast hyped up haze bro beers... this one I dont' know that I can do that... Well done Alchemist! Now I can see why the alcoholic roommate chugged this after breakfast!... cant really blame the guy after all.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured last 1/4 into a glass after drinking from can. Great foamy white head and slightly hazy deep gold color. The nose is pineapple juice and thick summer grass in an uncut field. A nice biscuity aroma comes in at the end. The taste is a huge jolt of piney and resinous bitterness that recedes into peach and tangerine sweetness. The finish is dry earthy hay and lavender that lingers for awhile. There is an almost silky feel. This is so very good. That initial taste is memorable. I'm not sure if I like this more than the Pliny's, but this is an outstanding beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s the best. Not your crushable beer, this is one to drink a single can of, or split with a friend and truly savor. A lot of flavor in that can, and as they suggested it does hold the aroma in the can.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One month old. Can to snifter.\n\nLook: Pours an opaque golden brown with a beautifully thick white head. Minimal lacing. Plenty of floaters. \n\nSmell: Hoppy and malty. Grassy, resinous and slightly sweet. Hints of pineapple.\n\nTaste: First sweet, then bitter. Hoppy and malty. Grassy, resinous and herbal. Balanced and complex at the same time. Minimal notes of stone fruits, pineapple and tangerine. \n\nFeel: Crisp and clean, but also full-bodied and aromatic. Very crushable. Perfect carbonation.\n\nOverall: Somewhere between New England IPA, West Coast IPA and Lager, this iconic brew is a textbook example of a perfectly crafted and complex yet highly drinkable beer. Compared to other top rated brews and regarding its legendary reputation, Heady Topper might feel a bit unspectacular at the beginning, but make no mistake: even after almost 20 years this beer tastes as fresh and modern as ever.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The best, ever, period. Thankful for my close proximity to the Vermont border.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Heady Topper during the Bills win over New England. That’s good",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I mean. C'mon.\n\nA DIPA that has the right touch to draw in anti-IPA folks. It has the right amount of spice and sweetness to tamper down the hoppiness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s really hard to rate a beer this iconic - expectations play such a huge role. I was expecting the greatest thing I’ve ever tasted and this definitely wasn’t that. With that said, it’s a very good beer that for me didn’t live up to the hype. \n\nAbsolutely phenomenal nose with huge fresh hop notes, all there to be tasted and mellowing into pineapple and citrus. Finish more bitter than I expected and mouthfeel a little thinner than expected but the hop flavor stays with you. Great to try an icon but overall only a 4.25 for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’ll start off by saying this beer is unlike anything I’ve ever tried. My expectations were so high I thought Michael Jordan was going to jump out of the can when I opened it. It didn’t quite live up to that expectation. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Was it the best Imperial IPA I’ve ever tried. Unfortunately not. The floral note in the taste was phenomenal, but the overall body of the beer didn’t blow me away. Still very glad I got to try this beer because it’s been on my bucket list for a long time.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 2021/11/29, consumed 2021/12/21.\n\nL: Pours slightly hazy and golden (almost orange), medium head, persistent lacing.\n\nS: Varied a bit in the can vs. the glass I eventually poured it into; it seemed more resinous in the can and more floral when I let it open up more. That may be part of it warming up, though.\n\nT: I get mainly citrus notes and sweetness in the front, which gives way to hoppy bitterness that lingers for a while (but not as sticky as Focal Banger). From the can, again, I got more pine/resin notes. Overall a real tour of everything hops can do.\n\nF: A lot of depth to it. At first it seems surprisingly light but there's a lot of body to it as you go. Not as sticky as Focal, to me.\n\nO: I can't bring myself to rate this higher than I would rate Pliny the Elder, and my taste runs more toward Focal Banger than it did the last time I had this, but it remains a great one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The taste was disappointing based on the hype. Hoppiness was very low, bitter is medium. Just average or below overall. I enjoy large numbers of beers, this isn't one of them.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Over hyped IMO.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just a bit of haze infiltrating the amber body along with a medium size white head and good lacing. After inhaling everything hoppy, from citrus to pine and everything in between, there wasn't much room for the malts to make a statement. Thought they might take a step forward in the taste, but nyet, still awash in all the hop pleasures. Bold and bitter right thru to the aftertaste. Full-to-bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that is so welcome after weeks of malty marzens and festbiers. Could easily pass for a DIPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottles and on tap into a 16oz nonic pint glass.\nL: Pours a slightly cloudy caramel amber with a 1.5&quot; off-white rocky head with very good retention. It is well carbonated right to the end of the pint. Some skeletal lacing and banding.\nS: Apricot, peach, light pineapple, pine, raisins, light sweet bread.\nT: Earthy apricot, sweet ripe tangerine, lemon peel, mango, juicy pine and toasted grains. It is fairly bitter with pine resin lingering throughout the finish and is moderately sweet and resinous.\nF: It has a firm, lightly sticky medium-bodied mouthfeel that is smooth with a long finish. It is not jarring with hops yet they are bold and balanced.\nO: I first tried this beer in 2008. A bottle pour produces a bit more foam than does a tap pour. It is an excellent full flavored hop-forward West Coast IPA. It's well balanced hop configuration flavors remind me of the children's breakfast cereal &quot;Fruit Loops&quot;. It is very excellent in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 1/25/21\n\nThis is one of those beers that I had for the first time very early on in my craft journey but never reviewed. From what I remember of my 21st, I had a lot of this and the grapefruit variant, and kinda just stopped going back to them after that. Not for any particular reason, but I started branching out since I had the options. So when I saw this and the grapefruit one lying around recently, I just had to pick them up, even though they were older cans they deserve a proper review\n\nPours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nDespite the age on the can, this is still in your face hoppy and fresh, which is really what drew me to this beer more than anything when I first had it. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy hops, pithy grapefruit, coriander, lemon rind, biscuity malt, and light caramel\n\nAs I said, I recall the aroma being the high point, and the taste lagging a bit behind, but in this case I think it's the age showing a bit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting pine sap, bready malt, white pepper, pithy grapefruit, and peach. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, and toasted grain\n\nA light medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a slick yet firm beer. Finishes off dry and feels much lighter than the 7% it actually is\n\nThis beer is an institution for a reason. An absolute classic which holds up today, but I can only imagine what it was like for people to experience this one in the early days. A treasure of a beer that I think I'll have to come back to more often",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer, is top tier IPA. It is very bitter, but with character and makes this one of a kind. Meant To wow all those who are tired of the same hazies, same ol imperials, whatever. This beer is unique. Look is obviously excellent, bright and opaque. As for feel, well it goes down with ease, with the feel of a superior beer. Carbonation, nuetrality, and taste that's what you need. If warm, it may not feel so great, due to it's strong flavor. \n\nThis beer is worth more than market. It really should be priced a bit more than it's competition, but it's not. So it's a great deal to boot. \n\nNow, the alcohol. This beer hits you. It is totally reliable to make you extra drunk and fast. Be wary and believe me and my fellow Sculpin lovers. This is also added value. Ballast Point will go down in history for this legendary beer. My only complaint may be consistency. It's very strong IPA, so a bit more likely to get an off-batch once in a blue moon",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This used to be an amazing beer, whoever is brewing it now has destroyed it, I would put it it in the ranks of Goose Island IPA, which is an absolute abomination of an IPA. Truly sad, this used to be an iconic beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Finally getting a decent fresh supply of this beer after living without it many years in our area of SC. Foam tried to escape the can upon opening. Poured into an IPA glass.\nAroma of fresh hops; hoppy taste that is slightly bready with a medium bitter finish. Improves as it warms; alcohol is well disguised.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.\n\nBottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°\n\nOverall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly! \n\nL: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom. \n\nS: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall \n\nT:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes. \n\nF: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smooth",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pretty delicious stout, not too much comes close. love the blend of choco and coffee.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Poured from a 12 oz into a glass - Midnight black pour just like a stout. lightly thin/ brown foam risen to the surface. Quickly dissolves over time. A bit of lacing on the sides like some of these bubbles don't want to give up.\nSmell: Getting the heavy notes of sweet bourbon barrels - getting some chocolatey vanilla aromas to it. Not much on the coffee side this pour.\nTaste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!\nFeel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.\nOverall: This bad boy proves to live up to it's standards. Wasn't sure because barrel aged stouts aren't my route but this proved me differently. Will buy again and if you haven't tried it. This is a must try beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip glass. Bottled on 9/9/21.\n\nL---Darkest brown color. Fairly thin light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left ok lacing.  Head doesn't sound like much, but I think it's actually pretty good for the high ABV.\n\nS---Strong chocolate, lighter vanilla and bourbon barrel. Not as much coffee as I was expecting.\n\nT---Wow, very flavorful and nuanced. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla are all distinct. ABV is well hidden behind sweetness. \n\nF---Medium/full bodied with minimal carbonation. Almost a creamy texture with no alcohol burn.\n\nO---I have been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. The best offering from an excellent brewery.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nL - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.\n\nS - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.\n\nT - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.\n\nF - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink. \n\nO - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.\n\nAgain, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very strong coffee and bourbon flavors. The coffee flavor seemed a little odd to me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful color and head. Notes of chocolate. Slight coffee flavor while sipping. Very slight bourbon taste, which is fine. Very delicious, but not as rich as I was hoping or expecting.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 1/5/22 Bottled 10/14/21. Chocolate predominates aroma &amp; taste then coffee. Full bodied, smooth &amp; sweet. Beautiful creamy head. Excellent but prefer slightly less alcohol.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very similar to CBS and also just as good. I lack the finer filters to define taste as well as most other reviews can, but I do enjoy the taste of this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased as a single bottle from Ingles for $1.50. Poured into a whiskey snifter.\n\nL - A viscous motor oil black with a one-finger coffee-colored head. Excellent lacing.\nS - Deep dark chocolate with a bourbon base. Freshly-roasted espresso beans. It smells like it's going to be very rich...\nT - That was intense. Dark chocolate punches you, then kisses you with a nice roasted coffee with chicory, then kicks you in the balls with the bourbon. The ABV isn't noticeable until the end of the glass, but by time that happens you feel insanely warm already. Well-balanced all around, and each note is plain and simple - no deciphering here!\nF - Silky. Thick. Full-bodied, with little - if any - carbonation.\nO - An incredible brew that delivers on what it set out to be. I would highly recommend having this beer at least once before you die. Although with that 12% ABV, I probably wouldn't have it for breakfast...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fresh on tap KBS is excellent—the coffee and chocolate really comes through. In my opinion the oak barrel is overwhelming and adds a disgusting nuance to an otherwise world class beer. In a bottle the coffee and chocolate are barely detectable and the oak bourbon becomes rancid. The body is too watery for the sticky-sweet taste. I’d say it is about on par with the regular breakfast stout, but much worse than CBS and the maple Mackinac fudge variant.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Pitch black pour with a thick tan head and sticky foam lace that lasts forever.\nSmell and Taste: Coffee, chocolate and bourbon.\nFeel: Smooth as silk.\nOverall: Never had a desire for a stout for breakfast . . . until now.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I have tried some overly boozy beers before, and this isn't it. Coffee is the most prominent note. A fairly thick, sweet but finely balanced and surprisingly drinkable stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I know I'm in the minority when I say I'm not head over heels for this beer. I find that it seems a little too &quot;flavored&quot; to be in the world-class category that most people put it in. I can definitely see why many would like this beer a lot. It is very flavorful and has a smooth character, although the after taste can be a little bitter. The pour is extremely dark and inviting. Personally though, I feel Founders Backwoods Bastard is the better brew that they offer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Big fan of KBS especially now it's available year round and at a good price point (in my area at least). I generally trust founders to produce quality big beer and this is no outlier there. Character is robust and full, lovely bitter notes and the adjuncts accent rather than interfere so there's a nice marriage overall. So yeah, if you enjoy the bitter robust notes from barrel character to roast malt this is a lovely option.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev You don't have to be a Stout Connosseur to LOVE this one. I'm surprised (Frankly) that it is rated #12. This beauty is a consistent HIT whenever and wherever. Taste is heavenly rapture with a slowly retreating follow-through. Makes you want another right away!\n\nYou can relish in the bourbon tones right after you swallow. Chocolate is in there, too. Coffee is divine.\n\nFeel is perfect. No unusual ticks to be found. Serve at proper temperature.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Founders KBS is a flavored stout that is barrel aged. It pours a dark brown with a brown head and a boozy nose reminiscent of bourbon. The chocolate is clear up front and slowly turns more bitter and almost barrel wood flavor. It eventually fades out, leaving room for the next sip. It's definitely a high octane beer at 12%, and I'm glad I tried it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks rich and dark. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste thick and malty. For a stout, id say its pretty tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Tried this first at about 45°F and then let warm to about 55°F.\n\nAt 45°F\nL Deepest chocolate, decent dark brown head but dissipates quickly, no lacing.\nS Alcohol first, actual malt structure is lost beneath adjuncts and barrel aromas. Coffee note seems stale.\nT Taste follows smell, except surprisingly and unpleasantly bitter. Very little evidence of malt or hops.\nF Very little creaminess, thin and effervescent.\nO The high sticker price must cover all of those additional ingredients and aging in barrels because the malt and hops don't seem to be substantial enough or high enough quality to justify it.\n\nTried this again at 55°F, since some beers sweeten up and seem to lose bitterness slightly warmer. This one did not.\n\nThe high average rating must be owing to people mistaking heavily flavored beer for good quality beer. Definitely less than the sum of its parts and I can't get past the sickly bitter note that persists from first sip and lingers as an aftertaste. It also gives me to speculate that the brewer does not have an acute sense of bitterness -- some people simply do not. Unfortunately for those of us that do, it is undrinkable. Did not finish 12oz and do not recommend it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look is very dark. The head is a very unique dark brown color with a hint of grey. The smell has coco and bourbon. The taste is actually really bright with a crisp finish which leaves a lot of aroma behind. The feel is medium thick. Overall this is a great beer and fairly easy to find.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Thick, malty sweet with a long finish. The one I go to when I have a little time to swirl the snifter. Pours thick. Smells like your favorite whiskey bar. Bourbon notes perfume the entire sip. The viscosity is like real Vermont maple syrup. Start your beer session with this one, then move on to Dragon’s Milk or Backward Bastard for your second or third if you are still standing."

For me to spend $20 on a sixer, it has to be outstanding. Real bitterness. 4.25\n\nOriginal 1/31/2020 Easily the most overrated beer on earth. And, yes, I still get one (some years even 2, a long time ago an actual sixer) every year thinking I will change my opinion. That's stupid, because I never do. Very mediocre and actually boring, even smelled a little bit like poop poured into my mason jar. Thank goodness, the aroma quickly cleared. Pretty golden color I guess. Smells decently of malt and hops, I don't detect the honey at all. Taste follows, fresh but way too mild. Overall boring as hell.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!\n\nPouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.\n\nThe first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else. \n\nThis is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me. \n\nStill, very good.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The original and I’ve reviewed a few variants over the years but not this one amazingly. It pours a dark brownish black with a decent tan head for a big stout. It smells of whiskey, and bourbon, barrel, wood, vanilla, anise. Tastes the same; barrel, bourbon, vanilla, anise, some hops that round out a panoply of flavors. It’s the original, huge, badass stout and still one of the best. I’ve enjoyed catching up with this every Black Friday for several years and it never disappoints.

And this beer isn't &quot;wrong,&quot; it's just basic and underwhelming. In short, it takes like a Sam Adams with a touch of dark.\n\nL: Very dark. Opaque black. It's a good start to a stout in that sense, but the pour looked thin to me. Not something I'm used to when serving an imperial stout. The head was a couple inches in height that took 5 minutes to start dissipating, and I can hear it fizzing out with a film of bubbles lining the glass where it once stood. \n\nS: &quot;Generic beer&quot;. I was hoping for a malty, smoky smell to align with the flavor profiles others described. I held out hope that the taste would contradict my initial experience, but...\n\nT&amp;F: I did a doubletake on the bottle to confirm that I had bought a stout. At this point, I was sure I must've misread the bottle when I purchased it or grabbed the wrong case off of the shelf. It's thin and lacks any unique flavor. It tastes like a dark beer. No &quot;smoke&quot; as others describe and no malty thickness I've grown accustomed to in a good, imperial stout. As previously stated, it tastes like any Sam Adams that you could grab.\n\nO: Basic. Unremarkable. Ordinary. Not offensive, but certainly not worth seeking out or even purchasing again. And judging it as a stout, it fails in many of the characteristics you'd expect.",

The citrusy character of Dogfish Head’s 60 Minute IPA leaves my tastebuds wanting more compared to the more malty character of Lagunitas IPA. \n\nThis is a fairly nicely balanced session IPA that leans a tiny bit more on the hop forward/herbal side of the house, but not nearly even close to something like Stone IPA’s level of super strong somewhat unbalanced hop character. This is more comparable to Lagunitas IPA balance wise, but I still prefer Lagunitas IPA over this. Not a bad IPA.",

A half inch of frothy foam sits on top that dissipates to a thin layer over time. Lots of lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Smells chewy. Candied malts with a soapy, evergreen pine and citrus hoppiness. Taste is similar to the aroma. Lots of piney hops, a little bit of lemon/citrus and a lovely, sweet, bready maltiness in the background. Finishes bitter and a tad dry with lingering lemon and citrus rind on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of creaminess and a touch of chewiness.\n\nThis is a superbly crafted brew, at one time probably one of the best IPAs in the U.S. It remains a very solid offering with a great amount of flavor and complexity, if a bit &quot;old school&quot; tasting. A great example of a hop-forward beer that isn't overly hopped. It is balanced quite nicely with a low-key malt profile that adds ample body and just enough counteraction to the bitterness. I'm surprised I never reviewed this, as I had originally tried this well over a decade ago. It's interesting to revisit it after all this time. Cheers!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16oz pint on tap at Sickie's Garage Sioux Falls, SD\nL: Clear med-dark caramel gold color with med-low carbonation. A thin off-white head with spotty lacing.\nS: Pine resin, sweet hops. Quite simple.\nT: It's taste is stern with crisp pine, light citrus, sweet earthy grass, grains and pine lingers. There is light caramelized biscuit malt and the earthy hops are a bit spicy. It is hop forward.\nF: Brisk, semi-juicy med-bodied mouthfeel that is relatively smooth drinking and has a med-long finish.\nO: 60 minute IPA has low bitterness for the most part yet has a complexity of hops and is slightly dank. It is excellent in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This isn't terrible but it's definitely fucking bore snore to me trying it for the first time now. Can dates in January of 2022 so perhaps I could have it a smidge fresher but idk. I liked Hazy-O better. This is just milktoast.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle. Clear, pale amber colour with a rapidly collapsing, off-white head. Caramelised orange aroma. Clean, not heavy, flavours of marmalade and resin. Medium body with a full mouth coating and a bitter finish. Classic AIPA. A stack load of hops nicely balanced by a solid malt base. A 20yo classic.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s an IPA. Slight haze descent head and nice small bubbles. More crisp than malty. Flavor of the hops add pine notes and a grapefruit citrus. Easy drinking and down the middle for the type.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev satisfactory but ultimately forgettable",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Needed a crisp, lighter break from my usual NE Impetial IPAs. \nThis is always a smooth, crisp, hoppy choice.\nAlso better chilled than the 90-minute, which is my sipping dessert choice."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A perfect every day beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep-ish golden-orange, with a nice finger and a half, foamy white head. The head has lasting impact in my glass, lasting the entirety of the drink, well over 15 minutes. Long lines of bubbles run up the glass. Looks amazing. Thick generous lacing lines the entirety of the glass as it empties. \n\nSmells of wheat, bread, floral hops with a touch of bitterness. It’s clean and fresh smelling. Some piney notes, notes of grassy straw. General zesty citrus in the background. It’s as clean and classic as you can get.\n\nSome have described SNPA as a mix between an APA and an IPA, but this is just straight up APA for me with mild balancing bitterness. Gentle floral hop, grassy flavours wash over the tongue before revealing straight up sweet caramel malt, some tasty bready wheat notes, and the citrus I notice here, mostly grapefruit. Gentle but tasty. It’s so straight up clean that it almost feels more complex than it is. SNPA has never been described as the absolute boldest, biggest smash your face flavour beer, but it isn’t any worse for it. When you want that clean, crisp, yet flavourful and subtle APA, this is the taste you think of in your mind. It is your classic example personified in an actual beer. \n\nIt’s well carbonated but not super strong; resulting in a nicely smooth, mildly creamy sip. Subtle medium long finish, that leaves just a hint of bitterness and lightly roasted grains on your tongue. Finishes clean and semi-dry. It’s so easy drinking and clean I’d consider this light bodied myself.\n\nWhen thinking and comparing this beer to others, I want to give it a higher ranking than I ultimately put here. There is more aspects to some beers than just the categories here. SNPA is a work-horse, a beer that can be easily drank all night, be enjoyed by quite literally every single beer drinker no matter what style preference you have, and is a super clean straight up benchmark of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had it on cask at Brick Store, Decatur, Georgia, March 2022. I've never been an IPA or even a pale ale guy. The mouthfeel from the hops just doesn't do it for me. Having it on cask is an entirely different story. Some (not all) previous cask tries on my part conveyed a beer devoid of all carbonation, mouthfeel and coldness all in the name of purity. Now comes Sierra Pale on cask and the difference could not be more distinct. Maybe the best mouthfeel ever and then you get all of the taste profile and aroma that you would want, plus just about the perfect level of carbonation, and there you have it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle dated 9-28-2021\nAppearance: Cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. A nice-looking beer.\n\nSmell: Mild piney aromas and mild bready notes. The nose is fairly mild, but the beer was bottled over 4 months ago.\n\nTaste: Some mildly sweet fruit notes and some faint pine notes present in the flavor profile. The beer has a mildly sweet initial taste which dies off somewhat with some lingering bitter hop notes.\n\nMouth-feel: Fairly light-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.\n\nOverall: A good beer that I've had before but never reviewed. I suspect the beer being over 5 months ago may have impacted it's impression so I may seek out a fresh example and review it again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Pours a translucent, bright orange with a two finger head of soapy, off-white foam. Laces the glass pretty well.\n\nAroma: Caramel malt and strong pine resin. Very bitter on the nose. Slightly tropical with mild hints of orange zest. Fairly straightforward.\n\nTaste: Pleasantly bitter upfront with a warm, dry resinous pine sap note. Goes tropical midpalate with bitter-sweet flavors of orange zest and peppery grapefruit rind. Fades out into savory flavors of brown sugar and toffee.\n\nFeel: Thirst quenching. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated.\n\nOverall: I'm very surprised it took me so long to get around to reviewing this one since I drink it all the time. Sierra Nevada pale ale is one of my all time favorite beers. You honestly can't go wrong with this - an absolute classic American pale ale.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 1/12/22 Clean, crisp, low alcohol. Perfect for it’s style. Nice summer beer but prefer something bolder (ie Torpedo). A solid offering.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Too bitter for me. I remember liking this when I was younger, last Sierra I had was 18 years ago. I do like how crisp and refreshing it is. Glad I bought it though, as I continue my search for the best beer for me I can buy on regular basis. Sam Adams is next, then anchor steam. Gonna keep trying and digging the journey. \n\nLighter than an IPA which is nice, as IPAs I am not a fan. But 805 tastes better than Sierra. I don’t understand why this is rated as Outstanding. I don’t have to however. Again, I am a Lager guy.\n\nSo I am on the 3rd Sierra, and this beer is getting better. It’s quite a satisfying buzz too. Think I need to look for stronger beers. \n\nOk on my 5th Sierra. Gonna drink the whole 6. It gets better. Past the 3rd. Still, my too bitter comment is honest. Probably why I prefer lagers and stouts. But I get it. Sierra is a great beer buzz.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark amber with white head. Light citrus and pine smell and taste. Hops not over powering. Easy drinking.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours semi-clear amber color with a two finger foamy head with nice lacing. Smell of yeast, light hops, honey. Flavor notes of biscuit, berry with a light hop bitterness on the finish. Above average mouth feel with nice carbonation and dry finish. You can't go wrong with this Sierra Nevada work horse! This Pale Ale is a tried and true offering that delivers every time!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Folks, simply put, if you are a hophead, this is what you want. It may not be the cool new and exciting thing on the block, but it is a classic for a reason - the Led Zeppelin IV of IPA’s. I’m a little tired of all these 16 ounce 4 packs of hipster IPA’s with their arty packaging that are usually pretty meh. All sizzle with little steak. I am also way tired of hazy IPA’s. I am West Coast all the way, and this one right here is just perfect: lemony, bitter, clean, refreshing, chewy, and all the hops you could ever want - hops that stay with you for awhile after each sip. It’s not expensive, it’s easy to find, and it is the prototype of what a WC IPA should be. Those young bucks with their 4 packs need to recognize. This is the real deal Holyfield.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It gets better the more I drink, and isn’t that the sign of a great beer? It’s very hoppy. Hoppy. Hoppy is a weird weird. Say it like 50 times in a row and you will start to question whether or not it is even a real word. Hoppy. The only reason I know it’s still a weird is Siri says it’s a word. I never met my grandfather. No, the other one. Pairs well with broken dreams and the frustration that comes with realizing that the perception of any progress is quickly dissolved into the endless sea of society and reality and life. A beer review is not the correct place for a cry for help, they said.",

Pine and fir flex some once the citrus subsides and closes with citrus rejoining the coniferous notes along with a big hop bite in tow\nMouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, and moderate dryness on the finish\nOverall: I dig it. A classic and delicious WCIPA that drinks like its name as an ‘Extra IPA’ – bigger than an IPA but not quite in full-blown DIPA territory.

I found it in a 12 oz can 6 pack but I poured it into a glass. I would rate this as a solid 'can-go-back-to' beer. Can ABV says 6.5% by volume, and it certainly feels that way. Really solid crispiness and hop forward as one would expect. I'd recommend it to my friends, so I'd recommend it to you guys. First time having anything from 3 Floyds (I think).

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This serving was drawn from a tap and poured into a clear pint glass. It is one magnificent looking beer. Its color is light copper-amber with a bright display aspect. The modest head is just off-white, tight and enduring. The smell just about lives up to its looks. There's plenty mild sweetness provided by the malt. Then, there's a hoppiness that seems to be in perfect balance. Traces of yeast and alcohol complete the treat. The nose didn't mislead on this one. This is first noticed to be a wonderfully smooth brew. No doubt credit goes to the malting, which provides a great body without the expense of being too sweet. Now, it can be noticed how beautiful this laces the inside of the glass as it recedes. There's distinct demarcation for each time the glass was raised and consumed from. Neither West Coast-like, with their sharply often piney bite, nor New England-like, with their softened hopping, this is just a really good blend of hops to contrast the malt and confirm to the drinker that this is a full flavored APA. An exceptional taste within an exceptional medium, this is worthy of all the praise.",

Has great hoppy and citrusy notes, even backed by an almost cheesiness, but somehow it still manages to stay smooth going down. I just don't know how they managed to make it go down so smooth.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Enjoying 1/1/21 version on 2/3/21. Unfiltered, but I would not have known except it was labeled as such. Smell is of orange, mango and banana bread. Taste and mouthfeel: Follows smell, citrus up front, creamy in the middle, with strong bitterness at end. But this is Stone. I've had better Enjoy Bys but the state of my tongue is always changing. Maybe I've had more good DIPAs since the first sampling of this beer.\n\nAnother DIPA (looking at you Hopslam) which appear regularly, but like an aging actor who has not realized younger and more sought-after options are grabbing the prime spots, refuses to lower prices. More people are passing. I saved $7 on this sixer by waiting two weeks after the Enjoy By date before picking it up. It was no worse, but not any better, either. And I doubt it was because I purchased it after 1/1/21.",

Tastes of malt and hops in good balance. As the glass warms light citrus and floral tastes come out. Finish is slightly bitter with some alcohol warmth.\n\nMedium body with light carbonation. \n\nI have had several earlier editions of this series and my recollections are they all were more adventuresome and unique than this one. It's not bad at all. It's a well made straight forward mild mannered strong IPA.",

Complex! Tropical, Dry with good balance, Hoppy with good balance, Alcohol is so well hidden at 9.4%!!!\n*Finish: decent crisp, hoppy bite but not overwhelming. The finish keeps you wanting more! \n**Final Verdict**: \nThis in my view is THE BEST DOUBLE IPA ON THIS PLANET and Stone’s Best Creation. Best smelling IPA.

Not a whole lot to say here other than that it looks attractive and refreshing.\n\nThe aroma on this was predictably hop-forward, presenting a nice balance between aromas of tropical fruits and citrus. In the front-end I got notes of grapefruit and oranges which then subsided a bit towards the middle and end to showcase notes of mangoes and pineapples.\n\nTo be honest, the taste on this was pretty boring. I really only found notes of bitter grapefruit throughout the entirety of the beer. This tasted pretty decent, but I wished that the taste would have followed the hoppiness that I got from the nose. Instead, I got a one-note grapefruit tasting IPA which made this beer pretty average for me.\n\nLike other IPAs I found this to be pretty quaff-able, especially for the 9.4% ABV. Some people might be turned off by the lingering bitterness of this, but I didn't mind it. With this being medium-bodied and with high carbonation, this beer presented a nice refreshing, crisp, and grapefruit-y experience.\n\nOverall, the aroma on this was spectacular, but the taste on this was pretty one note and boring. I wished there was more complexity to this on the taste, but all I got was citrus-y bitter grapefruit. I probably won't buy this again, but it wasn't bad, just average tasting for me.",

Very floral and bitter yet smooth. Alcohol is VERY well-hidden. \n\nM: Medium bodied. Good amount of carb bite. Finishes with grapefruit/hop bitterness. \n\nO: This has never disappointed me year by year -- it's just expertly made. It drinks like a 7-7.5% abv IPA.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Dark bronze/sapphire body with a head that reminds me of a latte. Lacing throughout. \n\nSmell: Raisin bread. slight candied orange notes. Slight grapefruit. Citrus and baking spice if I had to sum it up. Complex indeed.\n\nTaste: Orange zest, intense pine. Some fresh dark bread notes. Slight raisin, slightest black pepper alcohol burn on the finish.\n\nFeel: Creamy body. Quite drinkable for a +7 % ABV. I can't imagine trying this beer on Nitro, I think it'd take it to the next level.\n\nOverall: This is one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer. Distinctly remember it being the early 2010's and becoming burned out on the typical West Coast IPA (ironic because it's come full circle and that's my favorite style yet again) and wanting to try something different. Then and now Bastard has been a refreshing look on a style I'd otherwise not consider. Just a really well-made beer. Probably not your every day brew, but this was a great &quot;random&quot; beer to have today.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a clear ruby color with a nice cap of light khaki colored foam.\n\nSmell: Sweet, toasty, floral and slightly medicinal. Islay Scotch barrel aged Robitussin with a massive dose of hops.\n\nTaste: Sharp and bitter hops up front. Malt contributes a bit of sweetness at the get-go but quickly shifts to a drier and heavily toasted taste. It's difficult for me to pick out any one flavor in particular. It's a complex beer but it's also a barrage on the senses. Rye comes to mind as does charred toast, peat, bitter tylenol-like hops and some oak. Heavily bitter all the way through.\n\nFeel: Medium bodied, sharp carbonation, dry.\n\nOverall: Not an easy drinking beer, but I didn't expect it to be anyway. I can totally understand how some people might not like it, but I've been a fan for close to 10 years now. When I want something to light up my palate I go for one of these. Well worth the money.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I found this in the fridge and couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed it. It pours a dark brownish ruby color with an off-white head. The nose is primarily malt with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is almost identical, with the heavy grain flavor up front and ending with the hoppy bitterness. It must be my bottle, but it feels like the back end of the flavor is missing from what I remember.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark reddish copper, clear, off-white head. Smells like toasted raisin bread, on the subtle side. Theres some light citrus notes as well. There’s an initial taste of caramel malts and biscuit immediately followed by a freight train of intense hop bitterness. You can vaguely taste some slight pine/citrus/spice from the hops but it’s mostly just early addition bittering hops that almost make it seem “hot”. No doubt about it, the labels right, if you’re a casual beer drinker or someone who is not very schooled in beer styles you will definitely not like this. It should be appreciated for how being a well made ale.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Honestly, they were partially right with that label description. I hated it. Not because my palate isn’t refined enough, but because honestly this just wasn’t good. Definitely arrogant. Really bitter, but the bitterness isn’t leading you to anything, it’s just there. It’s very piney in my opinion and if the bitterness leads you anywhere, thats it. Pine cones and juniper bushes. Honestly just kind of nasty. I won’t be getting it again, and I’m surprised at how many people actually like this. I don’t really waste beer ever, if I open it I drink it all and give it a fair shot, but this one went down the sink about half way through.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Decent but not extraordinary.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I poured an Imperial pint can into a standard shaker pint glass. It was one of those beers arrayed in the singles at my local liquor store annex to the large grocery chain. The beer has plenty of malt taste (that abv is a good hint) without much sweetness -- and just enough hop bitterness for my tastes. I found it to be kind of like a balanced IPA. I'm not sure why I didn't have this until this year (in February), but I'll be having more in the future!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep reddish-brown with a very rich light brown head. For the aroma, I immediately observe toasty caramel malts. On the fruity end there is pineapple. I taste a highly bitter beer that conceals the malt flavors. The finish is highly bitter and their is some alcohol warmth. Just not a lot of flavor in this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cannot believe not reviewed before - from first time I had in 1990s as gift from my father-in-law (I hated it) to today, it is the classic hop journey.\nClear deep reddish mahogany pour with two fingers of creamy/frothy tawny coloured head.\nMalty nose - caramel , toffee, notes of citrus hop, piney; slightly floral.\nYeah - that's the stuff - sweet caramel, toffee malt that is obliterated by sticky resinous hop bitters - grapefruit peel, pine, orange rind; earthy.\nMedium mouthfeel with decent but not overbearing carbonation - lingering and building bitterness washes over the palate.\nThis remains a trailblazing beer that may not be for every day consumption, but every time I come back to it I love it and love how at first I did not.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Im sure when this came out it was edgy and cool but the soliloquy on the bottle is nauseating in the modern day. Anyways, I get a lit malt, aggressively bitter hops as advertised, also idk how 7.2 makes this a strong anything but that's besides the point. Bottom line for me is this just doesn't taste very good at all. I feel like its one of those beers people drink to get faded and not cuz it tastes good, it is getting a little easier to drink as i get through it, maybe it'll grow on me.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good look and medium/heavy feel. I was hoping the taste would be 50/50 hop malt but definitely hop forward probably 75/25 hop to malt.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not much to add that hasn't already been said. If you're looking for a true celebration of hops, this is the one to search for. Just enough bite from the hops, just enough grain to smooth, and just enough sweetness to complete the package. As close as an American IPA comes, to excellence in balance. As far as I'm concerned, this drink sets the bar to judge other IPAs.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great looking brew on the pour -- red hue and a big pillowy head and thick rings of lace. Aroma is very hoppy and slightly dank. Taste is complex -- bitter, hoppy resin start with malty middle with some citrus sweet mixed in. This is a really nice holiday brew that most hop heads and IPA lovers will like. ABV is what you would expect, but it isn't boozy. A well-crafted American IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz can\nOn the pour the color is dark for an IPA, almost red, but still in the amber range decent head looks frothy with some bigger bubbles, fair retention. Very light lacing that doesnt love to stick around.\n\nThe smell hits as soon as you start pouring. Strong piny hops are strong in this one, definitely a wesr coast/traditional american feel on the nose. Malt is largely overshadowed in the smell, but on the back there is a hint of resinous citrus.\n\nTaste is very strong and a classic bitter american IPA but the hop nuance still shines through beyond the bitter. The malt is much more present in flavor and imparts an amber malty sweetness carrying it along nicely. As a malt head myself I appreciate that. The alcohol is detectable bit not in a boozy way per se, more in addition to the hoppy bitterness. The bitterness does tend to stick around for a bit after a sip.\n\nThe feel is quite heavy I must say but it certainly warms you up as it should, as a winter seasonal. I can see this being a favorite for the ipa crowd for sure.\n\nOverall a bit hoopy for my taste but I could see that coming, however the hop flavors are of very high quality and the piny hops are a nice touch for an interesting take on seasonal holiday beers.",

Bitter orange lingers well after the swallow. \n\nF: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky followed by bitter hop. It calls for a second sip.\n\nO: Old school IPA. Great citrus-forward hop profile with a solid malt body. The prickly, lively carbonation dances on your tongue and helps dry out the heavy malt. The alcohol heat is just right and seems to kick in right at the end of the beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cloudy copper amber color with a finger of white head. The nose is sticky pine sap, orange peel, with caramel ever present in the background. The first taste is pithy grapefruit, followed by a shot of resinous bitter. There is also a sweetness almost like the corn sweetness in bourbon. The finish is apple pie spice and a lingering bitter that hangs around awhile. The finish is good and dry and a bit creamy. Everything here plays so well together...no rough edges, nothing overpowers, just smooth transitions. Ahhhh...",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy tan color with a dirty beige head which lingers. The color is almost like a hazy dark brown ale. Nose and taste are hoppy with plenty of bitter resinous notes. There’s a mild caramel like sweetness in the taste. Very solid American style ipa."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best before 5/28/2024 - consumed on 3/27/2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Unibroue tulip. \n\nLightly cloudy sunglow body supports a lasting finger of baby powder crema. Fine, dense lacing; no legs; superior retention. \n\nSweet gentle aromatics suggest honey, ripe pear, and hints of spice (cinnamon/coriander/clove/white pepper?). A touch of banana as well. \n\nPalate entry follows the nose, but is followed by a hefty malt note, more phenols/spice, and a low but lingering bitterness. Earthy/grassy/not-quite-floral hop flavors emerge once in a while. House yeast character is present, but by no means dominant. Medium finish with a hint of curaçao (orange), overripe banana, and alcohol.\n\nMedium-bodied, well carbonated, and fairly warming.\n\nWhile lacking the complexity of the better Belgian examples, this remains one of the best domestic/North American renditions available.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hits all the marks for a tripel. Flavor profile seems a touch on the bold side, perhaps to suit the North American palate.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle that I picked up at the store 2 weeks ago. Date stamp of best before 04-19-2024 on this corked and caged bottle.\nPouring into my snifter, the beer is a bright gold color, almost champagne like out of the glass. A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass.\nThe aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway.\nFirst sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation.\nFlavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related. Finish is very dry and encourages me to take another sip.\nthe flavors on this beer are bolder than some other recent tripels and I enjoy the combination of tastes. Quite a solid beer that will sneak up on you with well hidden booze.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 12oz bottle\n\nThe look is highly carbonated with a dark golden lightly hazy body. 2 finger head on the pour larger bubbles, shrinks down to a one finger head of fine bubbles. After sitting for a bit carbonation is still quite lively. Some lacing.\n\nThe aroma iels essentially all belgian yeast with a light crackery malt on the back end. Slight funk sort of makes me think of an older bottle of an AAL, the funk however fits this style much better than a lager, but still throwing me off a little bit. Some fruity esters also detectable.\n\nThe flavor is quite similar to the smell, some light citrus notes followed by banana esters and some hints of clove. Perhaps some of what I'm picking up is the spice it was brewed with as the bottle says. I'm not sure what the spice is. After the ferment character once again some crackery malt shines through. The malt is also sweet and present on the first sip before being overwhelmed by yeast character.\n\nFeel is dominated by the big carbonation. The head doesn't make this one creamy so much as carbonation bite dominates. Despite that the beer is not at all watery and sticks around on the palate for a while.\n\nOverall a good belgian style trippel. I wasn't actually aware it was Canadian however until looking on BA here which docks the score a bit, but the beer itself is a good take on a trippel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A lively carbonated, highly quaffable trippel. This is one I always revisit over the years. Less sweet than most, but still full of those fruity esters, a beautiful floral bouquet awash with lingering spices. Tons of rich flavors are enlivened by the effervescence, more of a gulper than a smooth sipper. I could drink more of these in one sitting than I should",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow with a nice thick two inch head, that slowly recedes into one inch of a thick bubbly ring. Lighter than I expected — or maybe the Belgian Tripels I’ve had so far are just darker than usual.\n\nSpices, cloves, and stone fruit. The aroma is more spice and fruit forward than malty or yeasty, so if that’s your thing for Tripels, you are going to love this. Oh, definite coriander on the nose as well.\n\nThe flavours are somewhat mild for the style but pretty complex. It follows the aromas pretty tightly, but I get a little more malt and wheaty bread like notes here, to be expected. Nothing like Rochefurt Tripel or some other Tripels, but still a pleasant malt backbone. Which makes it finish relatively sweet, but more peppery than you might expect. Some nutmeg and caramel here as well. As always for this style, recommended to not serve ice cold, or to sip slowly and let it warm up and enjoy the evolution of flavours. The finish noticeably lengthens as it warms, and the malty notes in the back are strengthened as it decants. Some candied pear flavours come out here as well that I didn’t notice when it was cold! \n\nSurprisingly light bodied, there is strong carbonation that foams with each sip, which brings out that peppery feel for sure. You will not taste the alcohol whatsoever. Finishes dry and sweet, and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not notice much acidity or bitterness whatsoever.\n\nDue to the lack of ability to import, and LCBO restrictions, Ontario is not the best for international beers. But the one best thing about living here is access to Unibroue. All their beers are great and you can always get them fresh. My bottle was only a few weeks old.\n\nOverall, compared to some of the Belgian Tripels, you might notice it’s a bit less sweet and more balanced in flavours. The malt and yeasty notes are there, but fairly mild. The fruity esters and spicy notes are more of a feature here. If this is your style for Tripels, I can see why this is ranked at the top. If you like serious malt, yeast, sweetness, some of the Trappist beers from Belgium dial it up more. This is still an absolute top tier offering and an absolute must-try for anyone who likes Belgian beers or tripels no matter how you prefer the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep orangish-yellow, white head, decent retention and lace\nPear eau de vie, pepper, cloves, green banana, green peach, vanilla aromas\nPretty much tastes like it smells, minus the vanilla, peppery finish\nLight bodied with appropriate carbonation\nForgot how good this is",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a tulip glass.\n\nL - Pours a dark &amp; hazy goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head. Lacing is excellent; great legs.\nS - Coriander, stone fruit, yeasty breads. Lemongrass, and nutmeg. A bit of white grape, as well.\nT - Taste follows nose. Also getting a bit of raw sugarcane, clove, and citron. Finish is surprisingly dry, and peppery. Fairly sweet until the finish, but well-balanced flavor-wise.\nF - Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and scarily easy-to-drink - I didn't even realize it was 9% ABV until halfway through the glass and I looked closer at the bottle!\nO - Easily one of the best beers I've had; a must-try for everyone. From the color to the flavor, this brew sets the bar for non-Trappist tripels. Spicy, complex, and extremely satisfying. A bit on the sweet side, but the flavor complexity makes up for it. I do intend to purchase this one again, and would highly encourage one to buy it if they see it - even if the price seems a little high for a 12oz bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nose: citrus fruits, apricots, mild grape, minor malt and alcohol smell. Easily one of the most appetizing beers I have experienced. \n\nIn the Glass: Beautiful medium/ dark amber. Pour with a good head as a Tripel should be enjoyed. \n\nPalate: beautiful rich aromas become sweet and complex, FULL bodied, for a 9% alcohol Tripel there is no bite or harshness to La Fin Du Monde. I cannot stress the how full of citrus and sweet fruit this beer is, it is unbelievable that a beer could be this complex. Sweetness mixes well with the malt body. What a great experience\n\nFinish: In the throat the sweetness leaves and moves into a smooth and somewhat more sharp finish. Once again I would never have guessed this is a 9% abv ale. \n\nWhile this Tripel is extremely pricy in Ontario Canada, I urge all those who are into beers whether it be Belgian ales, wheat beers or IPAs, this is truly a great experience.\nThis is the only beer or beverage (I review a lot of single malt scotch whiskies) I would give a perfect rating.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A great Tripel beer similar to Chimay’s Cinq Tripel. It is full of flavor with hints of coffee, chocolate, and clove. Would be considered one of the best Tripel’s the world has to offer, much less Belgium.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the bottle, it pours a clear light yellow-golden color with a nice white head that eventually diminishes to a nice ring. Scent is funky, with alcohol and dark fruits coming through. Taste is initially sweet, followed by a dark fruit enhanced lightly bitter malt.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single, don't remember the price. &quot;BB 02-22-24&quot; and there is some kind of a date code B22211845QFL. Whatever.\n\nLook: This is a bit darker than I expected. It is a pale amber color and has a subtle haze. There is a half pinky finger of frothy khaki-colored head. After pouring the yeast, the head became much bigger and frothier and the beer became hazier and a touch darker in color. Nice lacing. Beautiful appearance.\n\nSmell: The nose is not so bold. Strong aromas of clove, some banana, and alcohol-soaked raisins. Some other spices like cinnamon, pepper, coriander, and ginger also. There is definitely a yeasty/doughy component.\n\nTaste: Up front, it's very sweet but that doesn't last long. The mid palate is malt-forward with banana and notes of fruit compote, and then the spices and dryness take over on the finish. It's interesting. It's also hard for me to describe because I need to reacclimate myself with the style. The finish is super dry and spicy with tons of clove, some nutmeg, ginger, coriander, and pepper.\n\nFeel: Appropriately carbonated. The bottle conditioning gives this a soft, smooth mouthfeel.\n\nOverall: It's been years since I have had this beer. I'm not sure how much I like this; it's a style that is a bit foreign to me because it has been so long. The spices are just so strong. Somehow, it works in this beer but it still tastes a bit &quot;hot&quot; to me not so much in alcohol but in spice on the finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I like everything about this beer so I'm giving it a straight 5 across the board. It's delicious and although I think gluten-free is better for a body, flavor-wise and for the kick of 9% alcohol, this beer is hands down the best.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Maybe Idk what a triple should taste like, I don't believe its world class .. Its good but not a legit Belgian beer. IMO",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells fruity and funky. I can also smell a small amount of beery malts but it smells more like wine than beer.\n\nSweetness is quickly followed by bitterness. Dark fruits like dates and raisins show up.\n\nThe actual liquid is thin but it fills your mouth with bubbly, foamy carbonation. The finish has that funk but also draws out with a fruity bitterness.\n\nThere's a reason why this is the top ranked triple. It's extremely delicious. I give it a 5.6 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev What a Triple. Looks slightly hazy, a slightly orange color with a big head and plenty carbonation. Has a sweet and sour aroma with more spices than space to praise this fantastic aroma. The taste is tart and sweet. The best blend of a triple I've ever had and it used to be one my most sought-after beers. Not sure if I missed this or never wrote a review. The spices are really incredible. Not sure how this could be improved. It's not too sweet and a joy to drink. I shall get more of this and keep this in the aging case. BB date 01/07/24. A 750 ML bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clove, citrus rind on the malty nose. Pear, apple &amp; banana on the hoppy palate. A little toastiness and caramel here and there. Medium body, medium plus, a little sour acidity. \n\nEasy drinking with decent depth to sip on.",

It is sweet and slightly resinous and is extremely easy drinking for it's 8% ABV. I hope they continue to make it as it is one of my favorites from this brewery. Excellent!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, at a breakfast joint in Petaluma. Deep golden to orange colour, large off-white head. Aroma and flavour of citrus, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Maybe a bit too far out on the sweet side for me, but still a fairly nice beer. Some alcohol in the finish. Anyway, I wouldn’t say that it sucks.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The name sounds like its referring to the brewery, with a bit of self-deprecation, but it's really about 2020. But this beer is the opposite of 2020. It's a dry-hopped DIPA with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. Lagunitas really hit the right combination. For a dry-hopped brew, it is a nice crisp bitterness. Checks all the boxes of a solid DIPA with big flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass an off white 1F head is formed. Beer is 95% transparent and mid gold in color with tons of fine particulate. Really interesting!\n\nOn the nose I get some mild onion, pine, salt, malt grapefruit pith and rind. The aroma is intoxicating!\n\nOn the palate, WOW, orange, malt, salt water effervescence that is thirst quenching and makes me want more. It is a bit candylike and sticky thick but I want more. The malty stickiness is balanced with relatively mild hops that are grapefruit and pine. The finish is astringent and cloying but I like it because it is mellowed by the malt.\n\nMouthfeel is thick and sticky, cloying and tasty. Some dryness to cut the malt on the end.\n\nI was not expecting this. I was expecting a hugely dank and super bitter beer with astringent roof peeling dryness. Not even close. Sweet candylike malt and restrained interesting hops make this a beer I will have again. A big tasty malty balanced hop bomb.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up a single from Total Wine for $1.99. I've heard a lot about this bottle for the past decade I've been a beer geek but this is the first time I've seen it in the wild. No discernable date on the bottle but some cryptic numbers printed on the neck. \n\nAppearance - Very hazy. Even with backlight can only barely make out the hazy silhouette of my hand. Small one finger white head. Irregular going from fine to pancake batter with variable bubble size. Good retention, decent lacing and stick. 4.25\n\nSmell - Grassy, sweet, lactic. Even a little floral. Interesting. Fairly weak for an Imperial though. 4.25\n\nTaste - Ho ho ho. Good kick in the mouth. Yet still soft and cushiony. Somehow has a strong, bold up front pretense but with no harshness or off tones or over-bitterness. Impressive in that regard. I appreciate it. Very unique. 5\n\nMouthfeel - No harshness. Yet bold. 5\n\nDrinkability - Extremely drinkable. Very sessionable for any beer let alone one at this ABV. World class easily, master crafted. No off tones whatsoever. No hiding flaws under strength. 5",

Sweet, but not balanced. Much more bitter.\n\nSticky, oily, resinous mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated. Smooth and easy-drinking apart from the drying and bitterness.\n\nComplex and predominantly hoppy in the weedy, dank direction. The alcohol isn't hidden, but it doesn't overpower. A very well-made dank DIPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle. No dating but the verbiage around the label talks about going to a brighter and wiser 2021. \nBrilliantly clear, deep gold colored body. Not much of a head upon pouring but a partial white cap covers the surface. Each sip leaves behind a tiny spot sheen of lacing. Quite the enticement to rotate the glass while drinking in order to get full glass coverage. \nAroma at a chilled temperature is hidden but bready malts and resinous hops come through.\nTaste is full. Slightly sweet but well balanced with citrus, pine, and resin. The suggestion of bitterness is swirled and tempered by the floral sweetness. Leaves a buzz in the mouth, and the aftertaste continues the back and forth, with a resin high note.\nMedium mouth feel. The stickiness of the resin also expresses in the mouth. Excellent carbonation.\nAs mentioned on the label, this is an excellent palate cleanser brew. Very expressive but without excess. Enjoyable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm not usually in the mood for an IPA, but when I am I usually look for one that is really well balanced. Some IPAs just bludgeon you with hops and bitterness. I like hops, I like bitterness, but I like them in measured amounts. Lagunitas Sucks nails it. This is GOOD BEER. Dark amber, almost caramel in color with a thick white head. Not much on the nose, a little floral, piney. Taste is spectacular. Hoppy, malty, botanicals and pine. Lightly sweet, and a nice light bitter finish. Medium high carbonation. Lighter body, but not wimpy by any means. I'll definitely grab this again the next time I'm in the mood for an IPA. I'm pretty blown away that this is 8% abv. It is so smooth and drinkable.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Jet black on the pour and in the glass and even my delicate pour prompts a huge light brown head to explode and pillow up, eventually relenting some and leaving awesome lacing behind\nAroma: Roast, dark chocolate, ethanol, roasted barley, bready notes, earthy hops, and blackstrap molasses\nTaste: Brown bread, baking cocoa, and roast jump out and tailed by wafts of alcohol heat which all hold for a second before earthy and slightly spicy hops come out to play. A little molasses and light brown sugar wafts are noticed in the background and closes with roast, chocolate, and booze along with a big bite\nMouthfeel: Full, somewhat silky, medium-high carbonation, and a very dry and robust finish\nOverall: I dig it. This beer is big and means business and you can tell both of those things right away. I hadn’t had this in years and it was like I remembered in that it’s a hoppy and big Imperial Stout that flexes its muscle throughout and is a well-made and good one as well. A must-try for Imperial Stout/Russian Imperial Stout fans and I’m glad that its cold outside as this one is definitely a belly warmer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack. Canned 9/25/21, so this beer is almost 4 months old. I had this in the fridge and allowed it to come up to room temperature before I cracked it open.\n\nLook: Pours out a very dark almost black color. There was a thick, rocky brown/dark tan colored head that slowly reduced to a thin layer, leaving behind some nice looking lacing.\n\nSmell: Smells nice. Intense dark chocolate, coffee, sweet notes of marzipan and vanilla and some booze. There are also secondary notes of dark fruits. It has a nice roasty aroma.\n\nTaste: Interesting. Up front, it is very dark and roasty and there are also some sweet pastry type notes (think brownies and chocolate cake). The finish lingers long and is more bitter than I expected - lots of roasted malt and there is a strong charcoal flavor on the finish. I think that there is a lot of bitterness and some oiliness from hops that is coming out in the finish. This beer definitely does not taste like it's 10.5% ABV, although I do get some warming in my chest as I consume more of it.\n\nFeel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and has a very interesting finish. I would say that it is a bit thin for what I was hoping for.\n\nOverall: I haven't had this beer in years. My old roommate and I used to split cases of this beer. It's definitely one of the quintessential American imperial stouts, and its availability has stood the test of time. I guess that my main criticism is that it doesn't taste as complex as some other great imperial stouts that I have had. Perhaps it would benefit from aging?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very beautiful stout. Slow rising, dark head. Notes of roasted espresso in the nose. Taste is candy caramel with coffee and chocolate. Very very bitter yet delicious and drinkable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack purchased at Super One Liquor in Duluth, MN.\nAn incredibly firm and deep stout. It is boozy, firm tannins, very dark with a dark tan head, roasty toasty, dark bitter chocolate and molasses. It has a lot of staying power on the palate and is staining. It's great flavors are bold and powerful overall and is quite excellent tasting. Amazing beer in a can.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Guess I'm too stoned or something lmao, I've had a solid share of imperial stouts now and this sucks to me. I taste sweet booze and nothing else. Maybe it's somehow still cold but I'll stick to breakfast stout, KBS, Expedition, Narwhal, idk dude this is somehow one of the worst I've had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One sip propelled this Imperial Stout into my top 3! I didn’t have to evaluate it. That’s a good sign. Seeing how dark it was, I expected it to be thick-n-chewy, sweet, and have a lot of alcohol burn. \nHoly shit!…It had more balance than an olympic gymnast and an exceptional roasted malt complexity which carried throughout the finish. I avoid canned beer at all costs, but I really wanted to try this one so I took a chance on it. Poured into a stout glass and cooled just long enough, I indulged. I expected the typical regret of a curiosity purchase, but instead I was thrilled at the discovery of a new favorite! Although I was amused by the name of this beer, it actually detracts from this seriously well crafted Imperial Stout.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 1800th review!\n\nAppearance - Pours a dark jet black with two fingers of frothy mocha tan head.\n\nSmell - earthy, leafy, and floral hops, coffee bean, roasted malts, dark fruits (raisin and fig), cocoa, and earthy yeast. \n\nTaste - earthy, leafy, and floral hops upfront. Then quickly goes into the bold coffee bean, cocoa, roasted malts, and dark fruits (raisin and fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew. \n\nMouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes velvety smooth with the bold coffee bean and cocoa with a nice lingering alcohol warmth. \n\nOverall - A stellar imperial stout that has been on my radar for quite some time. If you come across this don't leave your local liquor store without a can or two. A pleasant sipper.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This shouldn't take more than a twelve ounce can poured out and into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. It's expresso black-brown with a tidy tan head that is lasting. There's a strong aroma of roasted malt which is influenced noticeably by oak tannins. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes. The ABV is high and somewhat noticeable, so that may also put off some. Overall, this is an obviously great example of brewing craftsmanship. But when you go this boldly, not all will follow.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours opaque jet black with a thin but persistent tan rim.\n\nHeady nose of malt, molasses, pumpernickel and black figs.\n\nPalate is massive.

Some sweetness but the bitterness lingers right through the long finish.\n\nVery full bodied with minimal carbonation, unctuous mouthfeel, lovely lingering bitterness, lot of warm alchohol. Beautiful savoury beer.\n\nThis beer ages really well. Mellows some of the alchohol heat and the flavor marry wonderfully.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells sweet with malts and a lot of bourbon. That's really all that I'm getting.\n\nThe taste is like bready bourbon up front and then you get a rich coffee bitterness.  The stout coffee flavor and the sweet woody bourbon complement each other beautifully and provide for a balanced taste.\n\nThis beer is full bodied and smooth with just a subtle carbonation that gives it an even thicker feel. The finish is clean with alcohol and coffee.\n\nOverall this one is pretty damn fantastic. So balanced and the mouthfeel is great. I'm giving it a 5.8 out of 6... so good!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml can, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate chocolate brown head. Nice aroma of roasted malts / roasted barley, chocolate, coffee and bakery. Intense flavour of malts (malty sweetness + heavily roasted malts/barley), notes of strong coffee, molasses and dark bitter chocolate, ending in a distinct bitterness (both from the hops - 98 IBU - and the roastiness). Possibly the most awesome canned beer in the world.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I love this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A nice viscous, creamy mouthfeel with lots of dark roasted malts and malt-molasses sweetness. Dark chocolate and coffee are present with a mild bitterness that balances it out. This is definitely a top notch imperial stout."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 75cL corked bottle into the biggest glass I have, a spieglau American wheat beer glass and It barely fit. A dark murky brown red letting almost no light through. On the pour I got a 2 finger head that started overflowing. After a little while it disappeared to nothing. Not all that carbonated looking.\n\nSmell is very yeast forward with fruit notes and some alts coming through. Very similar to a dry wine with grainy notes very heavy smell. Some alcohol.\n\nFlavor is quite similar to the nose but malts are much more present. Still some acidity and fruit notes mixing with the roast to make it a bit winey. Very dark and fruity beer at the same time. Some alcohol is detected but it seems to compliment the beer at warmer Temps (20 mine out the fridge). Very nuanced beer.\n\nFeel is a bit thinner than I would've expected. I thought it would be thicker from all the grain that went into it. Buy its still very nice and almost easy to put down if it wasn't so big with the flavor.\n\nOverall, its a very interesting beer with lots of flavors to explore. This beer is pretty extreme to the point of giving me wine vibes, but still at its core beer. This is my first experience with a real belgian ale other than an old bottle of duvel a long time ago so I don't know all that much about the style. However I enjoyed this beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Some fluffy, beaten egg white foam forms over a deep copper, almost brown body. There's some sediment floating about, but not as much as anticipated considering I can't remember how long ago I purchased this bottle. Been meaning to pop the cork for awhile now. Smells super bready and yeasty, but not in the way you generally find typical of Belgians. This is its own thing, at least to my nostrils. Lots of sweet, dark fruit; figs. Also some fruity notes you wouldn't necessarily expect with raspberries standing out to me. Smells fookin' great. Tastes it as well. Not as good as implied by the nose, but very tasty all the same. Yeasty up front with a fruity middle and a bready finish. Nowhere near as boozy as I'd assumed with something of this octane. Low carbonation suits this beer very well. Complex yet easy drinking beer = big thumbs up from me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Poured from. 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 60 degrees. One finger tan frothy head. Dark opaque brown color. Frothy lacing just stays on the glass walls\n\nS - dark fruits like cherry, raisins, etc. and sweet bread malt scents.\n\nT - taste follows scent with sweet bread and dark fruits. Some alcohol comes through at 10% ABV, but it’s more balanced and easy to drink than you would expect. The lightest of a floral hop bitterness in the taste. A little smoky/toasty cola comes through on some tastes as it warms up. Agitating it half way through brings back the sweet flavors. The complexity is great.\n\nF - frothy and great thick mouthfeel. Solid carbonation. \n\nO - This is a great beer. Obviously at 10% ABV this is a one drink and done. But the scent and flavors are excellent. Nice complexity with each taste and smell. I really enjoyed the fact that agitating/swirling partway through brought back the initial flavor and scent profiles. All in all, even at the higher ABV, I drank this one pretty fast as I kept going back for different tastes. Highly recommended as I add this to my annual rotation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep ruby, two inch off tan head that fades after two minutes\n\nRum soaked deserts, malt, bread, raisin on the nose. \n\nThe look is strong, aromas fairly decent, but the drink is where the beer is, as described, formidable. Tastes of sugared bread, dried fruits such as raisins and even dried candied melon and cherry. Powerful malt backbone that lasts for days \n\nGeneral alcohol warmth to the sip. Assertive mouthfeel with good carbonation. My beer hid the bitterness quite well, with the sweet malt notes winning every time. Might be due to this bottle being a little older (likely). \n\nAs it warms the beer opens up quite a bit. The malty, bready notes are even more prominent if that’s even possible. Once again that rum raisin alcohol warmness presents itself. What is harder to describe is the melding of multiple flavours and tastes that’s hard for me to pick out. I’d love to come back to this beer eventually. \n\nComplex, and even more so as it warms. One of those beers that deserves a revisit every year. I wish I could give this a better review; I chose this beer as its strong as we just receive news Russia has invaded Ukraine. A beer, a moment in time, I don’t think I’ll ever forget and will likely become a home for me and my memories in the future.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful look and scent to this classic. Big tan head, wonderful lacing. \n\nTaste of biscuits and prunes. Quite sweet, although that tapers as it warms. Heavy, with some alcohol warming. Big mouthfeel, malt that lingers for days. Excellent balance for such robust flavors.\n\nFormidable brew",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Overall: a triumphant beer that definitely stands out when you want a heavy beer but not a stout. It reminds me of old/stock ales but with less hops and bitterness. Tastes of raisin, rum, bread, and a slight pucker from prunes. \n\nGreat right ahead or right after the coldes of months, or when you need something to sip all night and a stout would be too much.\n\nI do think there may be better quads, but as of yet I haven't found one that tops Abt 12.\n\nLook: a dark mahogany brown that looks almost deep purple if not under light. Beautiful lacing with the a thick head that dissipates into a nice creamy top coating of bubbles. \n\nSmell:right up in your nose, this one carries a pervasive aroma though it's not heavy. I catch the smell of Belgian yeast (sharp/sour) and it's lovely.\n\nTaste: don't tackle this one when it's too cold, I enjoyed it after 40+ mins out of the fridge. Bold flavors that are balanced between raisins, prunes, rum, and dark bread.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful ruby/cola color poured with an off white head. Substantial and lingering. The smell is malty with hints of dark fruit. The first sip tells you a story. I am still new to tasting but even I can tell that this is exceptional. Sweet on the front end with dark raisin and toasted bread crust. Finished with a bitterness paired with a crisp clean bite. The mouthfeel is beautifully balanced with the carbonation. It’s a meal. I polished off a large pint +9oz bottle tonight in short intervals. I wish that o could fully appreciate everything that was going on with this and plan to revisit again in the future as my beer palate matures. Top notch beer and deserving of a world class title.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm not traditionally much of a Belgian beer drinker, and at $22 a 4 pack I was skeptical on the recommendation, however I must say that I am impressed the dark ruby and brown color and off white head lead to an aroma of wine and dried fruit on the nose, particularly red wine and cherry. On the taste it feels exactly that like that with a more pronounced flavor of sweet raisins rather than dry wine, which leads to a funky Belgian ale finish which is just intrigued. I'm just blown away at the complexity of this beer and the warmer it gets the more interesting it becomes, it is truly a unique experiance and I Highly recommend trying it once in your lifetime. Prost.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Actually first time to have this legendary beer. Draft in a goblet. Dark brown and hazy great lacing. Rich, toasty, malty, molasses, and rich smell.

After enjoying Abbot 12 I can fully appreciate its lofty status.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a Goblet from a fairly fresh bottle, at around 9° Celsius.\nMahogany colour, with light leather notes when seen in direct light. Nice foamy head, creamy colour, not very persistent but consistently present, if faint. Somewhat lacking smell with hints of floral characteristics, and that usual smell of Belgian yeast... but in the mouth? Oh dear... so many things to take notes of, the intensity is out of this world! Raisins, plums, strawberry and cherry, it's an explosion of dark fruits, with strong hints of chocolate and lighter ones of coffee dominating a somewhat bitter aftertaste. It's just... so balanced, and extremely drinkable, as the high alcohol content makes itself known only in the aftertaste, enriching the bitterness. Near perfect!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep, opaque chestnut-brown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4, 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap. These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.\n\nBoth strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.\n\nAs with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.\n\nBody leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour. \n\nIt’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've had a few really good Belgian ales before, but this one is very close to being my favorite.\nReceived via trade from @Providence and boy, do I owe him for this.\nPoured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.\nAroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon. \nThe date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!\nThe feel, well, excellent. Almost, but not quite, viscous.

Maybe even a nice sweet bread.\n\nT - Some alcohol in the front along with the malt. Slight chocolate, possible cola. The dark fruits and port wine are in there as well. Good complexity overall, so that each taste can find some slight variation\n\nF - Nice high carbonation with a full frothy mouthfeel.\n\nO - Overall, this is an excellent beer.

Has some balancing bitterness, but it is barely noticeable. Alcohol is noticeable, quite upfront, but it is 11% ABV. It is amazingly drinkable for a high carbonation, 10% plus ABV beer.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a translucent copper/burnt orange color, with a fast receding foamy whit head. Smell mild hints of toffee and vanilla. Taste is bready,malty and nicely hopped. This is a tasty beer.Feels almost thin bodied,finishes semi dry. Overall this in my opinion is a different brew than 35 years ago when they were trying to make a name for themselves. This was my go to beer and if I moved to another State that did not stock it , I would tell the owners how fantastic this beer was. ( I may as well have worked for them) it was the best beer, (also Anchor Steam) at the time in the US market- This seems like a cheapened version on every level of ingredients. It was a beer I would have rated a 4.5. This on the other hand shows what mass production can do to quality of ingredients. Last time I drank this ,SAM Adams was trying to impress, now they are a small conglomerate who makes mediocre beer. Sad that success destroys the product-",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Only pick this beer up when it's very fresh. I wouldn't even recommend picking this up if it still has 2 months left on it's freshness labeling. Big fluffy head that lasts throughout the beer. Well balanced malt and hop flavors. I swear this beer used to be under 5%. Either way it's miles ahead of the majority of craft attempts.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a beer that I could drink over an hour or 45mins. It has a nice color to it, and a crisp flavor that hits your tongue right away. Had a dry feel to it with some bitterness at the sides of your mouth. You can definitely taste the hops, leaving it more honestly bitter than I expected and some spice notes with that. The IBU rating will deceive you. It taste like an inoffensive beer with a strong hop flavor. Was excited to try this and it disappointed. Not bad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle (beers for cheers)\nThe look is a nice solid to light amber with average carbonation. Head on the pour isnt spectacular, but what does form sticks around for a while. Crystal clear\n\nHops are very present on the nose, but almost all bittering hops. Very classic hop scent blending very well into the malt backbone. Very pleasant scent. Herbal earthy and malty.\n\nTaste almost resembles a pale ale. Hops largely overpower any lager characteristic, much unlike their winter lager. Still easy to put down and inoffensive but much more bitter than most lagers I've had despite the claim of 30 IBU on the bottle. Wish the malt was stronger on the taste. It does come through in the after taste though. \n\nFeel is like most lagers easy to put down not too heavy and pretty refreshing the strong hops detract from refreshing as much but that's not a huge deal it came in a winter pack.\n\nOverall a pretty good hoppy lager. Choppier than a traditional pils, but nothing crazy. Flavors are all ones you've had before, but maybe not in a lager. Pretty good definitely better than most macros flavor wise but maybe not refreshing wise.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle\n\nPours two fingers of extremely pillowy, creamy white head. Retention is immaculate, not losing even a sliver after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks nice. Body is bronze in color, crystal clear, with an absurd amount of nucleating bubbles coming up. Looks wonderful so far.\n\nNose is bready, some caramel, toffee. Faint grassy hops, even a little spicy. Malt forward, but it doesn’t smell cloying or overly sweet. The aroma is fuller than what a lot of Vienna’s often have, so you could argue it’s stylistically closer to a Marzen. Just slightly complex, smells wonderful.\n\nOn the flavor, the malts seem to hit harder and the hops take more of a back seat, especially compared to drinking from the bottle. Definitely bready, caramel, toffee. Hops are pretty subdued, there is a very small spice that I feel shows up more out of the bottle. Definitely leans more towards a Marzen, at least from my experience with the two styles. You could say it’s just slightly unbalanced, but overall a lovely flavor.\n\nSweetness is moderate, but it works. Bitterness is low but present. For the amount of nucleation, the carbonation has held up very well, sitting around medium-high. Body is about medium, the malty sweetness does some work there. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, a tad sweet (at least in the glass, drinks much crisper out of the bottle).\n\nAll things considered, the drinkability is wonderful, this is tasty, not cloying, and light enough.\n\nAppearance turned out great. The head was super resilient, and the lacing very cohesive.\n\nOverall a wonderful beer, one that is underrated, or maybe just forgotten. Full of flavor, and just all around good.",

Fair amount of active carbonation at rest.

I’m a huge fan of Lagunitas and love several of their IPA offerings but never had tried their original IPA; I figured it was time to. The head and smell of this brew is so delightfully refreshing and tantalizing. This is definitely the most balanced IPA I’ve ever drank. It’s not hop loaded nor malt loaded…it’s just a very balanced, mild IPA, with an overall nectarine/peach flavor to it. Definitely a wonderful session IPA that I will drink again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear, coppery-yellow colour. A one finger head bubbles down into a spotty yet creamy cap.\n\nIncredibly unique aroma that I have not encountered in the 73 beers I’ve reviewed so far. Earthy, grassy, floral and a bit savoury. I’m thinking this is due to the crazy amount of hop and malt mix in here. Hoping there is a nice mix in the palate rather than a haphazard one. Biscuity malts and straw, pine needles and dried fruit leaves.\n\nPleasant malt biscuitiness on the front of the tongue and a light pleasant bitterness on the back end that is mildly piney and just a bit citrusy. Grapefruit mostly. Pleasant mix of both and the malt and bready flavours shine out quite well.\n\nLightly bitter body that is pleasant with a bready aftertaste, this leans towards a lighter body with medium carbonation that is pretty classic. \n\n43 hops and 60+ malts, wow. I’d say this leans to a more homogenized taste but it’s still nice and subtle and varied. Definitely not homicidally hopped, maybe at one point when it first came out. But it’s great to have it to remember what benchmark, typical IPAs tasted like, both years ago and historically. They were nowhere near as hopped as they are now, and this provides a great benchmark for what IPAs, and even APAs in reference to IPAs should/used to taste like. \n\nIt’s great and classic, very enjoyable. Our taste buds might be scorched by modern beers these days, sort of like how hardcore smokers with tarred up palates would drink the most peated, explosively fiery scotches and claim they barely taste it! It’s still very classic and enjoyable, much more than the average beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a semi-clear amber color with off white head and good lacing. Smells of biscuit, malt, dried fruit, very fresh with no skunkiness.

This is a really good beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is the IPA that turned me onto IPAs. Before Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada Pale was my &quot;IPA.&quot; I liked Lagunitas so much, that's pretty much all I drank and scarcely ever touched Sierra ever again... I tried everything from Lagunitas, Little Sumpin, Maximzizer, etc. and their seasonal selections. I drank it all until I literally couldn't anymore. I started to hate beer. I couldn't go back to Pale or Lager or anything. If it was beer, I literally couldn't drink anything but Lagunitas. So I switched to whiskey and it was perfect and I lost like 30 pounds from not drinking beer and I didn't look back for a long, long time, maybe 2 years. By the time I came back around to beer drinking, there was this whole new world of craft IPAs that were almost all better than Lagunitas. Lagunitas had become the &quot;IPA&quot; of Budweiser. I still enjoy it once and awhile and appreciate it--but much like I can hardly ever drink a Sam Adams ever again, I will be the same with Lagunitas now. It opened me up to a entirely new world of beers, but at the same time, I think the industrialization of it ruined it forever...",

I'm finally getting around to reviewing it after drinking this brew again. I have to say: I absolutely LOVE Lagunitas, but this is the first time in a while I drank their standard IPA instead of one of their limited brews.\n\nLooks - Nice, golden amber, clear. Nice white head, sticks nicely, and looks rocky and textured.\n\nSmell - Orange peels, citrus, light floral aromatics mingling with some vegetative aromatics.\n\nTaste - Taste nearly follows the nose. Lemony, highly citrusy, and orange peel notes. Floral doesn't come in taste. Some biscuity malt toward the finish. Nice balance between hop bitterness and malt.\n\nFeel - Mildly effervescent, not too heavy of a body. Not light-bodied either. Slightly sticky.\n\nOverall, I love this brew. I love it not just for the nostalgia I have with it. After trying it again for the first time in a long time, I really like the taste. A good IPA with a nice balance between hop and malt. While I do prefer their more experimental brews and hop-forward offerings, this is a nice brew to break up some of that and offer the maltiness that you don't get with some of the other offerings. Very good, main downside is that the hop notes aren't too varied. A straightforward IPA, which honestly is not a bad thing at all.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great IPA for people who want to start drinking these types of beers. I really enjoy how smooth it it but still gives the reminder of the hops.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle into pint glass.\n\nL: Like an IPA. Amber and transparent, small-ish head but good lacing and lots of carbonation.\nS: A hop bomb from the moment it opens. Mainly resinous, a little citrus, dank.\nT: Follows the nose. Opens up to reveal a little orange peel/citrus flavor. Strong bitterness to finish.\nF: Sticky, settles to bitterness in the finish.\nO: A fine IPA. Real hopheads will probably outgrow it quickly but it's a fine standby if it's on tap somewhere.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A friend gave me a bottle 355ml at 6.2%.\nPoured into glass 1finger head .\nSmooth and creamy nice balanced tropical fruit flavors very low bitterness level makes. It very easy to drink .\nOverall a very good IPA not that sweet which I like from the Lagunitas brewery in California.\nDefinitely buy this again \nCheers.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Imperial pint can into an imperial pint glass.\nL: Pours clear bright copper amber with a fluffy 2.5&quot; off-white head with good retention. Good carbonation remains throughout the pint. Some thick spotty lacing.\nS: Lightly floral, orange, tangerine, melon, bread.\nT: Spicy tropical hops, bread malt, pine, caramel, cereal grains, bread crust, brown sugar, lemon peel. More malt accents as the beer warms. It is moderately sweet and has a pine finish.\nF: Clean medium-bodied mouthfeel that is a bit juicy with a medium length finish. It is not dry.\nO: A delicious West coast IPA that isn't complex or challenging to the palate. With superb drinkability it is excellent in it's style."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very pale, clear gold appearance. Large, white, rocky head. Grapefruity hop aroma. Medium-bodied. Tastes of wheat &amp; hops.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Nearly clear orange in color with a frothy white head that builds and holds as a lid, slowly receding and leaving good lacing behind\nAroma: Pine, oranges, sweetened strawberries, ruby-red grapefruit, wafts of blueberries, sweet bready malt, and gooseberries\nTaste: A huge mixed berry blend comes together and starts it off, soon followed by a sweet orange-led citrus hit. Pine and fresh baked bread weave in and out of the picture throughout and closes with berries, malt sweetness, and a light bite\nMouthfeel: Full, quite smooth throughout, medium-high carbonation, and fairly soft on the finish\nOverall: I dig it. This is, and has been for years, my favorite of these folks’ offerings and unlike in my past, probably one of the only ones I still buy on occasion. When this beer is fresh, like this one is, it’s a winner with lots of nice hop flavor/aroma and the wheat malt component gives it a silky mouthfeel that rounds it out and keeps it from being sharp at all. A tasty hoppy pale wheat ale and one of the best, IMO",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very streamlined. As solid as it gets. Very hoppy but the right amount. The floral notes are pretty much perfect. Very nice with a video or a movie. I will definitely drink a pack of this a few times a year.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Right hoppiness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L- Medium gold color with about 85% transparent with a light cream colored head that fades fast with scant lace.\n\nN-A bit of toasted barley and yeast\n\nT- A bit of salt, light dryness, and a hint of lightly sweet toasted barley. A touch of sweetness is coming through to balance the dry hops which are more like black tea tannin than bitter. A hint of some phenol is showing as it gets temperate, very light thymol.\n\nM- Clean and a bit dry on the tongue. Finishes nice with a bit of dryness. Carbonation is on the low side with super fine bubbles that integrate nicely. A bit of creaminess to go with the dryness.\n\nO- A beer that will see more attention from me. I like the balance and the hop profile is not citrus or pine and restrained.\n\nEDIT: I don't read reviews until I have done mine. I suspect you could replace my notes about barley to wheat. I have not had too many wheat beers maybe like 5, so still learning but I get it WHEAT and good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Easy to find. Easy to sip. Agree with others that the alcohol is masked well. Solid wheat beer blended with a smooth IPA. WHEAT IPA - refreshing and light on the palate.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev All of the hoppy flavor of an IPA with the smoothness of a wheat beer! Easy to enjoy whether you're a casual beer drinker or a fanatic. One of the best widely-available beers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured 12 oz. bottle into a wide-mouth tulip.\n\nLooks - golden, almost honey-like. Beautiful white head that leaves lacing on the glass. Not too transparent of a beer, but definitely not hazy at all.\n\nSmells - I pick up malt from the wheat. Not unlike a bread. Floral scents come in. Something herbal as well, pine? Attractive smell for sure.\n\nTastes - Not too heavy on citrus. I get a more floral-forward note. Malt comes in as it starts to go down. The finish is resin, piney, and slightly dry. Some spice is in there somewhere as well. Peppercorn fruit or grapefruit peel comes to mind. Well-rounded. Nothing seems out of place. I enjoy more citrusy and juicy IPA's over floral IPA's, but this isn't too bad. It doesn't scream IPA though. Alcohol is hidden nicely, though if you are a lightweight like me it does sneak up on you. There are tropical fruit notes in there, but I'm not getting as much pineapple as I'd hoped. Pineapple is such an interesting note to bring out with just hops and malt that I was excited to experience it. But, no, I'm getting notes which are more like mamay than pineapple, in my opinion.\n\nFeels - Amazing. Easily the best part of the beer. It is smooth. Slightly effervescent. Medium to light in body. Perfect because it doesn't lay too much on the tongue or linger too much on your soft palate. Doesn't feel heavy in the stomach.\n\nOverall, I can say this beer is highly enjoyable. I do prefer other Lagunitas offerings (Maximus, Super Cluster, Sonomica), but this is a very nice beer to change up your stock. Feels like a wheat, tastes like a wheat beer, but is overall more on the dry and dank side like you'd expect from an IPA. Not so much an IPA in my opinion though, more on the side of an American Wheat Pale Ale over a traditional, or even American, IPA in that you won't find too much of the citrus and pine or cedar from an IPA. That isn't a bad thing though. This beer is great.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smooth , hoppy and delicious!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Citrusy and not as bitter as their other ipas still solid bitterness but overal not as much solid beer would definitely drink again if in tap somewhere.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful white cap with lots of white lacing. \nAlcohol well masked.\nInexpensive.\nI can really taste the wheat then the hops hit but they are just right.\nSpent half the glass trying to classify. Did I pour 1/2 wheat beer and 1/2 an IPA?\nIDK how to classify this. But I'll have another please! \n-- mid way thru the 2d one- now that I know what to expect it really starts to come into its own. This is one you have to try and I would suggest having more than one."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's just not New Belgiums best imo, and it's not the greatest amber ale I've endulged into at the same range. I'd state an average at best.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Nearly clear reddish amber with a creamy looking head that retains well and eventually settles, leaving good lacing behind\nAroma: Freshly baked bread, light toffee notes, wafts of dough, caramel, lightly toasted grains, and some malt sweetness\nTaste: Caramel-dipped bread and tons of it starts things off as some doughy notes and toffee filter in behind. These components continue to develop and deepen along with some toasted grains and closes how it started\nMouthfeel: Full, pretty smooth, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and smooth finish\nOverall: I dig it. A classic in its own right and a tasty and well-made Amber ale to boot. Probably not too exciting for some but it’s a great no-nonsense, easy-drinking, malty beer that is nice to have readily available pretty much anywhere and inexpensive to enjoy",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great tasting beer. Smooth, malty, good carbonation, and really nice flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass at roughly 50 - 55 degrees. One and a half finger light tan head on an aggressive pour. Clear amber-brown color. Some lacing that fades. \n\nS - Sweet malt up front. Creamy/buttery scent. Some light bread as well.\n\nT - Taste follows scent with sweet buttery caramel malts. Light Biscuit. No bitterness, all straightforward flavor. A bit of toastiness as it warms up.\n\nF - Good buttery medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation.\n\nO - This is a good straightforward beer. The flavors are a basic caramel/biscuit malt, and there is no bitterness. This is a very pleasing beer that I would always choose ahead of the American mass market beers. In fact, I would classify this as one of my standard beers. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to everyone.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Color is a dark amber that is translucent. Pour was nice with a small head that dissipated really quickly, leaving little bits of disconnected lace on the glass. I noticed the aroma instantly while pouring with the phenolic aroma characteristic of a Belgian style ale. Taste is very crisp, and notably well balanced in terms of sweetness, bitterness, and yeasty flavors. For a bBelgian style ale, it is somewhat muted, but in a way I think works very well for an easily drinkable rendition of this style. Overall, a very solid beer, I think the only reason I haven't rated it higher is because the style in general is not one of my favorites.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev &quot;Enjoy by 4/24/22&quot;; drank 1/11/22 @ the Yarchives. \n\nSee-through orange appearance. \n\nA rough pour yielded a HUGE off-white head; frothy lace. \n\nWheat, mild citrus &amp; faint cream notes in the nose. \n\nCreamy, medium mouthfeel. \n\nWheat &amp; faint citrus flavors up front; mild caramel &amp; a slight yeast kick on the finish. \n\nA mild, easy drinker; not going to blow you away, but it will always do in a pinch.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The popularity of this beer it's a total mystery to me. It's not the worst beer I've ever tasted, but for the price, it is the worst beer I've ever tasted. And this Brewery makes a Trippel which is quite wonderful for the price.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This was my go-to when I was still in the states. Usual pour was from a 12oz bottle into a porter glass.\n\nLook: clear; almost more copper than amber. Decent head/lacing.\n\nSmell: complex. Slightly sweet with biscuit and caramel.\n\nTaste: pretty much matches the aroma. Almost a märzen, but just enough hops on linger to remind you that it's an ale.\n\nOverall: Ah, Fat Tire, I miss you. Nothing in Belize is even close.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I just bought a second six pack (about 2 months after the first) of Fat Tire 12 oz bottles. I bought both at Fred Meyers in Tacoma. Sadly, for the first six pack, all 6 were stale and 3 of them were just about completely flat with next to no carbonation. That was the first time I ever bought beer from the supermarket and the beers were stale! Fortunately, the 6 bottles I just bought were all fresh and very much carbonated. I poured into a 16 oz pint glass and a large and quickly dissipating head appeared with lots of carbonation bubbles. For an amber beer, the caramel malt is not the star, its flavor does not overwhelm the maltiness. Instead, the malt flavor blends well with the caramel flavors and the malt is perhaps a tad more prominent over the caramel. The beer is bitter but not too bitter and has some hop flavor and aroma but not too much. The malt/caramel flavors are the star of the show and the hops play a secondary role. I just brewed a 5.5 gallon clone of this beer (adapted from BYO magazine and Austin Homebrew Supply's clone recipes). Fat Tire's website claims that the beer is a balanced and easy drinking beer, that it is! For the clone recipe, getting the flavor balance right between malt and caramel malt is the hard nut to crack. I like the somewhat subdued caramel malt flavors in Fat Tire better than Alaskan Amber Ale and Redhook ESB. The fizzy, dissipating head is the one drawback for me. Maybe it is a tad too carbonated. I've adjusted my clone recipe to hopefully get closer to the real deal (less caramel 80L malt) and will brew it again in 2022. The Briess Carapils malt that I used in the clone resulted in better head retention. The Fat Tire tastes good and is very drinkable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: This classic pours a transparent amber with a head about two fingers in height.\n\nAroma: Bready, biscuity, floral hop with a slight dryness in the nose. \n\nTaste: Buttery, biscuity, light hop bite in the back. Fairly malt forward. Nice notes of caramel.\n\nOverall: I first had this well a long time ago and I enjoyed it. Years later I still do. It's such a great classic beer. Cheers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2021-12-01\n12oz bottle served in a tulip. Dated &quot;Enjoy By&quot; 07NOV21. If I thought it was &quot;off,&quot; I wouldn't enter this review.\n\nPours a clear amber color with a medium sized head. Smell is fairly yeasty/bready, grainy, with a bit of nuts and toffee.\n\nTaste is more in the nutty direction, less yeasty/bready, still fairly grainy. A little bit of a wheat flavor.\n\nMouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, it's perfectly fine.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear, rich amber from the bottle, big 2.5&quot; off-white head, very good lacing and retention. Nose is isn't too bright - light brown sugar, some earthy hop, a bit of brown bread. Even as it warms, the aroma is pretty muted and dissipate pretty quick. Flavor delivers more, though up front sweet - light molasses, agave nectar, light brown sugar. On the finish, however, there is some really pleasant breadiness keeps it from cloying. Mouthfeel rich and smooth. Overall, it's solid and serviceable and offers nothing offensive.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle.\nL: Clear, glassy amber with a thin, short-lived, off-white head.\nS: Very light malt.\nT: Sweet, lightly toasted malt with soft bitterness.

Didn’t finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark yellow color, thick frothy head that slowly dissipates with trace to little lacing. Pleasant light malty smell. Smooth taste with medium carbonation burn.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Rich cloudy orange with a humungous and silky-looking off-white head that balloons and settles around the edge, leaving a dome that refuses to settle, though eventually does, and leaves great lacing behind\nAroma: Clove, freshly baked wheat bread, yeast, banana esters, and wafts of bubblegum\nTaste: Huge wheat malt and wheat bread jump out and start to quickly develop depth as some clove and banana notes trail just behind. Yeast and bubblegum appear frequently throughout but don’t detract from the wheat/banana/clove but supplement them well and closes with wheat bread\nMouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, soft throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a smooth and soft finish\nOverall: This is so damn good and hands down the G.O.A.T. of Hefe Weissbiers in my opinion – the standard amongst which all others are compared to. Not only are the flavors and aromas all on point, but they come together to create a sum greater than its parts and literally flawless in execution. I wouldn’t expect anything different from these folks given their experience and longevity and glad to have easy access to it. Highly recommended",

It may not be contemplative, but it's fantastic to enjoy on its own. Treat it almost like a milkshake.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Yep one of my favorites. Nice copper hazy color with yeast sediment and a thick creamy head. Smells like banana, clove, and other spices. Has a white sourdough bread like smell as well. Taste goes along with the smell. Nice and bready on the order of banana spiced sourdough bread. It is refreshing and I tend to like it very cold. The mouthfeel is on the medium side. Light but creamy. Goes down like milk. Solid hefeweizen!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very smooth. But I question if it's too smooth. I don't notice immediately any notes of flavor typical with other Bavarian hefeweizens or witbiers. I like that there no strong overwhelming taste to it. It makes me consider drinking more while other witbiers may cause me to only want one. I wish there was more clove or banana taste, but the smoothness of it is what I wish others were like.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazy look (think of a hazy IPA), with a small foamy white head. Nice smelling aroma that has a lot of complexities. Baked goods and maybe even some sort of sweet smells too. This is amazing. The taste is something very new but classic tasting. There is a smaller tastes of semi-sweet fruits and spices like nutmeg and clove and maybe even cinnamon but without any heat. There are some medium-small notes that may be pastries without any major sweetness. Big notes of bread, wheat, maybe even rye, and pumpernickel. There is pretty much no bitterness from\nHops, but all the spice from it. Maybe there is even a little bit of orange zest. The aftertaste leaves a nice taste that could be matched with any food. There is nice amount of carbonation (low medium). There is a creaminess (think velvety) and citrus feel there too. Wow. There is so many complexities in this beer but it’s not too much.\nThis beer is Elite in every way. I’d want to give a 5 in every category, but only God above is perfect.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Notes of banana. Incredible",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Perfect look. Thick head. Great color. FULL bodied wheat beer. More spice than I like in my personal preference otherwise I’d give it all 5’s.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev will never forget the first sip I had of this beer. biblical.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Been revisiting old favorites to see how memory and current reality coincide...\n\nTried the 16 oz can for the first time, poured into some tall vintage Crystal pilsner glasses that belonged to my grandfather, still have a set of four of them left, they ping when you tap them, really old school fancy beer glasses... The beer is yeasty, cloudy old brassy gold in the glass, rises up a three finger head of off-white foam that lasts a few minutes with some moderate lacing. \n\nExcellent semi-sweet malt notes on the nose, fresh baked bread, along with the juice from a jar of Olives minus the brine, probably not the most appealing description, but that's what I always get with a wheat beer, must be my palate...\n\nMore semi-sweet malt and a nice medium mouth feel, not too heavy, absolutely no hop bitterness, and never tips over into a bubblegum sweetness that some wheat beers seem to have... I get a little bit of that olive juice flavor, which frankly as a Martini person is not unappealing, it's such an exact flavor to me that there's no other description... Don't let that description put you off though, it may recall something else to you... Absolutely perfect taste profile, something that I consider the ideal example of a wheat beer, the peak exemplar of the type. I only give five star ratings to a handful of beers and this one gets that five, Weihenstephener is as good as it was the first time I had it, so long ago. Plenty of other wheat beers over the years including some very strong American ones but this is still the absolute Pinnacle of the variety.\n\nLingers just long enough on the palate, with just the right amount of alcohol and just the right amount of weight to the mouth feel. Very fine carbonation, pinpoint bubbles, and not at all &quot;gassy&quot;, very natural feel.\n\nLeft quite a bit of lacing in the empty Glass.\n\nThe 16 oz cans seem to be the way to go in terms of value too. Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan is one of those breweries, like Samuel Smith out of the UK, whose whole range is consistently at the top of the available beer varietals...their Korbinian is a top doppelbock, neck and neck with Ayinger Celebrator, and I see they have a new Helles which I'm betting is going to be pretty good when I can get my hands on some.\n\nTo recap, probably the peak expression of a good German wheat beer, gets the top rating from me... and I still have three more cans there in the fridge! Does not overdo any one aspect of the style, is not excessively sweet, just a solid balanced Brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is the classical example of what a wheat beer should be. \n\nOm the nose - yeast, dough\n\nTaste - bready, malty, a little banana and bubble gum, but mostly wheat. bread, grainy notes.\n\nJust awesome beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Hefe gold standard. \n\nPersonally, I don't even bother with any other Hefe because I've tried a lot brewed both in Germany and America and the next best doesn't even come close. First off, if you order a Hefe and it isn't unfiltered you are drinking piss so don't waste your money. Secondly, American brewers never get it right, but I've had a couple (out of dozens) that try hard and are enjoyable nonetheless. Find Weihenstephan Hefe on tap and basque in it's perfection.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is one of two Hefeweizen beers I love. This thing pours hazy with a foamy head. You get this banana citrus nose that is intoxicating. This thing is complex with all the flavors present. Spicy, banana sweet, malty, citrusy, tangy, bready all at once. It’s refreshing and just plain great. If you like this you like Hefeweizenbier.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Deep, cloudy yellow with an almost too thick off-white head, with great complimentary lacing.\n\nSmell: Strong wheat and a hint of banana.\n\nTaste: Sweet, low bitter wheat taste with a light wheat and banana finish.

A slight biscuit taste within the malt profile and it is moderately sweet overall.\nF: Fairly creamy, smooth &amp; firm med-light &amp; mildly robust mouthfeel that is at first gently sharp then quickly mellow. It has a med-fast elegant finish that is gently drying at the end.\nO: A fairly simple and incredibly easy drinking clean tasting American IPA that is well balanced with an absolutely electrifying and pleasant presentation of cultured hops and smooth, sweet malts. A world-class American beer in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured deep gold with a large rocky head that sticks...around. Citrus and resin aromas hit my honker. Taste brings these scents to the tongue but, unlike a lot of others in this style, this beer packs a solid malt backbone more akin to a DIPA. Nice! \nMouthfeel is medium with the perfect amount of bubblies. As good as this is, it's not worth $5 a can at the local rip off beverage center.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This near perfect citrusy, bitter-ish, American classic Top Shelf ipa is definitely on the go to list for any real IPA lover. Body, head, lacing, aromas, flavors...all spot on the mark. Not old school, a True Classic . Just keeps on holding up as a great American IPA. Great to peel a clementine over the head/glass and throw. slice in to enjoy after the beer is gone. Very awesome.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Mix between a two hearted ale and an all day ipa. Starts with a floral malty sweetness with a hint of pine, malty mellow middle, finishes with a floral piney bittersweet finish. Excellent and I’m not usually big on IPAs.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hoppy IPA. Similar to 2 Hearted in its bitter finish. Perfect hoppy beer that is very cheap (near me) to put into rotation,",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Liked it overall but this beer fizzes out every time when I open the can no matter what the temperature of the beer. Have to put the mug in the sink and open it over it. Still manage to lost beer as it basically explodes into the glass. No wonder it came in a 15 pack because by the time I’m done it will have really only been a 12er due to the foamed up lost beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Featuring one of my favorite hops varietals, this rich amber drink offers a crisp, slightly sour bite at the front, that settles into an earthy straw-like exhale...the later more pronounced as it warms. Just enough bread on the bottom to balance this act with magnificence. A King's drink, indeed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I love this beer. i play the field, but always come home to this. A lovely clear copper color, fruity but not overwhelming smell, a bit of the oily texture that an IPA should have, and a perfect balance between malt and hops. And it certainly doesn't hurt that it's widely available in my area and quite inexpensive (15 12-ounce cans for about $18).",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer looks nice and smells nice when pouring, but has a bitter taste on first sip and the aftertaste is even more bitter. It is one of the least enjoyable IPA's I've had. The taste is what I describe as a &quot;burnt&quot; hop taste. Old and bitter and sour. If you really enjoy a bitter and sour IPA, this one is for you. Not for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Excellent beer. Thin mouthfeel with hints of orange and grapefruit. It's is a relatively subdued IPA but still great.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy copper with an eggshell colored head that leaves gobs of lacing behind. Huge aroma of pine, grapefruit and citrus. Flavors follow, with smome malty sweetness, medium bodied, great carbonation. This is a beer I always keep in the fridge.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From my experience with Two Hearted I seem to not care for these 100% Centennial IPAS. That being said this was decently refreshing",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not exactly a fresh can, 10-20 brew date.\nJust a beautiful glass - deep amber nearly garnet red in the shade with an off white head of dense sticky foam. Large smears and glyphs of lace cling all around the glass , great retention of a creamy ring of thick froth.\nThe aroma is all in the name. Classic centennial hop nose of conifer needles in a damp forest, rich caramel malt sweetness and a mild citrus and floral side bar. The smell fill the room.\nThis beer reminds me of SN Celebration every time I have it. Never had them side by side but it would be a great battle of the Red IPAs. I remember this being a bit more malt forward than this example- again - not quite fresh. There is good balance and the caramel / crystal malt flavors come through but the hop bite beats it back from mid swallow to finish. Rich malt up front loses ground to the crushed pine and grass hop flavors and bitterness. It could use a little grain complexity and malt balance - maybe this 19.2 oz can for the mass market is ultra filtered and some life has been stripped away from ... what it was when brewed in smaller batches.\nBody is a bit thin and lacks some sweetness and mouth feel but still a very tasty and satisfying IPA for me. \nThe finish is long and grassy, a slight warm from a tickle of alcohol with good hoppy burps.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells really sweet and a bit floral.  Much more like some lager than an IPA.\n\nIt is an IPA. It's a tame IPA but still an IPA. Up front it's sweet and malty but then a lot of bitterness comes in.\n\nThe mouthfeel is very thin and there's a lot of suds.  It finishes with floral notes and a good amount of long lasting clean bitterness.\n\nOverall it's a subtle but really good IPA.  I give it a solid 5.1 out of 6.",

Moderate lacing to the end.\n\nAroma of pine, grapefruit, tangerine, floral.\n\nTaste is spruce, grapefruit zest, tangerine, resinous.\n\nMedium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.\n\nAnother outstanding IPA from Founders.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing beer, great taste, not too heavy for a 7.2‰, easily drinkable, price point is always amazing for the abv. My go to IPA, I would go as far as to say my bar for IPA's.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nose is all citrus. I don’t know a ton about hops but obviously centennial is the least bitter of the bunch because this beer completely lacks that bitter hop flavor present in most IPA’s. Not a bad thing, just different. Malt adds a nice feel to it. I enjoyed this one but I probably won’t buy it again because I tend to enjoy a more bitter hop profile. The flavor is a bit one sided and mostly provides citrus notes which is not really what I’m into.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is the third in my, currently 3-day long, intentional chase to bolster my Beers Of Fame list... now at 164. I suppose drinking this easy-to-find ale (released 19 years ago) gives away my bias: that I venture a lot less into the IPAs than most.\n\nThis also suggests I've been missing something. Drinking Centennial also gives me cause to speculate another theory about something I appreciate in moderation: that single hope ales like Centennial are both difficult for the brewer and the drinker. For the brewer, too many single hop brews require them to blend the malts better to meet the narrow range of what a single hop does. (So to keep it simple, the brewer blends the hops to meet the requirements of the malts.) On the other end, drinkers don't get the variety of sensations of multiple hops -- yanking our buds from sweet to bitter -- and, instead, have to work with our buds to appreciate a narrower range of differentiation. \n\nAll that said for a purpose... Centennial achieves what too few single hop brews achieve: it gives a variety of sensation from one hop, the Centennial. That, at least, is my theory. What think you ?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sample from bottle at Vectura-messe. Orange colour. Aroma of crystal malts and orangey American hops. Sharp hoppy flavour throughout. Not particularly impressed by this one."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I tried this brew a couple of years ago and remembered that I really liked. Today is the first time I have seen it back in stock at my local beer store so of course I had to try it again. I'm a fan of dark bourbon beers and this one ranks right up at the top. The initial pour unveils a dark amber ale with a short lived frothy head. The smell is sweet with an obvious bourbon scent. The first taste is remarkably smooth and rich, sweetness on the tongue with a mild pleasant bitterness arriving at the end which left me craving for my next sip. Ahhhhh, so yummy! This is a first class sipping beer that you should keep on hand for your favorite house guests...if your the generous type.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled on 09.27.21 - 2nd try on this one, which drives this very review - found the barrel taste too strong &amp; fresh-coopered first time, but impressions seem to be diminished this round...)\n\nPour into 5oz snifter leaves an appealing bubbly tan head reducing to cloudy mists on the surface with a bubbly creamy little ring surrounding the fill line. Color such a lovely translucent deep burgundy. Nose is barrel woods, sweet molasses, perhaps a nuance of tangy fruitiness in there too. Taste is a lovely bittersweet, a little tang &amp; fizz on the tongue. Swallow is bittersweet, not overly sticky.\n\nI can see why appreciators like aging this one. It's a sweet lil' treat.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Superb scotch ale",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fairly dark body, browinish burnt copper color with a decent light tan head. Very pretty aroma: caramel, vanilla &amp; bourbon. Sweet with just of hint of bitter. Very tasty: caramel, brown sugar, spices, bourbon, scotch, ripe dark fruit, vanilla &amp; oak barrel flavors. Medium feel, good carbonation &amp; a fair amount of alcohol heat in the mouth &amp; stomach. Excellent scotch ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This sample was bottled 9/28/12. Poured into a 16oz nonic, a tan off white head forms and quickly dissipates leaving a light cap of foam on top. The color is a slightly translucent reddish brown. The smell is of boozy roasted malts, bourbon and candied dried fruit. The taste is slightly sweet, boozy malt, with notes of dried fruit and bourbon. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly slick. Given the age of my sample I assume the carbonation has toned down from the original packaging, the mouthfeel is smooth. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I would definitely buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev When compared to KBS it is a step lower. BUT - that does not make it undesirable. If you are a connoisseur of ales you will love it. If not - the pilsner people and BudNiks will notice the bloaty feeling and over-handed sweetness and put it down around a stale Oh Henry. Newbies will be hypnotized - the Seasoned will say &quot;meh.&quot;",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a fantastic dark beer, especially considering you don't have to go to a boutique micro-brew in order to get it. It's available at my local grocery store!

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great beer for the days when you worked out and feel you deserve a reward. I like it cold. I love malty brews and this one doesn’t disappoint. Smell is what I’d expect from a Guinness Extra Stout that was dark brown rather than black. Pour is like any well brewed beer and the taste is malty with a touch of sweetness. The finish is long and pleasant. A nice beer to drink with medium swallows to enjoy the feel and lingering graininess. Hard for me to find, but when I see it, I buy it!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This used to be my favorite Wee Heavy. I've bought a couple of 4-packs of this over the last few months from a packy in Putnam, CT. The whiskey flavor is overpowering in these 4-packs. I can barely recognize that it's a Wee Heavy. I mean, it's like Wee Wee Wee Wee HEAVY. The whiskey flavor is so strong, that I might never buy this again. Seriously, it used to be among my favorites! Bummer. There are just not enough good Scotch les out there.\nI wonder if the distributor unloaded a few cases of BWB mistakes on this packy, which probably has a relatively high percentage of customers that buy nips as opposed to beer connoisseurs.",

But, taking one for the team, I took a sip that was bottled on 05/13/21, poured into a nanobrewery's tulip glass, such as those are.\nThe taste is of the wee heavy variety with a barrel-aged chocolate tongue and a cookie-like texture going down. Another sip. Yep. Wee heavy. And there's a foamy surface with great lacing, sticking to the glass in the shape of a swirl. The mouthfeel is medium-thick delicious.\nI think I got a good batch.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I suppose I'll contradict myself and say that I'm not overly enthusiastic about beers with ramped up ABV scores. Too often, I find that the pleasure of the mouthfeel is compromised when the main thing you taste is the octane. With that said, I'm always impressed by beers that are a little stronger but bring the complex flavor into the foreground. Seems like that's the kind of thing &quot;craft&quot; is all about. I do love the Tröegs company and their creativity and sensibility, but I don't love all their beers (which is no knock on them at all). But for my money, Nugget Nectar is some of their finest work. It's such a pleasurable beer to drink; flavorful with a kind of well-earned sweetness, beautiful balance of the different hop notes and malt, and a stunning color in the glass. Over the years, I've cycled through a number of Tröegs beers, giving many a try, but I'm finally prepared to say that this is my favorite of all I've tried.

To me, its essentially an American Barleywine - but a really well done one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drank way too much of this when on tap locally, outstanding compared to any bottled version previously.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Tell you a story.,. I used to have keg parties in my backyard long ago and far away. Live music, BBQ, tackle basketball, etc.\nIt would get to about 10 PM and everybody was feeling right. Then my friend Daniel would show up with a jug of Wild Turkey and everything went to shit.\nSo nowadays, I be sitting with my beer buds (or beer and buds as it were, having lain down liquor 16 years ago) and long about 10:00, I’ll whip out a couple of 120’s and split ‘em up in tasters, pass ‘em around. Cheers!\nEverybody gets goosebumps, cheeks turn red, and they make ‘that face’. (I truly mean that in the most complimentary way.)\n\n120 Minute IPA is an Extreme Novelty that always satisfies. Sweet and hoppy, boozy and offputting, lowbrow and dispicable - yet the most underrated beer in America.\nIt’s a nipple pinch - whether you like it or not, you know you got pinched. \nCan you dig that?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Super boozy. Surprisingly dark. If you’re into IPAs you gotta give this a try. Bottled 08/2020",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass (snifter) at 60 - 65 degrees. One finger off-white head on aggressive pour. Opaque medium honey color. Inclusions present when held up to bright light. Good lacing and has alcohol legs. With a swirl/agitation mid-way through drinking, the head returns and fades to a thin foamy layering with lacing and alcohol legs returning. \n\nS - Light hops of a floral and citrus nature. Sweetness from a molasses. A little bready/biscuit scent mid-way through drinking it.\n\nT - Very complex. Malt and Molasses comes up front and the hops are in the back on the finish. Light bitterness on the finish. Minor caramel hints in there. Overall low bitterness and flavors mask the higher alcohol. Very surprised with the complexity and balance of flavors causing each taste to find something a little different. As with most high alcohol beers, the alcohol becomes more present as you drink and the beer warms up.\n\nF - Mild carbonation. Very smooth to drink. Slightly crisp finish.\n\nO - Overall this is a top notch beer. Perfect for planning your evening around drinking just one. The complexity in the flavors have me guessing whether I’m going to get more malts or more hops with each sip. This is definitely in my yearly rotation and comes highly recommended.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sweet. smooth but still bitey. Slightly hoppy, very boozy. Good beer to split with my husband.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Apple juice orange brown copper color. With a thin head and lots of suspended sediment.\n\nSweet alcohol smell and spice on the nose. It almost smells like a dry sake.\n\nFist sip is heavy on the alcohol. It’s sweet from the alcohol content but then there’s the typical piney resiny flavors you expect from a Dogfish IPA. But mostly this one is dominated by the alcohol flavor.\n\nFeel is kind of heavy and also dominated by the alcohol flavor. Not a ton of carbonation.\n\nThis is a fun beer to try for the novelty, but I think the 90 minute has better flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy amber with an almost nonexistent ivory colored head.\n\nTastes almost like a citrus barleywine. I was pleasantly surprised by this as I don't generally care for IPAs. It has the rind of tangerines and grapefruit mixed in with what I can only describe as barleywine. Wonderful it is. The alcohol is very mild considering the ABV, so be careful.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm biased. When I can get it, this is my go-to beer. Yes, it's expensive, but you really only need to drink one, so there's a certain bang for the buck. The potency of this brew is itself very attractive to me, because it puts me exactly where I want to be in one shot.\n\nThe booziness is very present and it's very hop-forward, but I consider this to be a surprisingly well-balanced beer. The secret is a very sweet malt. Some might not appreciate the aggressive flavor, but it really suits me. You're entering YMMV country here. If you're willing to scour the hills and shell out cash for an utterly uncompromising beer, then you'll enjoy the 'hundred-twenty, but others will balk. But the only time I'd pass up a bottle is if I've already had one...or two.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev At last! 12oz bottle from my brother. Copper colored pour with a lasting fluffy, off-white head. Sweet malty, boozy aroma. Taste initially starts with some caramel, then hops, before being obliterated by the ABV. Malt-bomb and hop-bomb....double whammy!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours amber with a 1&quot; ivory colored head, which slowly fades. Heavy lacing.\n\nAroma is toffee, molasses, pine, hay.\n\nTaste is caramel, toffee, raisin, dates, figs, pine.\n\nFull bodied, moderate carbonation. Semisweet finish.\n\nOutstanding! Although, unusual for an IPA, Dogfish has a winner in this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I recognize that I am late to this party; having 15 from Dogfish, but having avoided the 120 Minutes... being a malt-head.\nBut, what was I worrying about ?\n\nWhat brought me here was that 120 is on BA's Beers of Fame. And while I had closed in on 2/3 of the Fames, I avoided the easy hoppy hits... and 120 is among them. So after I got a copy that was bottled two years ago, I cellared it until I was mature enough to appreciate better what it is that the hopheads want. I'm not sure I am truly more mature and still do not know what hopheads want, but now was the time to start. I popped its famous top. But first, a comment on what hot water does.\n\n120 Minutes is a long time to boil anything. From a culinary perspective, remember it is a long 10 minutes for fettuccine (which depends on the sauce) and 8 minutes to hard-boil an egg (one of the most nutritiously intense things you can eat.) So if you boil something 120 minutes, you better be producing something special.\n\nAnd of course, Dogfish did. 120 Looks like not IIPA I can remember seeing, a beautiful amber. The Smells, Tastes and Feel all are integrated by a dedication to using hops to balance malt. \n\nDespite this being my 16th Dogfish, I suspect I've never done them a micro-review... now into its second year of ownership by Boston Beer, the Big Popi of the craft beer movement. How that plays out will mostly be for the Good. For as a purchase, Dogfish understand brewing's depth. Dogfish is active in all three traditions (probably excelling in two.) It has combined brewing with thoughtful kitchen menus for 25 years and it built a 15 room Inn (brining in the British tradition.) And then, it opened a second shop in Miami, tourism central, just to prove its point. \n\nAll that said, I think that only a few second generation crafters (20th Century) are as visionary as Dogfish and, when the final analysis is done, Dogfish may be second to none. A good purchase by Boston. Cheers !",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A powerful citrussy hop smell has a little malt in the background.\n\nThat is a powerful wood aged taste.  There are a lot of hops and there is a sweet alcoholic taste.\n\nIt has a medium mouthfeel with a medium amount of carbonation.  The finish is wood and alcohol and it lasts a long time.\n\nOverall it's too overpowering but it's still pretty damn good.  I give it a 5 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 12 oz bottle into shaker pint glass.\nA: Pours a surprisingly dark golden hue with a 1/4 inch light tan head that quickly recedes.\nS: What an interesting aroma! White wine, white grape, earthy herbal notes, with hints of pine, caramel malt, and soft spice.\nT: Herbal earth notes, soft spice, caramel malt, white wine, white grape, and soft pine resin. Follows the aroma, but even stronger/better.\nM: Medium-heavy body. Slightly oily feel. Subtle and soft earthy sweetness. Lingers on the palate in an interesting heavy and yet light way at the same time.\nD: Wow, what an interesting brew! Such an interesting hop expression and complexity from the process. Ok, I just looked at the ABV... 18%!! No wonder I’m feeling it.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good milky texture, nice color, but the taste is rather muted. You get the typical coffee &amp; chocolate notes you'd expect out of a stout but it almost tastes watered down while retaining a thicker texture. Possible it's like this because I'm buying cans of it in the U.S. I'll update if I ever get the chance to drink a proper pint of Guinness in Ireland.",

Preconceived notions of too heavy happily did not come happen. This is good on a hot day.\nPair with meat pies, pork, stews and chocolate.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 14.9 oz can to stout glass. After watching it settle which is always an experience, you get a perfect black body with that nice ivory cap that sticks around and leaves a good deal of thick lacing on the glass. Smell is coffee, chocolate, and roasted barley. Taste is roasted grain, a bit of coffee and cream, Bitter up front and doesn't really sweeten up at all, it just kind of rounds off. Taste is muted some by the nitrogen induced by that widget. Feel is soft carbonation, creamy, yet light in mouthfeel. Just so easy to drink. Overall, just an excellent beer. Not overly complex, not the highest octane, but comfortable and traditional. I let it warm up quite a bit before drinking which helps bring out more flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Does anything else look like a Guinness? Nope. It's beautiful. Thought I should pop one of these classics for the Saint Patrick's Day Holiday. It's as smooth and yummy as I remember.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is the beer other beers wish they could be like. Best beer going!!! A damn great beer!!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look - Iconic. If you're at a bar you can look around and pretty much tell who's drinking a Guinness. The dark color and perfect head are noticeable from across the room.\n\nSmell - hints of coffee and chocolate mixed with a yeasty, bready goodness\n\nTaste - Creamy, hints of coffee and chocolate flavors. The bitter notes hit me first, but they tone down quickly leaving a nice hint of aftertaste.\n\nFeel - First time I had a Guinness I expected a &quot;meal in a glass&quot; but after drinking it, I have no idea where that comes from. Very light carbonation, so it's smooth going down and actually pretty light.\n\nOverall - Yummy, creamy goodness. Maybe not the best stout out there, but certainly the most famous and one everyone should try.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I like both Guinness stout and their extra special stout. Probably prefer the latter. \n\nThat being said, it’s a solid good dark beer. In the bottle, it’s more a porter than a stout. It’s easy drinking and straight from bottle is fine for tonight. Smooth, hint of bitter and malt, Guinness never sucks. Even their infrequent bad batches are good.\n\nJust wish it had a higher alcohol content.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a dark brown, decent khaki head, some spotty lacing. Nose gets some roasted malts, coffee. Taste is similar. Thin and watery. Not something I'd buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Still drink these on the regular, but prefer the carbonated &quot;extra&quot; version. Over the years I've grown a disdain for anything nitro, lending more a flat than smooth mouthfeel for me. Flavor is still great here, and the look of the pour is iconic.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 14.9oz nitro can into a pint glass. Coding no help in determining age.\n\nThere are few beers that can match the look of a properly poured pint of Guinness. It gets a 5 every time.\n\nNot much on the nose, a very faint coffee note.\n\nOn tasting, smooth, creamy, but with a significant bitter dry roast that is a bit jarring.\n\nMouth medium, finish that dry bitter roast. This is a lasting finish, one that I could do without.\n\nOverall, haven't had this out of a can before, on draught i dont remember the strong finish. Certainly not the same beer i enjoyed in the 70's back in England.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Dark creamy pour with light foam at the top.\nSmell: Coffee, chocolatey slight malts.\nTaste: Creamy, smooth light chocolate very delicious lactose. Very good sipper.\nFeel: Light bodied beer, almost no carbonation truly one of the smoothest beers there is.\nOverall: It's a great beer to start off with if you're getting into stouts.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The best beer. Better at bars though",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s really grown on me, and has become one of my favorite brews. Its such a beautiful looking and tasting beer. Tap is best, but the nitro cans are still absolutely delicious. Such a one of a kind beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev In my honest opinion, a traditionally poured guiness is one of the most underrated beers anywhere outside of Ireland itself. It competes with beers that sit at a significantly higher price point, and it is overall a remarkable beer for its respective price. I will admit; I am I little bit biased as stouts are my absolute favorite style of beer. However, it is a phenomenal go-to beer nonetheless.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from tap at a local bar. You can always tell if the pour is right because of the cascading head effect that goes on, very beautiful. Mouth feel is perfect. Head was long lasting and always there, as you would expect. Very dark in colour, as you would expect from a Guinness. Tastes of roasted barley, with a hint of chocolate and coffee. Again, it's a Guinness, you should expect a good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing beer. It is finicky though. If it’s just right it’s a 5/5. If there is bad head and it’s overall watery it’s probably closer to a 3/5.\nBlack appearance with a creamy head without a single air bubble. Smooth creamy taste that is so refreshing. A bit bitter in the back. Easy to put a couple of these down so be careful.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Worst I've ever had. Maybe I received a poor batch....yuck! Learn something from Samuel Smith.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from the nitro tall can\nThe look is absolutely beautiful with the nitro cascade and the pitch black liquid then the nice guinness head that sticks around forever no complaints here.\n\nSmell is quite light but creamy and dark with hints of chocolate. Quite a bit of fermentation character, and there isnt a whole lot more other than the malts. Quite light despite the color.\n\nTaste follows the smell but with a definitive note of dark chocolate but muted with creamy notes. Very drinkable almost a light stout. Has all the dark flavor but with less complexity and bitterness than other stouts.\n\nFeel is interesting because of the nitro. Very very creamy, and smooth going down. None of the bite from traditional carbonation though. I almost prefer that bite but that is up to personal preference. In my opinion it feels a little flat, but it's not the bubbles are just so tiny it makes a creamy texture.\n\nOverall a good beer, but the extra stout is better In my opinion. This one just feels a bit weak in flavor, and mouthfeel, but the mouthfeel is mostly just me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’ve had many a Guiness Stout over the years; both here in the USA and Ireland. Some say there is a difference, but both taste the same to me. Guiness is a solid staple."

This beer is good for sipping but is really quaffable for such a higher ABV%. Excellent overall and great that it needs no adjuncts to bring forth complex smells and flavors. It's a loss that this is no longer brewed.\n\nBottle Notes:\nBrewed in the authentic, historical style of an imperial Russian stout, this beer is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can - and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever-thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!",

Rich, dark roasted and grainy malt aromas with dark chocolate and earthy, tobacco-like notes and light booziness. Rich and full bodied with medium light carbonation and a velvety smooth feel. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Roasted malt flavors up front with notes of dark chocolate and charred grainy malt. Medium earthy hop bitterness through the middle followed by chocolate and dark malt flavors. Bitterness transitions to warming booziness to the end.

Smooth rich mouthfeel - notes of the booze - but a bit of that lingering coffee bitterness at the finish. Warm and inviting of another sip.",

Spice, bread, and fruit, with a mix of white grape, apple, and pear. Very effervescent and a nice, dry finish. Fantastic. Never disappoints.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a beautiful, clear pale golden-straw colour. Three finger thick white creamy head slowly compacts into a one finger, dense foam that lasts the rest of the beer.\n\nInteresting and subtly complex aroma, slightly sour aromas of gentle funkiness. Earthy, more like damp leaves and wood than a horse barn kind of funk. Yeasty esters play around with a slight bitter, floral and grassy hop smell. Subtle banana and cloves, typical of most Belgians. I might have an older bottle, but I swear there is a vinous, grapey smell as well on a deep inhale. A tiny bit of bready, toasty malt, but I find it takes a backseat to the sour viney damp smells.\n\nTaste is very subtly complex as well, very pale and gentle sourness on the tip. Earthy and moist like wheaty aromas. Some subtle yeast notes with the malt. There is a savouriness as well here. I’ll mention again I think my bottle is older, which has brought out some nifty aromas and I think tempered the flavours a bit and evened them out. Some bitter citrus peel is noticeable as well, and a pleasant bitterness on the finish that is semi-sweet, a bit viney, with a white grape like taste.\n\nI didn’t notice the alcohol as much as others. This is a light-medium bodied beer with good, medium level carbonation. Nice bittersweet, grapey and bready finish that is mostly dry. \n\nPleasant, complex, and easy drinking. I’d love to try a bottle that is super fresh just to compare. I’ll leave the review like this for now and hopefully come back soon!",

Really good-",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smells like a citrus and bread, maybe even a small bit of grassiness that is also in the flavor. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some bitterness in it but not bad, some small fruit smell and flavors along with malt and barley and breads. The alcohol is noticeable but not too noticeable, to me this is the perfect higher ABV taste, with bold flavors but not a whiskey taste. As you continue drinking it gets more and more enjoyable. Great beer. Not a note-able aftertaste. The feel is semi-heavy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smells sweet like honey as soon as I opened the bottle. A little banana as well. Tastes of banana and bubble gum. This beer is very carbonated and I feel it overpowered the taste. It is a good beer, glad I tried it but doubt I will ever buy it again due to price. I would love to try it on tap someday to see if it is less carbonated.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev As a someone who was introduced to Belgian ales from Unibroue's interpretations, I was excited to find one of the staples in my local liquor store. I had a great experience with the Chimay range and was looking forward to this one.\n\nNose: Mild, semi sweet malt\n\nIn the Glass: Well foamed or formed head, rises quickly to show it's pale golden shine. Great looking beer.\n\nPalate, Crisp, orange citrus, sharp bitterness that fades into a full body of well malted barley. Crisp and sharp but not bitter.\n\nFinish: That sharp citrusy body fades into a mellow alcohol and malt flavour.\nOverall I can see why people covet this Ale. Unlike Chimay and Unibroue's offerings you do taste the High ABV with this one, hence the 4/5 rating. Not perfect but a fantastic ale.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Goes down well, especially if you like letting off world record burps while drinking:) I find it too carbonated, however 8.5% makes up for this. Overall a nice tasting, fresh beer, but too pricey and overly carbonated. \nI bought about 100 of these little guys a few years ago when a supermarket chain made a print error in their catelogue and advertised them at less than half the normal price.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Half finger tan head. Dark cola color. Minor lacing. Some alcohol legs.\n\nS - Malty and boozy. Some dark fruits like an after dinner wine. Sweetness in there as well.\n\nT - Sweet with some spices in there. The spices were unexpected, but a great extra taste. Bready / Biscuity Malt. No bitterness. Some booziness, but not over-alcohol tasting at 9% ABV. Each taste changes a bit. Keeps you coming back for more.\n\nF - Good carbonation. Medium thickness on mouthfeel. Almost creamy with agitation to bring back the head.\n\nO - I really like this. Drank it at the beginning of Spring, but would be a great Winter / Fall beer. I loved the surprising sweet and spicy taste. Will definitely add this to the annual rotation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On draft at Iron Abby, Horsham PA. What a wonderful beer. Dark color with nice white head. I taste plums, raisins and caramel. Finishes so smooth.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer is a beautiful thing - a beautiful large head sitting atop a rich dark ale . With such a strong alcohol content it will certainly knock you out a bit but you wouldn't know it from the taste. Great fruity and caramel flavours - you can taste the history here. Not an every day drink but certainly good for a colder day of the week - especially if you have one of the wide Chimay glasses at home..",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours an opaque, deep dark brown with a slightly off white head that slowly grows to be over five inches thick. Over the course of a few minutes it slowly recedes to a creamy looking millimetre cap on top. Lovely looking beer.\n\nI honestly thought I smelled aromas before I unbottled it. Lots of the typical notes are here, doughy and yeasty malt flavours, backed by a general sweetness and mild booziness, rum raisin cake, a deliciously deep and sweet savoury note, maybe dark chocolate covered dried dark fruits? Spices abound, hard to pick them apart, but you can always expect cloves and just a hint of liquorice. It’s really something else \n\nThe taste? It absolutely follows the nose, but the way it does it is what makes this such an experience to drink. Aside from what you get on the aromas, I’ll point out the most notable flavours. Bubbly, creamy, and boozy up front. You get hints of rum soaked, moist raisin cake. Spices hit you soon after and meld seamlessly, cloves nutmeg and liquorice are notable here. Deliciously yeasty and toasty caramel malts can be tasted throughout the sip and become quite notable at the end, augmented by the spices and sweetness, sort of tastes like you just had toasted bread with butter and cinnamon. Some dark cherry notes here and caramelized banana. Likely due to the high abv% mixing with the fruity esters and the caramel malt flavour, but it makes for some unique and tasty flavours. Perhaps just the slightest hint of general hop bitterness throughout. \n\nLong and complex finish, which is mostly dry and fairly sweet. I didn’t pick up much bitterness myself. More lively carbonation than you might expect, but the carbonation is quite fine. Creates a creamy sip on the way down and prickles at your tongue. ABV% is slightly more noticeable than some other high alcohol beers, but it’s still masked well and the way you feel it with the flavours/it adds to your taste perception is a plus, honestly. \n\nPhenomenal beer, honestly. Mine was a few months old, would love to try an aged one. I think it helped bring the effervescence down slightly judging by how carbonated some other reviewers said theirs were. I only have one more in my cellar, and this is a beer I would love to try at all life stages. Super fresh, a few months old, year or two old, and a super old cellared grandpa! Or maybe it’s just indicative that I want to drink a lot of this. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves any Belgian, or European beers. Or honestly, anyone who likes beers at all. It’s a must try!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Received this cellared version in a trade with @Providence - Date code is L11-545 So bottled in 2011? No idea, but he said it was old.\nPoured rather darker than expected for an Ale; almost cola brown. The manila colored head lasted a very brief time before retreating just to the circumference of the glass.\nThe aroma was potent! Lots of dark fruit (Think figs and/or prunes) and a surprising amount of spice - almost akin to a Christmas ale - curious as I wasn't expecting that at all.\nThe flavor follows, the malts lead the party but the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg?) want to play too. It may be my imagination but it seems they didn't want to get along. Didn't matter to me, I enjoyed it anyway.\nThe feel was better than expected if this is indeed an 11 year old bottle. I would not have guessed that at all; but now I kick myself for not grabbing a fresher one for a side by side.\nReally good beer, but then, that seems to be the consensus.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This one is prototypical of the style for me, a classic for good reason. I've had it many times, but not recently, and never reviewed til now. \nBottled 2021, date/batch code L21-561.\nStrong aromas and flavors of deep caramel, spiced figs, cherries and roast malts. Lively carbonation and bright yeast esters, good sweetness at the front with a dry finish.\nOutstanding beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a little too much flavor for me. I can’t drink ad much as I can Chimay Red.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pour is a light cola colored, but once in the glass it's a much deeper, darker brown. While the pour was fairly aggressive, there was more head than I anticipated, although it only last a couple minutes before receding to a thin spotty cap. Aroma is loads of rich malts, caramel &amp; figs. Taste more or less follows the nose, with some bready notes joining the party. Well balanced, deceptively complex, and super easy drinking in a way that belies its ABV. Very good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look...blackish with a dark brown overtone. off whitish beige head with ample carbonation\nSmell...light hint of citrus and hops. Soft smell of malt\nTaste...Sweet malt with dark fruit , taste of sugar. banana and yeast. \nFeel...Definitely a lightness not expected and light lacing presence on the beer. \nOverall...a decent beer just not my cup of tea. Don't get the excitement of this style so my score definitely reflects that. i am glad it was a gift because the price on these suckers are exorbitant.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into snifter. Beige that dissipates, less retention than many fizzy Belgians. Mid brown color.\n\nMalty chocolate fig nose. \n\nTaste follows with more dark fruits, toffee, the classics. \n\nFeel is where the carb is, on the slightly finish. \n\nDelicious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Dark brown, cloudy; reddish when held up to light. Light head.\nS: Bready and malty, with tons of raisin and prune.\nT: Big malt backbone, touched with stonefruit and raisins, with a little bit of spice.\nF: Carbonation zip pairs with the spice in the beer. The malt and a little bitterness settles on the tongue.\nO: A must-have.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep, dark brown coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells of bready, caramel, slightly roasted malt dark fruit, with rich notes of raisin, plum and fig, as well as some chocolate, spice and hints of licorice. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel, slightly roasted malt, chocolate and rich dark fruit, with notes of raisin, plum and fig, as well as distinct spice, with notes of clove, nutmeg, anise, licorice and just a hint of candi sugar and earthy, bitter hops. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness and some dark fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.\n\nThis makes for a superb, rich and complex Belgian Strong Ale with an excellent balance of sweet and just slightly roasted and bitter notes, as well as a great body and mouthfeel. The focus is clearly on the malts and esters here, with a rich bready and caramel presence and distinct notes of dark fruit and spice, while subtle hops add just a touch of earthy, bitter notes to this that balances it out very nicely. Overall this makes for an incredibly enjoyable example of the style that's quite rich without feeling cloying or overly boozy at all, hiding its ABV very well,",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Chimay Bleue is my favorite of the Chimay range. This is one of those beers you simply cannot turn down if offered to you.\n\nNose: Chocolate, cocoa, Christmas spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, minor citrus notes. Strong yet semi sweet malt aroma.\n\nIn the Glass: Like Red, this is a very dark full bodied ale, the color shows this strong character and it is a beautiful sight. Slight oily legs on the glass much like other full bodied ales.\n\nOn the Palate: You are met with a sweet malt flavor accompanied by cocoa, Christmas spices. Toffee and candied malted barley make up the body of this ale. This is easily the most complex and well balanced Dark Ale I have ever had.\n\nFinish: Sweetness fades into a rounded malt with minor bitterness. \n\nWhile this is most certainly a winter beer due to the spice character, I would enjoy this ale any chance I have. I highly recommend Chimay Blue to anyone who likes beer, no matter how experienced they are.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a mostly opaque muddy brown with an off white super creamy head which lasts a while. Hints of cinnamon,ethyl,stone fruit,cocoa. Taste is very chocolate forward with caramel,and cherries. Feel is luxurious and smooth,creamy,enveloping is a better word than full bodied. Feels like drinking a thin chocolate covered cherry. Overall this is an outstanding ale. Those Trappist monks really know how to brew-",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Close to perfection, Chimary Blueue was one of the first &quot;world class&quot; beers I've ever tried, and it was worth the hype. It offers a dark, deep brown colour, depth is key here as smells of sugary fruit, caramel and cinnamon give away the wonderful, complex and sweet taste with a good amount of carbonation. The alcohol content is nigh impercetible, leaving only a great warm sensation in your stomach.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smooth-drinking combination of sweet malt, lightly bitter Belgian yeast, and toffee. Finishes a bit estery, but a true classic that is still drinking great. Can’t believe I’ve never logged this into BA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Nice crisp label, very dark on the pour, White and black head with the body. Looks classy\nS: not so predominant on this batch, Figs with a meady earthy undertone\nT: Bright and less sweet than I thought. Bit of a rough edged bitter aftertaste\nF: lots of tiny bubbles, I expected a more syrupy mouth feel but it is nice as it is.\nO: I'll be honest , it has a lot of what I like, but the effervescence of bubbliness isn't something I was expecting. \nWould certainly go back for more taste tests.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 75cl bottle.\nL: Very dark brown (almost black) with two fingers of foaming beige head.\nS: Brown sugar, figgy pudding.\nT: Plum, raisin, molasses, cinnamon, brown bread. All perfectly balanced. Moderately sweet.\nF: Medium body, soft mouthfeel, foaming carbonation, dry finish.\nO: A delicate (for 9%) Belgian strong ale. Not overly boozy with a lovely balance. Dangerously drinkable."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’ve heard so much hype surrounding Founders that I decided I’d finally give them a try, I would have sooner if it weren’t for the price. The Dirty Bastard seemed the most likely to be up my alley. After arriving home to pour into a glass and take my first sip, I immediately realize what I’ve been missing. This beer hit me on the first sip with such rich and delightful flavor, something that you kind of take for granted in beer when you’re not used to it.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Might be my favorite beer. I get excited for it every year. Smells of wheat with a slightly sweet malt. Pours an amber color and makes a nice firm head. Has a good solid full bodied, malty, and bready taste. Simple yet strong and hearty. It just screams falls. The weather is cooler, the colors of fall are in full swing. It just screams fall to me which is my favorite time of year. It might not be the most complex flavor but being a Märzen it's not supposed to be. It's simple yet sturdy. Makes me think of light rain on freshly fallen leaves. Put on your jacket sit out on the deck, or porch if you have one and enjoy this beer on a rainy fall day. Just makes me feel at peace when I do.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The worst Oktoberfest beer I've had. Smells tolerable... looks fine, but the taste and texture is repulsive. Utterly flat, flavorless, and this weird, artificial viscosity to it that seems artificial. Imagine the people at Sam Adams going &quot;Let's mass produce an Oktoberfest beer with just malt liquor, caramel color, and thickener&quot;. A strange, sour aftertaste that is reminiscent of rotten tomatoes/pennies. Repulsive. This explains why a 12 pack was on sale for 10 bucks. This is not a good beer. Avoid like the plague.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle\n\nPours over a finger of creamy off-white head into my Boston Lager glass. Retention is wonderful so far, after a few minutes I’ve barely lost any head. Initial lacing looks very nice. Body is a deep orange, nearly brown. Looks great so far.\n\nNose is deep malts, fresh baked bread, slightly earthy. While I often get a caramel aroma from Oktoberfest’s, something I absolutely don’t mind, apparently it’s “inappropriate” for the style. That said, there is none here, so I guess good ol’ Sam has the most accurate depiction of this beer. The aroma is just super straight forward, clean, and very nice.\n\nFlavor is definitely malty, bready, but not quite as clean. There is something just a tad off too, it almost tastes like tomatoes, which apparently can be a DMS issue. Perhaps a creamed corn flavor too if you look for it. Not bad, certainly rough around the edges though.\n\nCarbonation is about medium. Body is medium-light. A nice small touch of sweetness. Bitterness is low. Mouthfeel is solid, and to style.\n\nDrinkability is nice enough, it tastes decent and it’s pretty balanced.\n\nAppearance turned our great. The head eventually died down, but the lacing was thick down the glass.\n\nThe flavor cleaned up a little bit as the beer warmed, those bready flavors replaced the odd ones, but it still wasn’t perfect by any means. Not bad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours with a nice head, but it does not linger. Amber clear in color. It has good flavor, but I expect more malt from an octoberfest. This is drinkable, but fairly mute overall.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Toasty and sweet with a slight hint of hazelnut... doesn't do much to stand out from the sea of similar oktoberfest biers. Very drinkable and forgettable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Has Sam Adams changed the formula? This year's Octoberfest does not meet expectations. 12 oz. bottle poured into tumbler. Little head and no lacing. Taste was flat. Disappointed in this beer that I used to enjoy over the years.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep amber, clear, with sparse tiny bubbles rising to a tall, thick, off-white head with excellent retention. Not much lacing.\n\nThe aroma is not too strong, but it is quite good. Bready, toasty, with some caramel.\n\nThe taste is very malty with lots of bread and caramel. The caramel is more obvious than in the aroma. The flavor carries through to the finish, with just a very slight bittering detected. The aftertaste is, as the initial taste, bready malts with caramel. On the sweet-dry scale, the finish is sweet, but not cloyingly so. The sweetness is well controlled. The overall flavor is pleasant and enjoyable, but relatively straightforward without complexity at all.\n\nThe mouth feel is thin, while also being coating.\n\nOverall, I can see why this beer is popular with the public, while also not being a favorite of the beer enthusiast. I am enjoying it, but it wouldn't be a repeat purchase. (I like the Adams Festbier much better. That one I might buy again, if available separately.)",

Smell is mostly grain, and a little earthy.\n\nTaste is grain/toffee/nuts, definite earthiness, and maybe a burnt toffee bitterness.\n\nMouthfeel is smooth and clean. Overall, it's not terribly exciting, but it's a solid and worthy beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I haven't had a Sam Adams for ages, and then I think there was a choice of one (possibly two). This poured a transparent copper and developed a one-finger toasted cream head that evaporated quickly. The scent after popping the cap was... well.. generic beer like any macro-brew would give off. Once in the glass, though, I picked up whiffs of vanilla, clove, and nutmeg and a ripe fruit... dare I say pumpkin (certainly seemed more that way then the pumpkin beers I've tried recently). As quickly as the head dissipated, I was surprised to feel some effervescence when it first hit the tongue. A nearly cloying sweetness (like ripe fruit) followed and dominated the flavor initially but settled down to leave a slight bitterness at the end. In some ways it is reminiscent of a hard apple cider.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is one of favorite Octoberfests. There are others I like more, but this one never disappoints, is easy to find, good from a bottle, better from a tap. It is a tasty, reliable beer when the cool weather hits.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Excellent. One of my favorites.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Easy to find this time of year. Looks fine. Smells okay. Kinda sweet, but decent taste. Its a beer you wouldn't bitch about if it was the best thing on a menu at a casual dining restaurant. Most usually have Guinness, which I'd take over this, but its a solid beer at the price point.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev First off, it is a very appealing pour to me at least. Burnt orange almost amber color with an off white head that dissipates in moments to a ring. No lacing to speak of. The head is soft and frothy almost like coffee foam.\nThe aroma is hard to describe. Reading some reviews allowed me to kind of put a finger on what I was getting here. It definitely is a baking soda like smell with some toasted bread and caramel undertones. Honey and citrus rind round out the bill.\nTaste is honey up front, lingering caramel throughout. Some biscuit or toast undertones, no hop bitterness or floral notes that I can detect. \nFeel is soft, velvety, and very full. I was impressed with the body as well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks great nice dark color and clear. That's where the pros end. Has a musty smell of old pennies or something. Tastes the same way with this humongous soda like sweetness on top of it. Very thick and not appealing for more. Hacker pschorr and founders much better 2021 options of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Is this a malt/sugar/caramel bomb? Damn right it is! Is this anywhere close to a German okto? No way! That said, in a world where craft brewers pump out $10-15 pack of thin and one-dimensional &quot;our version of marzens&quot; it remains a safe buy. Not a the best buy, that would be imports, but safe.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from bottle into a plastic cup at an outdoor event. It pours a translucent orange-amber with a thin, light khaki head and modest lacing. The nose is subdued but offers notes of caramel and toasted white bread. The taste i on the sweet side with mostly caramel and sweet, bready malt. There is little in the way of nuts, spice or bitterness. Its mouth feel is lite and fairly crisp with a proper level of carbonation and the 5.3% ABV is appropriate. Overall, Sam Adams O-fest is rather one-dimensional. It's rather sweet and lacks the depth or complexity of flavor offered by the better examples of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer is an embarrassment to the Oktoberfest industry. This should not be allowed to be brewed in America. It does not taste anything like Oktoberfest biers. Reinheitsgebot was made to make sure BS beer like this would not be allowed to be brewed in Bavaria. Anyone who scored this high and enjoyed this should stick to juice boxes and fruit snacks.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear amber body with a dirty beige head that crashes in on itself before too long. Piney scent combines the alcohol and hops in a spicy to near astringent aroma. Toasty malt base gives a hint of sweetness along with some pith before spicy hops start to wash over the malt. Pine follows right on the heels and dries the medium light-bodied drink.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 6-week-old can, so reasonably fresh. Pours a deep, clear copper. Off-white foam. Smells like pine and taste like grapefruit pith. Big bitterness, slightly offset with some sweet malt. A big West Coast IPA, as advertised. Delicious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A traditional dry-feeling California IPA, where the bitterness outpaces the citrus flavors. Fairly malty as well. It is very well balanced and has prominent pine notes. Unique and excellent.",

This thing has been aged in the mini-fridge for 5+ years (!) and now is the time to crack this sucker (review from notes) \n\n5 years and it still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam. It was meant to age, this is telling me. Smells like coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops. Prominent alcohol flavor, even at chilled temps and with the age on it. This was a bad boy back in the day, I bet. Tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating\n\nThis is impressive, to be this awesome after 5 years.

Very viscous, creamy mouthfeel was what I noticed first, then a rush of roasted dark malts, dark chocolate and coffee took over. A mild bitterness is mixed in and keeps it from being too sweet.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Classic and iconic Russian Imperial Stout. Pours black with a thin mocha head. The aroma is malt and booze. The taste is dominated by a powerful roasted maltiness with undertones of dark fruit and hops, and a hint of chocolate. Quite aggressive and dry. Savory and not sweet. A bit too much booziness and alcohol warming. Full mouthfeel.\n\nOne drawback is the price. If it were less expensive and more widely available I would have it all the time.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of the benchmark RIS that I can reliably calibrate my palate with or just enjoy on its own merit.\nConsistently good and balanced with the malts dominating and the hops support the depth of flavor. Really good stuff!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 11/6/19 and poured into a tulip. Very dark with a faint redish hue around the edges as it poured. One finger of tan colored head that left behind some nice lacing. Aroma didn't waft out of the glass, but once I get close to get a whiff, it's a really nice maltly smell with distinct chocolate notes. Taste is roasty malts, chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied, and actually a hair thinner than I was expecting based on the ABV. Good beer.",

Burnt bitter finish. \nF: perfect to style. \nOverall: unsurprisingly a great stout from Founders.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours jet black with a one-inch ruddy brown head, nice lacing left throughout. At first, nose is brownie batter, freshly ground coffee, cinnamon. Taste begins up front rather bitter - dark chocolate, cocoa, chocolate covered coffee beans, with a strongly bitter, warming finish. As it warms, the alcohol gets more pronounced on the finish (obviously), but never becomes overwhelming. The bitterness recedes just a touch as well, with a bit more malty/chocolatey sweetness emerging. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, but there is noticeable carbonation. Really pleased to get a bottle (for whatever reason, I never see this around me).",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf from a beer store in LaCrosse, WI. It poured an opaque dark with tan head that is leaving some lace. The scent had a mix of vanilla, molasses, cocoa and roast. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip with molasses, cocoa and hints of cinnamon flare. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is an excellent beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours black with a 2 inch thick, foamy head. Heavy lacing to the end.\n\nAroma of chocolate, molasses, coffee.\n\nTaste is coffee, molasses, cocoa, oak. A bit astringent.\n\nFull bodied, thick and syrupy. Light carbonation. Dry finish.\n\nAnother winner from Founders.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just a fantastic RIS I love to return to. Dark and malty, chocolate, coffee... it’s all there on the nose and on the tongue. The 75 IBU rating must be a mistake. So smooth but not too sweet.\nWorld class indeed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev *Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz bottle*\n\n*Bottled on: 11/05/19*\n\n*Drank on: 05/15/20*\n\nThe look of this beer is a very dark brown to black. It had an attractive two finger thick dark brown head with great retention. It was very nice, decadent looking, and satisfying to look at. No complaints here!\n\nThe aroma immediately hit me when I removed the bottle cap. Rich and decadent, I found that when nosing the glass the aroma brought a nice balance between milk chocolate and roasted sweet malts. This eventually evolved into mellow notes of caramel with a hint of vanilla.\n\nFor the most part, the taste follows the nose. Upfront, I got a rich taste of milk chocolate which developed into the notes of roasted barley in the middle. There was also a coffee-like bitterness in the end coupled with a a char taste. Even with 75 IBUs, I found that this beer found a harmonious balance between sweet and bitterness.\n\nThe feel of this beer was also phenomenal! It was full bodied, smooth, silky and velvety making this feel like I was drinking liquid chocolate. There was a long lingering bitter aftertaste to it, but I generally didn't mind too much. The alcohol in this was hidden very well making this really dangerously drinkable for its ABV.\n\nYeah, I really enjoyed this beer. Balanced, rich and smooth, I really didn't find a whole lot of things in this beer that would stop me from drinking this every week. It was sweet without being too cloyingly so, bitter without feeling like I was coating my mouth with cigarette ashes, and rich without feeling too heavy."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 3 months ago on 10/19/21\nPoured into a shaker, small head that thinned out quickly. Minimal lacing, glass might not have been beer-clean. As seen in at least one other review, honey-colored is the best color descriptor. Rising effervescence.\nSmell is malt, floral and apple\nTaste is semi-malty with slight grapefruit bite\nFeel is okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing off-putting. Bitterness balances the taste and feel.\n\nHard to rate this one. I wish the &quot;Overall&quot; rating carried more weight here. Each individual attribute is better than mediocre, but the sum of its parts is much better than one might think if considering each aspect individually. It's a good, solid, well-rounded tasty beer. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, but if I was at the store and on the fence about what to buy and saw it, I'd remember, &quot;Hey, that was a good one&quot;",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured a cloudy golden color with a thin white head and moderate lacing.\n\nTastes of sweet malt, a little caramel but overall very light.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Haven’t had this one in like a decade. Floral notes, caramel and bready malt. Light grapefruit and lemon. Fairly sweet but nice mild dry floral bitterness on the finish. Solid balance and drinkability.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Everyone keeps saying that this is heavy on the malt. I was expecting a nice malty flavor but was greeted with something a little more akin to an IPA due to the heavy addition of bitter hops. Beautiful honey color and a sweet smell on the pour. I am not an IPA fan, so this wasn’t for me- however, I liked this better than other hoppy beers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very good ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a beautiful murky caramel. A few fingers of tan bubbly, foam rises and recedes to an off white ring leaving soapy lacing. Nose is green apple, honey, and sweet malt. Taste is honey, oak, roasted malt, biscuit, grass, and lemon. All melding together perfectly to create a truly delightful masterpiece. Feel is silky smooth and very full. Love this and will buy more.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is an interesting Octoberfest type beer. Smell is of spices and orange peel. Has a full bodied feel. Taste is a bit all over the place. I don't know if this beer wants to be a marzen or a pale ale. You get a bit of honey along with a nice Bock hop taste. Some citrus with coriander. Interesting beer and can't say I've had one quite like this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark amber small white head, not much retention. Way to dark for the style. \nSmells of caramel, brown bread, for the most part it smells good. \nTastes initially sweet but a huge hit of bittering hops hits you straight away. The hops completely drown out the malts. A Maibock should be malt forward with the hops way in the background. I can’t say this is a bad beer it’s just not anything like a maibock.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12 oz can dated 6/18/21 -- exactly 3 months ago. Purchased at MV Wine &amp; Spirits, Martha's Vineyard.\nPoured into an ordinary tumbler. \n\nI normally only drink IPAs but decided to give this a shot since this store has increasingly tended to stop stocking my favorite IPAs, which also happen to be inexpensive (Jai Alai, Zombie Dust, Racer 5, etc), and replaced them with beers that go for $21 for a 4-pack. This Dead Guy Ale was something like $12.50 for a sixpack.\n\nDark amber color, very little head. Smells malty. Actually to this IPA drinker, it smells very, very malty. And sweet. Not much lacing, although I admit that I've never understood why that matters &amp; never pay attention to it. (Full disclosure: the tumbler I'm drinking it from is made of plastic. The horror! The horror!)\n\nThe taste is, at first, very malty, like a porter or a stout. But it then yields some complexity, with some of the typical hoppy flavors (grapefruit, pine, etc) asserting themselves. There is a definite temporal aspect. The taste changes over a second or two, as it does in all beers worth drinking. \n\nThe mouthfeel is towards the thick, stout side, but it's not as viscous those porters that make you feel like you're drinking a malted milk shake. It's quite pleasant. It's pretty much what I consider perfect texture for a beer, something missing in many IPAs — even the good ones. Carbonation is also at the goldilocks point; not too bubbly, not too flat.\n\nOverall I'd say it's very good. I'm enjoying it. But I don't expect it to buy it again anytime soon because I'm really not a big fan of malty beers. If you like porters &amp; stouts &amp; maibocks, you should read reviews of Dead Guy Ale written by people who like those kinds of beers. They're sure to be more helpful than this one.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Has a dark brown/amberish color with more than a finger's worth of creamy head. Good retention and lacing.\n\nAroma: caramel, toffee, brown/burnt sugar, toasted malts and nuts, vanilla, apples, yeast, and brown bread.\n\nTastes almost kinda sweet, while also being bready and nutty too more so.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: First the can. It's difficult to make him look good on a cooler display. I noticed that the brewery was founded in 1988. It's caramel brown on the pour and moderately active. The bubbles are small and prickly and it's filmy/glossy too.\n\nS: Caramel malty notes with a light brushing of hops.\n\nT: It's almost sweet but pulled back from the brink with a mild IBU rating. (25? 30?). I'm relieved by the lack of nuttiness. Again, it's very malty. There are 5 grains to 1 hop. \n\nF: Heavy, but it has to be to contain all this goodness. It's smooth on the palate, and I wouldn't guess that it was 6.8%. \n\nO: Given the age of the brewery and the ubiquitous-ness of the Rogue™ brand, tracking down the Dead Guy is an easy task. Ask a beer to stock it for you, prepay for your case even. You might not find him on the shelves, but trust me, he is at a warehouse nearby.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a very pretty translucent copper with a very small tan head. It smells like toasty malts with a decent amount of banana yeast smell to it. The taste is pleasantly malty without being too heavy, too sweet or too bitter. This one goes down like a dream. Overall an exceptional beer and a great example of a maibock.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a beautiful clear, dark orange to amber color with a strong head. Not pale at all surprisingly. (4.00)\n\nAroma: : Strong and malty aromas of rich caramel, toffee, sweet brown brea, brown sugar, syrup, and rich brown malts. Some definite and rich floral and hints of amber citrus notes. Maybe some vanilla cream. underneath. (4.25)\n\nFlavor: The flavors follows with strong an deep brown bread flavors of caramel, toffeee, brown sugar, syrup , and rich and sweet brown bread malts. There's pasry, strudel with a sweet nutty pecan and walnut flavor. Somewhat of a floral and amber citrus note as well. There is a mild hop flavor of amber citrus and maybe apricot? Sweet, yet an appropriately dry, smooth and balanced finish. Hides the alcohol well.\n\nMouthfeel: A full bodied mouthfeel. Not oily, but heavy enough and with respectable carbonation. Leans sweet, but smooth and drinkable\n\nCompared to Schells' Bock 5/29/21: Pours a lighter and more orange color. Stronger aromas/flavors. More caramel, toffee, sweet bread, amber citrus, and apricot. Less brown bread crumbs, toast, and syrup flavor. Winner: Dead Guy\n\nOverall: This is a delicious beer one of the few I've had from the Maibock style It has an intense and rich caramel flavor. Nice toffee, nuts, and floral and hoppy amber citrus &amp; apricot flavor to support. Less toasted or roasted flavors like other German beers, as expected of the Maibock style. Has a decent body and a background sweetness that is not too overbearing. Quite a well balanced brew and incredibly drinkable for a malty beer. (Final Rating: 4.34)"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 22oz bomber.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev DATE: July 10, 2021... OCCASION: settling in for a comfortable evening after a long, enjoyable lake trip--why not unwind with a classic?... GLASSWARE : Maudite snifter... this pours a beautiful, glowing orange amber body alive with effervescence... its two-finger head is white and staunch, settling to a lacy ring... robust resin and pine, pineapple, lime and mango... hard fruits mix with thick malts to produce an aromatic balance to the hops--an aggressive yet controlled offering... a bit boozy too, but not at all intrusive or off-putting... active, lively at its introduction, strong in its presence and lasting in its finish... its citrus and resin shine here, bright and thick, puckerish and chewy... the grapefruit especially resounds in each sip, thick and appreciable... big, bold fruits make this worth returning to, a classic that is accessible, both in stores and in profile...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a bottle at the Sixteen Mile House in Millbrae. Pours a cloudy amber. They claim to have launched the hops competition, and I believe it. Piney and grapefruit. The hops lingers, so I take a while between sips.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Two words can describe this IPA - juicy and hoppy...\n\nThis was a huge hop-punch to my mouth - very juicy, and enough booze to pull it all together in a nice looking beer. I was also impressed with the full-bodied mouthfeel. \n\nOn the bottle it claims it helped start the on-going hop craze. After having this, I have to agree...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reviewed from 22 oz. bomber. No visible date on bottle. This is one I used to drink a lot in the early days of exploring craft beer. It's a local staple at bars in the bay area. I always remember it being a brightly flavored IPA. Let's dive into this glass. Beautiful amber color with a rich creamy head. Beautiful lacing all over the glass. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of pine, orange marmalade, lemon zest and candied malts. I have a feeling this isn't the freshest it could be but it seems approachable enough. The malts give off a slight bready smell. Good taste. Bright fruit flavors and a decent amount of bitterness backed up by a strong malt foundation. Slightly refreshing and the alcohol isn't discernible at 7.5%. This beer can be dangerous if you put too many back without thinking because it's that drinkable. I go back for a second chug and it is just as refreshing as the first. A very well balanced moderately hopped example of a west coast IPA. In a time before double IPA's and triple IPA's this was the go to strong ale along with Mendocino brewery's Eye of the Hawk.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look...amber light brown and clear with medium carbonation\nSmell...the faint smell of hos ,citrus dank\nTaste...sweet malt front end bittererer (haha) back end . A great combination of earthiness and dry and citrus. Resin like stickiness. Interesting \nFeel...thin not juice like. Appropriate carbonation leaving a bit of lacing. prickly mouthfeel .Excellent\nOverall...this is very good and would buy anytime wanting a very well made earthy IPA. Nice to know that this is around and will continue to try their beers. They have 3 or 4 variants around here and will try them all because the pricing is realistic.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a beer I have enjoyed for many years and was surprised to realize I had yet to review it. While irrelevant to the review, I love the label art. \n\nA big, two-inch head glistens with dark, chestnut hues. A pancake batter forms over the opaque blackness within a Harp nonic. The batter ever so slowly retreats, leaving dense patches of lace in its wake. The head never fully dissipates, rather, it forms a quarter inch of dense cream to be penetrated with each sip.\n\nDark roasted Bakers chocolate yields to rich, roasted coffee beans. Later, malted chocolate mixes with caramel and light hints of floral and mint notes from the hops.\n\nThe flavor follows the nose, while the roasted nuances are subdued. Bitterness edges out sweetness and both are well controlled. The hops are more like pine straw than the floral or mint observed in the aroma. This could be a savory dessert with its light umami dancing in the long, mild finish.\n\nThe light to medium body is low for the style. A smooth, fluffy texture envisions dense fur. Soft carbonation lifts the light dryness, while residual sugar builds on the lips.\n\nThis goes well with a cigar, however, it is so good on its own, that one should reserve most of it for the pure drinking experience. It elevates a ribeye. Today, I enjoyed it while reading as my wife played the harp, on a cold, wet, November, Sunday afternoon.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep, dark mocha-brown, giving it a brown-black hue rather than ruby. A thin, half finger tan head appears and quickly recedes.\n\nGorgeous aromas here, there are three stars: chocolate and rich cocoa, roasted and toasty caramel malts, and smoky coffee beans. \n\nTaste follows the nose to a T. The chocolate is smoother here, more sweet with toffee and caramelized sugar notes than cocoa. The smoky notes are tones down, and the roasted malty, toasted bread flavours are a little more subtle. Some lighter coffee bean tastes, but it’s in the background and well integrated, which is nice and gives this a balanced flavour profile. No major appearance of hop flavours aside from a very light bitterness on the finish. The bitterness feels like it comes from the roasted malts rather than typical hoppy notes, which is enjoyable in a Porter/stout.\n\nSemi-dry finish, with a medium body that leans to the lighter side. Lower carbonation, which results in a very smooth sip, the very very gentle bubbles roll over the tongue and lightly froth at the end creating a creamy sensation. Gentle finish, lightly bitter with nice malty and chocolate notes. \n\nAfter a lot of (sadly local) poor stouts and porters, when I cracked this open and poured it and got a whiff of delicious aromas just from opening it, I got very excited! That being said, I will temper that a bit by saying I don’t think I can rate this as high as it is on BA. I definitely enjoy stouts and porters with huge, bold flavours. That said, Founders Porter doesn’t necessarily need to be powerful, holding its own by dialing up a few key flavours and melding then together in complex and subtle ways.\n\nThe line between porters and stouts is very blurry, and between a ‘robust’ porter and stout (or imperial stout), well, it gets quite confusing. Some would say (and they have!) that these porters are meant to be more subtle and complex than stouts. Since the line is so blurred I just try to take it on my personal tastes. Regardless of all of that, this is still an excellent beer. My next aim is to try this on tap (unlikely for now as I live in Canada) and trying to get a super fresh bottle. Mine was four months out of bottling so some of the flavours might have mellowed",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Dark black pour with very little foam risen to the surface. \nSmell: Reminds me of a stout kind of chocolate with high malts. On the bottle it says there's a caramel smell to it - didn't catch that in my pour.\nTaste: Immediate taste of malts, chocolate, slight caramel taste as well towards the end with a bitter finish. Well done! This is a really good porter - probably the best I've tried so far. (I've only tried 6 porters - more of a stout guy).\nFeel: Medium to full bodied - light carbonation.\nOverall: The reason I bought this beer was because I've heard about it before, and in some way it reminded me of a stout. This beer is a very good beer, definitely would buy again in the future.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good-looking Porter.\n\nSmell: Fairly moderate roasted malts and mild brown sugar notes.\n\nTaste: The taste profile features subdued roasted malt note, some dark chocolate notes, and mild coffee notes, with some bitter hop notes at the end. The finish is fairly dry ending on the roast malt notes and bittering hop notes.\n\nMouth-feel: on the light side of medium bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation. \n\nOverall: A good non bal-aged porter. The flavor profile nicely integrates all the different elements present.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bought a case of this about mid-2021, tasted like the label described, smooth, etc. Bought another case the other day, bottled December 2021, tastes like a campfire. Never liked that in a stout, let alone a Porter, and certainly wouldn't have repurchased if the previous batch tasted like it. Anyone want 23 bottles of burnt Porter?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a nice contrast to all the coffee-centric stout porters on the market. I want to think that this is a larger fermented porter based on it's character. Either way, larger or ale, the mouth feel is crispy, tingled froth. Nose is edge of smokey roasted, with a base of yeastyness. Appearance is strong, and fades to respectable porter carbonation. Flavor is burnt ends, charred wood, and hop balance. Dark chocolate akaline finish. Overall, a powerful player in the porter game to put balance in the force.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.\nPoured from a twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass.\nLooks dark brown almost black with a nice tannish foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap.\nSmells malty, sweet, chocolate and coffee.\nTaste follows the nose nicely, lots of chocolate coffee and caramel.\nMouth feel is medium for the style with a nice creamy finish.\nOverall a very nice example of a Porter that I would definitely order again.\nCheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Mmm, pours dark and lovely. Big chocolate notes. Subtle coffee, bit more bitter than I expected. What a lovely porter.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle to pint glass. Bottled 12/1/21.\n\nL: Deep dark brown (not quite black); coffee-colored. Light brown head that fades slowly.\nS: Chocolate, just a little bit boozy. Caramel sweetness too.\nT: Lots more chocolate, a little coffee flavor mixed in. A little bitterness but not as much as expected from other reviews.\nF: Smooth but heavy enough for a porter.\nO: A great example of the style, though not as on the mark as Edmund Fitzgerald.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle dated 10-20-2021 into a 12oz Tulip glass\n\nThis is my first ever review. Here goes. Simply outstanding. \n\nL: Black , opaque . Can’t see through the liquid black gold. Using a flashlight on my phone from the other side no light passes through. A nice fluffy tan , creamy-looking head that dissipates after a couple minutes into a nice thick ring that leaves silky lacing on the glass as it goes.\n\nS: plenty of toasty coffee , and chocolate on the nose, some type of dark fruit maybe ? Malty. And caramel .\n\nT: Non sweet chocolate and malt up front , and tons of toasted coffee and hops on the finish that blend perfectly . Not too bitter, but sweet actually. Roasted coffee beans linger on the finish, and the aftertaste. Simply fantastic.\n\nF: Mildly carbonated , between medium to full-bodied on the mouthfeel. Mild carbonation on the finish that bodes well with the aftertaste . Not as silky as some stouts. Not as full bodied as some stouts. This is a porter. A fantastic example of a Porter. \n\nOverall I give this beer a 4.75 , give or take. Fantastic example of the style . One of the , if not the absolute best Porter I’ve ever had .",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a good Porter. In fact, though I don’t drink porter much, this is the top of the list. It is thick, flavorful, and smooth. It is nutty, chocolate, and coffee infused. Very tasteful and hardly any aftertaste. Thumbs up!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 Oz bottle. Package date 10/06/21\nPoured into a pint glass\n\nPours a solid black body with a fluffy tan head. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles noted. Decent retention. Multiple rings of lacing.\n\nSmell is malt forward. Cocoa with a little coffee and a few raisin notes. \n\nTaste is semisweet chocolates with a slight hop bite on the finish. Nice balance!\n\nSilky smooth feel is simply outstanding.\n\nSo glad I tried this porter! Loved the balance and the feel. This one is going into the regular rotation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle from a six-pack purchased at the LCBO; dated Jul 15 2021 and served barely chilled.\n\nPours an inky, opaque brownish-black colour with crimson red highlights, topped with one finger of soapy, foamy, dark beige-coloured head. It dissipates within three minutes or so, reduced to a frothy collar of suds underneath an arcing swath of sticky lace. The aroma is potent - or perhaps 'robust' is a more appropriate descriptor here - with a nice mix of rich malt and understated hop contributions. I'm getting plenty of roasted malts, with dark chocolate, espresso and herbal, earthy hops; hints of char, licorice, maybe a touch of alcohol and devil's food cake.\n\nA stellar robust porter that delights the taste buds from start to finish. Roasted malts at the forefront, imparting big dark roast coffee and espresso flavours; these are followed up by sweeter notes of fudge and dark chocolate. Earthy, herbal, woodsy hops at the finish, with a touch of licorice and coffee/roastiness in the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with low carbonation that gently brushes against the surface of the palate; feels smooth, soft, and satisfying to sip. This 12 oz serving was gone before I knew it, and thank goodness there's five more.\n\nFinal Grade: 4.26, an A-. Founders Porter is a must-try in the sense that it's an archetypical example of its style - it provides a template, a frame of reference for what to expect when sampling or reviewing robust porters in the future - I believe the term &quot;gold standard&quot; may be appropriate here. There's no additional ingredients or flavourings here - nothing but plain ol' porter, but damn is it a good one. Something I'd probably buy regularly if it were sold in Ontario year-round, but for now I'll have to keep my fingers crossed and hope for another shipment in the new year.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a very dark, thick body that light doesn't penetrate, with aa full creamy tan head that lasts longer than most I can remember. The aromas of darkly roasted malts are thick, with dark coffee, dark cocoa and rich caramel notes, along with leathery woody note. Epic rich malty taste follows this parade exactly with a feel that is a bit too thick for porter . Perfectly balanced, from front to back, and presents itself more like a stout than a porter.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pitch black body, with a dense, thick layer of espresso-crema head, several minutes of good retention, which forms back up with a few swirls.\nDark cocoa, like fudge cake, coffee, and a background of blackberries and dark cherries.\nTaste is much more dark, bitter coffee, with cocoa showing up towards the finish; rich and palate-coating, the flavour lingers for days, the bitterness mellowing out to let the malty notes gain some balance; dry finish, clean and crisp; very light fruitiness, of dark berries, like you might find in some coffee beans, and a dash of dark caramel; medium carbonation and body; you wouldn't call this creamy, though it does have some smoothness to it, it's more of a crisp (not too much so!), clean feel.\n\nThis is a delight for it's focus, craftsmanship, and subtle complexity.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Single bottle from Party Town",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reliable. Consider my words &quot;novice&quot;. Been enjoying random brews and &quot;stays with for awhile&quot; and Founders Porter is one such.\nWhen the cool season comes on it just Feels right.\nDays of ice beer long gone with passing youth and nearing 40. But at 56 yrs young, Founders Porter feels like something Burt Lancaster might swig as much as Sid Caesar",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a glass bottle produced 9/23/21. Black color with a finger of foamy brown head. Roasted malt smell. Medium body. Rich malty flavors with some chocolate notes and a bitter finish. Man, this is delicious",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured a 355ml bottle into a pint glass. A thin brown head soon diminished to a thin layer. Good head retention and minor lacing.\nCoffee in the nose.\nSweet coffee and chocolate up front. Bitter sweet. A mild hop finish.\nSurprisingly light body. Moderate carbonation.\nAn interesting porter overall.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;A squat brown twelve ounce bottle has had its contents poured into a clear pint glass. A lovely pour it is. The color inside the glass is that typical black coffee brown of most stouts/porters. The appropriate head is tan and leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Interestingly, there's no pronounced aroma other than a little maltiness. How this much taste is hidden from the nose is amazing. There's plenty of robust roasted malt here, that it's noteworthy. In fact, this is a roasted malt bomb. It's more complex, as there is some hopping character, although not bittering. The mouthfeel is smooth, but a little too light for the style. This is an above average American porter, but definitely not among the best."

Some sweet potato and pumpkin with a slight pumpkin spice like a pumpkin candle on the finish. \n\nFlavor: Strong bready flavors upfront. There's a pumpkin and sweet orange flavor in the middle, that turns into the pumpkin spice flavor. Finishes with a fall/autumn spice, and slightly bitter finish.\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied.

I haven't had too many pumpkin spiced or pumpkin flavored beers, but this one was the best I've had. Sort of feels like an imperial hefeweizen, but instead of banana bread is flavored with pumpkin. The breadiness is there. There's canned pumpkin and orange. Also some pumpkin and fall spice. Well rounded and drinks well. (Final Rating: 3.91)",

Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and everything like a pumpkin spice candle, some apple pie smell, some how it smells like toasted crust too! really amazing.\n\nTaste: It tastes like pumpkin pie spit in beer and yeah kinda disappointing. Good malty beer with some cinnamon and clove flavor, and maybe nutmeg?? very little alcohol taste. The smell was amazing and complex, and the beer itself, at least to me, doesn't really have much &quot;pumpkin&quot; flavor.

Feel is thick and chewy with a nice carbonation bite. In the end there's a bit of dryness that sneaks in. There's a definite alcohol warmth with this. Overall, I don't have a lot of experience with barleywines, but I do like this and would buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I first started drinking Bigfoot exactly 10 years ago, and every year, I buy several 6 packs and drink them periodically throughout the year. Today, I'm drinking the 2022 release on 2/5/22. It is outstanding, as usual. There was a ton of hop residue in the bottom of the bottle already, and I like my Bigfoot on the hoppy side, so I swished the last little bit around in the bottom of the bottle before I finished the pour. Pours a beautiful (and slightly hazy) dark cherry to copper hue with a beige head that falls down to an island with a ring around the rim of the glass. Smell is actually slightly mute this time around, but I can detect a slight caramel sweetness that blends well with a general, but faint, hop presence. The taste is definitely hop-forward, as I did swish the residue out of the bottle into my glass, but for me, that makes it perfectly balanced with its absolutely booming malt character. I believe that several hop varieties are used in the brewing of this beer, and the bitter aftertaste is absolutely there, but the malt flavor is so huge that it's hard to pinpoint any one flavor that stands out; it is amazingly well blended. Bitter-sweet medium-thick mouthfeel that finishes quite dry... the alcohol presence is very well hidden... Overall one of the best Bigfoot releases I've had yet!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Long-time Bigfoot enthusiast. Generally you can expect a somewhat-sweet, quite malty version of an IPA, like an IPA that has had 40% of the water evaporated out of it. Generally, delicious!\n\n2022's is harsher, as KT3418 has mentioned (although &quot;barleywine style&quot; is just a legal term for all barleywines...not an indication that it's not a real barleywine). The usual heat is just not balanced this year by enough syrupy sweetness. Disappointing but it's still one of the more awesome brews on the shelves.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Minimal head on a deep copper body. The aroma doesn't prepare for the taste, which is intense. A wonderfully bitter hop bite on a robust malt base, with a full mouthfeel. This will be great for cellaring!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I poured a 12 oz. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot into a pint glass. A cream colored head emerged above a beautiful red amber body that was impressively carbonated. Profuse lacing rose above a head that receded but never entirely disappeared. I have never been more impressed by a beers' look! The magic faded on the nose, however. Nice raspberry and bread notes were offset by a pungent hops note, which overrode the more pleasant components. The taste was a bit more amenable to enjoyment... the sweetness expected from a barleywine is there, and lingers a bit, but after a minute without a sip, the hops reasserts and again controls your senses. There is a sense of quality to this brew... the taste, look and feel of it are assertive, and if you are a true hophead, you might be enchanted with Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. I prefer to enjoy a barleywine that celerates its' fruited and grain characteristics. This is not that beer. The mouthfeel is quite good, I anguished a bit, that perhaps it deserved a 4.5. Overall, the taste and smell kill it for me, but I like dark, sweet beers. There are simply too many hops in the mix here for me, but I do believe it is a quality brew that will be cherished by hops lovers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The 2022 edition is absolutely awful fresh. Tastes like an extremely malt-forward IPA. None of us could stand this. Hope it's better next time or with age. Did not taste like a barleywine, can't help but notice they just say barleywine style. Maybe I need to wait 10 years before opening one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Opaque amber with orange reflections, the foam is compact and fine ocher in color. Scent of caramel, biscuit, date, citric hops but mainly resinous. Sweet, softly and sweetly malty entry, generously bitter finish on resinous and fresh paths despite two years from bottling. Medium and round body with fine low intensity carbonation. Few elements elegantly linked together. Delight.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beginning in 2005 I've enjoyed each year of this release. It is perfectly rich, sweet and hoppy with deeply caramelized malts, firm and creamy. It has the signature SN central axis of taste that illuminates throughout their beers. Now 2021, I can finally cellar some bottles to enjoy and age for a few years. A beautiful American Barleywine that is world-class in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottles poured into snifters. Side by side tasting of the 2011 and 2014 vintages:\nL - both are caramel colored with nice hazelnut heads that lingered. 2011 may be a shade darker, but really no noticeable difference\nS - same, very slight scent, caramel and bread\nT - caramel, sweet nuttiness. both are very nice, with both malt and hop flavors. 2014 is a bit silkier and more full bodied, 2011 seems to have more hop bitterness\nF - thick mouthfeel, 2011 has a tad more carbonation feel to it\nO - both are very nice, initially I prefer the 2014 vintage, it's a bit smoother and silkier",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A-beautiful dark caramel color with substantive head and lacing that lasted a long time\nS-Moderate roast and hoppy notes\nT-With the heavy hops, this almost seems like a boozy, not as roasty Black IPA. Which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. Above average bitter for the style.\nM-Medium(+) body, a little chewy, pretty dry finish. Moderate carbonation.\nO-unexpected, different, really good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A lot hoppy than I remember. Not terribly sweet, it's almost like a malty IPA. \nI enjoy this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. 2021 Vintage, so quite fresh, not aged. \n\nL---Mostly clear, dark amber color. Frothy, off-white head with excellent retention. Beautiful lacing. \n\nS---Sweet &amp; malty. Caramel, dried fruits. Vague hoppiness.\n\nT---Caramel, toffee, dried fruits. \n\nF---Medium bodied, but I was expecting it to be fuller. Good carbonation, which I didn't expect. \n\nO---I was super excited when I saw this one. I was not disappointed. It's freaking good. Wifey thinks it's freaking good, too.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 19.2 oz can. Pours rich amber with a nice off white head and lots of small bubbles. On the nose you get the hops more than malt. The malt is hidden by the pale ale for the IPA crowd. You get pine and grapefruit in the hops. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. This is a good transition beer. Try it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The iconic Dale's and its ugly ass can....an American classic Pale Ale now, and still a big one to get a good buzz. Not my favorite pale ale, but it is a good one, more like an old school ipa in some ways. Pretty good, but not the best. A good hot dog/ ballgame type of beer. bold malt and hop and stands the test of time",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I had never tried Dale's Pale Ale until I moved to North Carolina only 14 miles from the Brevard brewery. I've seen it before, but the plain label made me think it was a generic pale ale. Boy, was I wrong. It's a 'hoppier' pale ale than I'm used to and, for me, is perfect as an everyday-anytime alternative to the heavier IPAs that I still love.\n\nIt's crisper than an average IPA and lighter.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev So this was the last one of the IPA 16oz i tried from the local beer distributor. Why? Because of the plain label. I thought if they didn't put much time into the label, how good could it be. Well, it is actually better than alot of the others i tried. A little darker than the others, it is clean and crisp with a medium hop taste. Don't be fooled by the label like i was, worth trying.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Probably one of the more recognized names in the pale ale portfolio. Fairly priced and widely distributed so you're bound to run into it sooner or later. Not much to dislike since it is so well balanced, particularly in the taste. while some of those flavors stay distinct and identifiable. Reliable and satisfying.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 9/1. Consumed 11/6\nL: Clear copper, frothy white head\nS: Hoppy with some sweet malt\nT: Hope bite, caramel malt, balanced \nF: Medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel, dry finish \nO: Pretty good beer. I think I’d enjoy this one more with a meal as it seems like it would pair well with a lot.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can.\nL: Beautiful red/amber colour with a light haze and a thin and short-lived head.\nS: Light and sweet.\nT: Huge malt and hop profile - burnt toffee, nutmeg, light citrus and resin. Bone dry.\nF: Medium/full bodied with a slick mouthfeel and an astringent finish.\nO: Old skool AIPA. Rich malt sweetness married to an intense hop burn. Can remember first drinking a can of Dale’s when skiing in CO back in maybe 2010. It looks the same now (same packaging) and I reckon it tastes pretty much the same as well. Good stuff. An American craft ale OG.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My go to sesh beer. Always loved it. Tastes great straight out if the can but I usually pour it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pour is a rich amber like color with a good finger and half of thick bone colored head. Nice bit of lacing on the glass.\n\nSmell is slightly sweet. A bit malt like and some pine. A bit of bitterness coming out on the smell.\n\nThe hops present a bit of pine bitterness followed by some sweet malts on the taste. Just a real nice balance of those two notes.\n\nMouth feel is pretty light with a touch of a slick finish.\n\nThis is a pretty plain and simple pale ale, kind of like what it says it is. The hops do seem to shine a bit more than the malt backbone but not enough to break the balance. The ABV is not present at all even though it is 1.5% higher than a lot of standard American Adjunct Lagers. Really glad I tried this one. I always had a favorite pale ale and that was Mirror Pond by Deschutes. This one seems a bit lighter than that but I have not had it in a while. I really would like to try this with some Mirror Pond and Sierra Nevada's pale ale. That may be interesting. Really give this a go if you like the style. I think Oskar Blues did a pretty darn good job here. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I am a huge fan of their Ten Fidy. This, not so much. Tastes like Dale pissed in a can and added some hops. I can’t for the life of me understand why some people seek this out. The only thing I can figure is that this is the first Pale Ale that a few macro-lager fans ever tried, and they thought to themselves “this has exactly the same low quality aluminum and piss taste I normally drink, but with added hops”. Oh well. De gustibus non est disputandum.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smooth as a Michelob with an interesting taste that is akin to the smell of farm animals in a surprisingly good way",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just an all around easy drinking beer. Perfect after a hike, bike, camp, or fishing day.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Another solid effort from the Oskar Blues folk. I am really liking their mixed 15 can pack (at a great price at Albertsons). Pours a pretty gold with great carbonation and a fantastic lingering cap of froth. Refreshing and balanced on the palate with just the right hoppy bite. This is another solid beer that doesn't try to do too much. No nose to speak of, but so be it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very soapy, fluffy head that’s in no hurry. Reddish gold body, moderate translucence. Simple pine and biscuit sweetness on the nose. Taste is surprisingly malty. Piney hop bitters upfront quickly become roasted, caramel malts in the body with a smokey finish. Feel and finish are wet. \nI get red ale vibes from this more than pale ale, but pretty good nonetheless.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice overall beer and easy to understand the broad appeal. A little fruity with hints of orange and spice. I enjoyed it with a mango/chicken burrito at a local Mexican restaurant and it paired really well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours well with a small head of foam. The head dissipates rather quickly, and leaves very little lacing. The color is a darker orange with a cloudy haze. The aroma is certainly sweet with hints of fruitiness and very little hoppy aroma. The taste compared to the aroma is less sweet, with caramel grainy flavors and hints of citrus. An enjoyable brew, but I find the look and smell promise more than the flavor supplies. The flavor I would typically associate with Belgian style ales is not present with very little phenolic flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’m not fond of Belgian Whites, but I tried to be fair in rating this, comparing it to other Belgian Whites.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The pour was nice and smooth, a very hazy orange color to it. The smell definitely resembles that of an orange. The taste was very smooth, a nice orangey not to strong feel to it. This beer in my opinion should be rated higher than its current ratings. It's a nice refreshing beer that should be enjoyed with friends, family or even after a nice long work day.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not bad not great. Pretty weak flavors to me. Had some orange zest flavors and coriander like advertised. Refreshing but still not a whole lot going on. Orangey color. Kinda cool with the slightly unfiltered look. Better out of a bottle but not bad out of a can. Inoffensive beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a 12oz. bottle gently poured into my Blue Moon 16oz. weizen glass. This ale had a one finger head of white foam that slipped away to a thin cap and no lacing left behind. This is a hazy pale straw colored ale with heavy carbonation.\nThe aroma is a pleasant sweet malt, some yeast, with light wheat notes.\nThe flavor is sweet orange citrus, a touch of malt, and a light hop finish that cuts the sweetness nicely but enhancing the fruit at the same time. The wheat is there but very subtle.\nThis has a very nice smooth creamy feel.\nThis is an easy one to drink, you notice a little more with each sip. With or without the orange, this is a winner!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My first experience with this beer was in a downtown Chicago bar. I asked the bartender to describe this beer I’ve never had. He did and I turned it down for an MGD. Next night the same bar I decided to try it and wow did I like this beer. That was ten years ago and since then it’s been my go to. Mind you I’ve tried many many beers including barrel aged beers and I keep coming back. Oddly it tastes best when I drink a different beer before I drink Blue Moon. It really wakes up my taste buds. Actually I’m not tasting the coriander or orange maybe it’s just me. Love the unfiltered look. Just drop the orange. I feel funny about fruit on the beer glass.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Well umm, where to start here. Blue Moon was one of the first beers I really liked. Then I kinda liked it too much one night and it took a while to even want anything to do with it again. I wanted nothing to do with it whatsoever. I think after five years I can once again say this is a nice beer. It's certainly not Allagash and we have had many whit beers that are very, very good. They all are judged against the moon. To say Blue Moon is a bad beer just cuz its a mass produced Coors product is a cop out and too easy. Blue Moon has its place and I rediscovered that this week while in Florida. An ice cold Moon with an orange slice after a hot round of golf or sitting by the pool is a small piece of heaven. Its light. Its citrusy and freaking delicious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange with white head. Kinda hazy. \nSmells of oranges and coriander and yeast. \nTaste is in the vain of the smell. \nNot a bad beer if there is nothing else decent. Nice break if you are at a ball game and don’t want a lite lager.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Way to wheaty and the notes of orange peal are understated. Not the best Belgian white that you can buy",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drinking out of 22oz pilsner glass at aquarium bar\n\nLook is the classic hazy witbier look with light/ring of head, no lacing, but the haze makes it look almost juicy\n\nSmell is lacking, lots of fermentation notes, not necessarily yeast. Some malt notes, but I cant detect the orange peel its brewed with. \n\nTaste is smooth and malty with light hops and a hint of the coriander bringing some bitterness, drinks very consistently, but fresh squeezed orange definitely brightens it up, not necessarily sweetening it just opening it up and probably covering those macro flavors\n\nFeels like something smooth that's is a step up from and adjunct but certainly not craft, not bad, almost refreshing, and consistently good mouth feel with the carbonation until you swallow.\n\nOverall simple wheat beer that goes well with a meal for a celebration.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The first beer I ever liked. It’s definitely a special style and different from your normal lagers and such. Easy to drink with some different complexities that you don’t find in other macro lagers. It’s not a favorite of mine any longer, but I won’t turn it down if offered. Drink what you like.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a pale honeyed amber with just the slightest haze. A good fingers worth of head diminishes to nothing in rather short order despite some rather active carbonation. Smells nice, though: citrus and spice and everything nice. Taste follows the nose, as it tends to, with a mild malt component as well. It's sweet, but not in any way cloying. It lands on the south side of medium-bodied with a bit too much &quot;crispness&quot; for my liking, but I think it gets the job done as a Summer time crusher. I'm not sure that this qualifies as a legit Belgian wit, but it's perfectly tasty under the right circumstances."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev There was a time the quality of a brew with the Firestone Walker label went unchallenged. Recently, there have been rumors heard that may no longer be true. This investigation begins by pouring two 12 oz. cans into a clear glass liter mug. A pretty pour it is. The color is a bright and nearly translucent copper. Well carbonated, a small enduring head is joined by good glass lacing and noticed. Not pungent, there is a soft aroma of malt and hops around the glass. Wonderfully drinkable, this does everything a great DIPA should. It's malt forward is velvety, slightly sweet, perfectly carbonated and earthy the way only barley can deliver. At the finish, the hops rule the taste. Nicely complex, they are a little fruity and mostly piney at the finish. There is a taste contribution from the alcohol that isn't distracting and belongs within a good American Double IPA. So much for rumors.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Clear and golden-hued, slim, off-white head, long-lasting.\n\nAroma: Dank and pungent. Wide open and fuming with fruity and floral aromatics, crackling with hop bitterness. Citric fruits aplenty, with tropical, as well. Stone fruit, too. Orange and lemon meet mango and apricot. Lovely stuff.\n\nLet's drink! That cornucopia of the aroma is plump on the palate, with hop bitterness hanging in close on the side. Just about perfect. Several ounces in, and the booze rises up. It sits happily in the mouth, and causes no fuss, just the general happy feelings we associate it with. Ah, yes. And, yum, yum.\n\nBeautiful fruit, beautiful booze, beautiful bitterness. Mmm, yes. Soft mouthfeel, brilliant hoppy texture, long finish. How many ways do I love this wonderful beer? How many ways are there?",

Near the finish, pine and citrus are again in the spotlight and closes with a great hop bite along with some sweetness\nMouthfeel: Big, full – almost viscous, a little slick, some alcohol heat, medium-high carbonation, and medium dryness on the finish\nOverall: This is big, bold, and awesome stuff. A total throwback WCDIPA that is huge on pine and citrus along with being a full-feeling beer, has great dryness, and some booze heat that leaves no doubt it’s big.

For a DIPA, this one has superb balance. The stiff ABV is well masked and lies in wait for the unwary; it's very drinkable. Taste is tropical / stone fruit...dates, figs and peaches overlying a solid malt base. F-W has done it again.",

Some heat in the long finish. \nDrinkability is high and the strength is deceiving.\nOutstanding.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: This Beer poured an amber, copper color with a nice frothy egg-shell colored head. Bubbles floated quickly to the top consistently throughout my entire time drinking the 12 oz can.\n\nS: The smells flowing from this beer were very green and pine-y. I detected hints of citrus such as orange in the scent, with a very slight tinge of booze. The smell was extremely appetizing and made me excited to sip it.\n\nT: As far as double IPA’s go, this tasted great. There was a nice initial tinge of orange with a delicious malty and biscuity flavor flowing over the tongue afterwards. It finishes with a long bitterness that plays on the tongue afterwards for several minutes. Personally, I couldn’t taste much of the alcohol if at all.\n\nF: Mouth feel was great. Very full and hardy with decent carbonation that wasn’t so extreme that it harmed the experience. It definitely felt fun and full in the mouth, but not so heavy that it might have creeped into a creamy territory. \n\nO: Overall a delicious double IPA that I would definitely consider buying a pack of. With 9.5 abv it definitely packs a punch, but the flavors are there to back it up. Great showing by Firestone Walker."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear copper leaving a finger of off white head. Aromas of coffee, citrus, and bread. Taste is bold and spicy. Hints of citrus and toffee with a very strong malt backbone. Just a touch of hops and pine. This beer is full bodied and creamy. Nice feel. Overall this a quality offering from Victory. Just a touch too malty for my preference but a solid brew nonetheless",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer first appeared on my beer radar very early in the game. I didn't even drink yet. It was the summer before college, we were at a buddy’s house and all the Bud Lights were gone. So, my friend stole a Hop Devil out of the home owner’s basement fridge and proceeded to then hurl it across the room. Full beer went smash. Big mess. From that day on the Hop Devil has always been memorable. That being said, I never actually had one until this week. Like Sam Darnald who lurks in the background, it’s an average beer. Solid pine notes, not overwhelming, but a little heavy. Took a little while to get through, but overall OK.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A go to of mine for years. A nice deep copper color with reasonable head and lacing. The mouth feel is as good as there is outside of NEIPAs. What makes this one special is its delivery of both malt and hop tastes. As it should be, the slightly sweet malt is up front, followed by a lingering earthy and hoppy finish. This is a really good IPA that I've been drinking regularly for years and I never tire of it.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I reviewed this beer about 18 years ago. One of the originals. One of the best in this style. The beer that put Victory on themap. \n\nCopper color with great lacing. Dank hop smell with malt in the background. Slightly piney hops balanced with caramel malts. Still the best balanced. Nice bitter finish. \n\nStill reaching for this quality beer after all these years.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I liked this beers. An interesting mix of hops, earthiness, dank, not going for super floral and uber fruit, I'd like to have it again, it was in a mix pack, I remember being surprised.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cloudy copper on the pour, some head that dissipates quickly and lots of lacing. Aroma is very piney, with some fruit and malt. Taste is very hoppy with lingering bitterness as well. This is a very good IPA, but I'd rate some slightly better......like Bell's Two Hearted, Ithaca's Flower Power and Sculpin from Ballast."

Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6)\n\nPours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess. \nIf my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking. \nIt’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!\nIt smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say. \nThe taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say. \nYou guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd!

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I love wheat beers so I decided to try this Oberon because it was an American wheat, though it’s considered an Ale, which made be worry about it being too hoppy, like other “Hazy” beers on the market. \nThough I like a bit of hops/IPA’s, I don’t really want it in a wheat beer, which is not considered an “ale”. This offering is very good. It has a nice cloudy “haze” that all good wheat beers should have, and a great taste that goes down smoothly with very little bitterness. I’m happy of my first purchase of this interesting wheat beer and the only negative I could say is the attempt to add to much hops to make it a semi-IPA. Let it be a full-fledged Wheat beer and don’t feel the need to over-hop it! This beer is great, but would be even better if it didn’t try to be an IPA, my opinion. \nThe pour, head, color &amp; cloudiness is exactly what I look for in a wheat ale....I like this one a lot and will buy it again! Happy with my purchase.",

It is to American Wheat what Sierra Nevada is to American Pale Ale. It defines the style, delivering spice and citrus fruit flavors without adding fruit or spice, much in the same way that German Hefeweizen delivers clove and banana flavors with just grains, hops, yeast and water,"

I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as it was as usually coffee stouts are medium to coffee dominant. This one doesn't seem to be the case.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $5.99. No canned on date.\n\nLook: Jet black, opaque color with a dark tan compact two-finger head that slowly receded to a half of a pinky finger. This beer looks like it has very nice body - think and viscous.\n\nSmell: Lots of soy sauce/umami notes initially. Some fruity notes as well, along with some sweet licorice and roasted malts. I can pick out some dark fruit aromas like bing cherries, raisins, prunes, and figs. Surprisingly, I am not getting a lot of coffee on the aroma. Baker's chocolate, amaretto, and a touch of acidity. There's this nice perfumy note on the back end, which may be from the hops.\n\nTaste: This is certainly a big beer, yet it tastes incredibly smooth. Coffee certainly comes through in the taste up front. There is a bit of acidity up front that works well overall. The mouthfeel is nice - very smooth. The finish is decadent unsweetened chocolate. The flavors linger long and leave a rich feeling on the palate, even though the beer is very dry. There is also a sharp bitterness on the finish that leads me to think that the bitterness is coming from hops more than it is coming from roasted malts or coffee. The 12% ABV is hidden very well. And it's interesting that while the coffee flavor is pronounced, the coffee does not overpower the other flavors in the beer.\n\nFeel: The mouthfeel is lovely - very smooth. I was expecting the mouthfeel to be a bit thicker based on others' reviews. Nonetheless, it has a very nice mouthfeel.\n\nOverall: I haven't had this beer in a long time. I was expecting the beer to have a bit more of a coffee aroma, but it certainly tastes like coffee and I don't know when it was canned so I'm not really holding that against it. One thing that I really like about it is that to me it tastes like an imperial stout first, and a coffee stout second. To me, this has the character of an imperial stout, which then had coffee added to it as the label says &quot;Imperial Stout with Coffee&quot;...not &quot;Imperial Coffee Stout.&quot; Normally I would recommend not aging a beer with coffee, but I would be curious to see if age may allow this beer to become more rounded and showcase more of those lovely dark fruit notes.\n\nFrom the can:\nChocolate and roasted malts dominate the flavor, supported by notes of dark fruit, toffee, and caramel. A health dose of locally roasted coffee added to each batch further brings out the brew's chocolate notes and enhances the drinkability. This beer will continue to age for many years to come.\n\nGlassware: Goblet | Serving Tem: 50-55 degrees F | Pairs Well With: Creamy Blue Cheeses | Origin: Est. 1995 SD / CA",

I would be more likely to purchase this again if it came in smaller cans.",

Taste is strongly like coffee, black coffee. Lots of roasted malt, big on roasted malt. And a little bittersweet chocolate added in. Funny, but I really can't taste the coconut even though they say it's there. I guess my palate isn't sensitive enough. Mouthfeel is lively and full, medium thickness. Overall, it's a great beer but not quite unique enough to earn my highest marks. Some beers I can write on and on about. I can describe every little nuance, every little filigree and lace. For this one, I'm at a loss for words. It's not really inspiring to me. Honestly i don't really have a whole lot to say about it. Good enough to get me a little buzz though.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Black, deep and dark, completely opaque body topped by a khaki head, tall with excellent retention, thick and creamy. A thick wall of lacing is left as it does recede.\n\nAroma is not strong: roasted coffee, chocolate, and slightly sweet.\n\nInitial taste is vanilla, followed by roasted coffee, then chocolate, then the bitterness from the hops. All of this intermingles nicely throughout. The underlying sweetness of the malts is never more than a background foundation. The foremost flavors are the interacting of chocolate and roasted coffee. The finish is bitter, with the aftertaste being somewhat sweet and bitter with roasted coffee. The bitterness and the roasted malts linger. This is a big beer, but, apart from the expected effects, the alcohol does not become obvious until near the end, when the beer has become well-warmed to room temperature, and even then, it is just a bit of warming at the finish.\n\nThe mouth feel is smoothly creamy and moderately thick.\n\nOverall, excellent. The story of this beer is complex malty goodness with coffee. The coffee is not overbearing and integrates nicely into the other flavors."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Picked up a few a while back - opened the first on a special occasion.\n\nL - Nice pour, head not so thick, but hung around long enough to look nice and chewy.\n\nS - Nothing noticeable.\n\nT - Exquisite. Truly delicious. Deep, some sweetness, and excellent complexity of flavors. As compared to many other RIS, no bitterness at all, and not too sweet. Really great. ABV extremely well hidden.\n\nF - As expected, smooth and easy to drink.\n\nO - Definitely a world class beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, 2022 vintage\n\nHooooooo boyyyyy. Parabola. Finally. We don’t see much FW here in Mass, but thankfully a trip to Philly found me at Half Time on the way back, where I ended up with this gem, as well as Perennial Abraxas! I’m so hyped to try this so let’s just get into it\n\nPours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing\n\nThis beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut\n\nIt is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee\n\nA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat\n\nThis wasn’t mind blowing by any means, but it is pretty great. I grabbed a bottle from Half Time as well to cellar. Let’s see how this is holding up in 2 years",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev * Note: I am a beginner and this is the first beer I've loved. \n\nRating the 2015 bottle I just had. \n\nL: Almost black and pretty opague. Not too foamy. \nS: Chocolate, cherries, and coffee or maybe espresso\nT: My best way to describe this is that it tastes like someone poured bourbon or whiskey into a glass of red wine and mixed it with a chocolate bar-- but somehow some cherries fell in. Very strong, \nF: Smooth and thick like I like my women.\nO: This is so boozy and sweet without actually being too sweet like wine could be. Not sure how else to describe it. I took big sips but didn't rush it. I was so happy",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured the 2015 edition and it's now 2022, so I'll try and round these scores up where it makes sense since I think this is past its peak.\n\nL: Very dark brown (won't call it black), tiny head that recedes quickly and with little lacing.\nS: Raisins, roasty, some barrel.\nT: All sorts of things happening. When colder it matches the nose; as it warms you get rich dark chocolate, a little vanilla, and some booziness as well.\nF: Thick, smooth, dessert-like.\nO: Definitely should have opened this a couple years earlier but it's still one of the greats.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Looks almost black, small, quickly receding kh!ki head, no lacing.\nS: Snot locker gets some chocolate, dark fruit, fig or date maybe a bit of coffee and some leather. Kinky.\nT: This is tasty, all of the aforementioned odors, some licorice, char and cherry. \nF: Smooth, creamy, not much carbonation at all.\nO: This is damn tasty and it certainly takes the chill oughta' these old bones.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It is difficult for me to get as hyperbolic as the average ratings for Parabola. But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.\n\nI am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2019 vintage. Wonderful aroma of figs, coffee and anise. First sip is intense flavors of bourbon, followed with strong dark chocolate, licorice, and stone fruit. Long lingering finish, you do get a bit of alcohol hotness, but that comes with the territory. A truly world-class beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce bottle, 2021 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit/cherry, toffee, chocolate and earthiness. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, caramel, wheat, licorice, burnt/charred malt and rye. There's a lot going on here! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, creamy and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a really good overall brew. Wish I would have bought more of this when I was able to, will definitely buy more the next time I can!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2021 version, aged in bourbon, rye, and wheated whiskey barrels. It's hard to imagine I've gotten this far in my beer-drinking life and have never yet tasted any Parabola.\n\nAppearance: entirely black with a finger and a half of thick, creamy dark-tan foam atop. Beers like this really have a head-start on looking good, don't they?\n\nSmell: wood, malt, whiskey; maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure. There're notes of dark fruit as well, which you know I always love.\n\nTaste: rich, that's for damn sure. There's dark cherry and raisin and date and prune, of course, but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze. Very, very good indeed. Really, very wonderful.\n\nMouthfeel: thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth, rich creaminess.\n\nOverall: you never know what you're walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation, whether it's an oldie or something super hyped. This beer is just downright excellent.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up from liquor store for around $10-12. 2020 vintage No.11 printed on front label.\n\nAppearance - Black opaque body with a small, brown, creamy one-finger head with decent to low retention, good lacing and stick. Head easily regenerates with a swirl. 4.75\n\nSmell - Dark fruit. Plums. Very vinous, rounded out with some chocolate and roasted coffee character. 4.75\n\nTaste - Absolutely incredible. Flawless. Balanced. Bold up strong dark characters upfront but mellows out into a slow, rich, robust journey to a perfect aftertaste. 5\n\nMouthfeel - Smooth, creamy. Warming. 5\n\nOverall - No off characters whatsoever. 5",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of the very best non adjunct BA Stouts",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev There is depth to this that's pretty incredible.  I can smell licorice, bittersweet chocolate and musty whiskey barrel.\n\nThe taste is sweet with chocolate, cherry, wood and liquor.\n\nIt has a medium mouthfeel with a small amount of bubbly carbonation.  The finish starts complex with the licorice, chocolate and cherry, then fades to a long dry bittersweetness.\n\nWow, what a beer.  It's the most complex stout I've had but the flavors are never muddled; always clear.  I give it a 5.9 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap at the brewery. Pours black with beige head. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, sherry, dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, alcohol, herbal hops. Long almost dry finish. Delicious brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle into an odd shaped glass. 2021 release.\n\nLooks outstanding in the glass. Jet black body with an initial generous tan head. This shrinks to a faint ring, leaving scattered lacing.\n\nAroma of smooth boozy barrel aging with a little chocolate.\n\nOn tasting, this beer is triple aged in barrels. Normally the booze element would be overpowering, especially in a recent release. \nBut here, it is handled superbly. Mellow, smooth dark alcohol, with a hint of chocolate here and there. Dried dark fruit weaves in and out. \n\nMouth close to full, finish warm sweet booziness.\n\nOverall, just an outstanding beer. Rolls around the tongue beautifully. A must grab every time it shows up.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is the 2021 vintage. \n\nThe presentation on this beer is top notch: a boxed 12oz bottle that feels super classy to open and creates anticipation as you read all the info written throughout. The label also provides some information such as how many cases were bottled, the degree of color, IBU, etc. This is a level of detail that I have not seen anywhere else, and really adds to the experience. The beer itself is a pure black color with a dark tan head that is not just frothy, but almost solid, and sticks around for a long time.\n\nChocolate, roasted malt, coffee, leather, anise, some smoke, a hint of dark fruit like plum, some spice, hint of vanilla, and then the bourbon - not overpowering but just enough to assert its quality. Wood rounds this one out. Nothing overpowering, everything in its right place.\n\nStarts off with a bit of hoppiness actually, then covered quickly with roasted malt and coffee. Cherry and some other stone fruit. A hint of woodiness, spice, rum. Something sweet like coconut. Finishes with hints of leather and then a final boozy bourbon kick right at the end to remind you of the source of this treat.\n\nThere is a lot going on here, but it all somehow comes together. I'd love to see some age on this, but this was a fun drink for sure. A really complex one, and I'm sure I haven't covered all that this beer has to offer. I will try to pick it up again next time!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 100 score on BA - World Class. I'd think that would be recommended.\nFirst try on this, on the eve of another b-day in my 6th decade of life.\nThis is a 2020 consumed in a very hot (record setting) June day 2021.\nThat is one dark beer. No color highlights. Small dark beige head.\nDeep rich fruit on the nose.\nReally nice chocolate flavor that is bittersweet. Yummy. The abv is not over-powering in flavor enhancement but it hits quickly. The dark fruit lies in the background a bit, like dark chocolate on berries.\nBeing only a year old it still has some bright sharpness to the malt profile, nonetheless it is very smooth and holds a rich and full mouthfeel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 vintage boxed bottle, sampled June 2, 2021.\n\nAppearance: Bonus points for the nice box, beer is black and shows clear ruby edges with strong back light. A short lived tan head dropped off to a thin halo that doesn't lace.\n\nAroma: Heavy dark malt, bourbon barrel, dark fruit.\n\nTaste: Starts a little sweet, deep malt bill, then a toffee middle goes into an almost sharp bourbon barrel, hop bitter, hot alcohol finish. All of it glorious.\n\nMouthfeel: Sultry. Silky smooth, low carbonation, medium heavy body, slight chew, a little warm on the finish but fairly clean.\n\nOverall: Wow. It deserves the big numbers. Huge flavor, no flaws (but, it would be hard to tell), alcohol is kept low key and felt more than tasted. Boozy, malty, silky, hints of citric peek through, very complicated but well packaged taste profile. Easy drinking, it's a treat!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Can pour- dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frosty/foamy lacing and a ring of bubbles. Nose is vanilla and coffee for days. Taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness. Vanilla lingers on the finish. Tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2021 release from can. Poured from fridge temp. Pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. Sticks around for quite a while as well. Nose is incredible. Vanilla, marshmallow, coffee, dark chocolate, red licorice, burnt toffee, and a nice amount of dark fruit. The taste nicely follows the nose, but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. Vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. Definitely some charred wood, black licorice, roasted malts, almonds, and tar. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall a really nice coffee stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev After being impressed by the High West BA version of this a few weeks ago I figured I'd give this a shot. Quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site\n\nPours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs\n\nThe aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note\n\nA bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond\n\nA medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee\n\nDamn delicious beer right here. It hits all the notes expected and doesn't feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. I'd definitely get it again",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Yesss!\nWell, you might hate it - or you might love it!\nMy wife didn’t like it but I did. Even though I’m not so fond of Porters or Stouts but THIS ONE, I’m telling you was really good!\nVanilla and coffee. Vanilla is really present in the aroma, sweet, but like some cookies or sweets or a kind of a cake? Very pleasant. And its taste is just as good as it smells!!! This isn’t always the case, as I’m sure you must have observed that beers often smell “better” than they taste - but this one was astounding. Sweet but not syrupy, sweet like vanilla sugar. Coffee? Not 100% sure I could decipher it, but maybe overall the thing tasted like drinking a Starbucks latte with vanilla added on top? Oh yes, don’t forget about its booziness, which isn’t harsh at all, rather makes the whole thing taste and feel like an Irish coffee.\nThis was the first that I had of this kind but it made me curious, I think I might seek more of such coffee or vanilla or oatmeal-infused Porters or Stouts out. Worth giving it a try!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Initially: robust/strong taste. After several months of sampling Porters and Stouts, Victory at Sea sat AFRAID in the corner of the refrigerator...reattemped tonight; world class favorite!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smells like a starchy vanilla espresso. Tastes like one too almost, though the coffee is more pronounced and it almost has a dark chocolate taste. A good unique beer, though the smell is a bit too much for my preference.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Notes from 2/25/2020. \nOn tap at the Draft House in Austin and served in a 5oz snifter. \nThe appearance is dark brown with a thin tan ring of foam around the rim. 3.75\nThe aroma is medium in strength and of delicious chocolate covered caramel, and a little salt. How can a beer smell this good?! 4.75\nThe taste is moderately strong with chocolate covered caramel, roasted malt, boose, and a moderately bitter finish. 3.75\nThe mouth feel is above medium in thickness with moderate carbonation. 3.75\nOverall, it's very good but it's not quite my thing. I think it's how the bitterness mixes with the flavor. 3.75",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Ballast Point scores a home run with this big and bold imperial porter. The smell of vanilla greets you pleasantly and invitingly, not overpowering as your first sip brings you beautiful flavor notes of coffee and smoky marshmallow maltiness. This is an amazing porter- one of my favorites. Drinking this on a cold winter day - this beer is nearly perfect. I discovered this beer last year at a St. Patrick’s Day parade when I stopped at a local tavern and it made for a great day!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark golden brown color with tan cap and lacing.\n\nAroma at first of something like coconut, quickly followed by a vanilla laced light coffee which reminds me of a Kenya bean rather than something more robust from some other part of the World. Very clean and pleasant.\n\nTaste is more coffeeish than coconut with some elements of roasted malt yet it's restrained. Again coconut blends with vanilla but that's just my perception. That all sounds rather sweet but the brew doesn't come across as sweet in the taste as it does in the scent. It finishes clean and dry.\n\nMedium texture with balancing carbonation.\n\nOverall it's a refreshing take on the Porter/Stout style, very drinkable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle from Albertson's. Wow, just wow. Black gold. Chocolate and coffee,slick and oily. Campfire, burnt toast and coffee. Molasses, yum....and the vanilla for a little bit of marshmallow",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is my first time trying this beer and it doesnt dissapoint. Very dark, i would have thought it to be a stout. The vanilla smells hits you instantly followed by coffee and some roasted malt. The taste follows the nose to a tee, with the vanilla hitting first then the cofffe and malts backing it up. All in all this is the best porter I've ever had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Excellent well balanced Imperial Porter! It surprised me by being light for an Imperial. Quite enjoyable!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Ignoring the recent sale of Ballast Point to Kings and Convicts brewery, this is A GREAT imperial Porter! Their brewer notes description are right on for this. Notes of vanilla... Not to sweet.... low acidity.... Coffee comes through..... All flavors balanced so well! From bottle, an early Christmas present from my DW!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Unknown vintage; drank 4/24/16 @ the Yarchives. \n\nBlack/brown appearance. \n\nA rough pour yielded a huge tan head; a curtain of frothy lace. \n\nVanilla, roasted coffee bean &amp; milk chocolate notes in the nose. \n\nMedium thick mouthfeel. \n\nMilk chocolate &amp; vanilla flavors up front; fresh roasted coffee bean notes on the finish. No booze heat. \n\nA smooth, easy drinking treat."

I don’t like overly fizzy beers and this stout is about as watery as they come, while still maintaining a coffee and milk flavor (tastes like a plain latte).",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I bought a glass bottle of this at my local liquor store and drank it from a shaker pint. I found it to be dry for a milk stout, which is generally fine by me as I'm not a huge fan of sweetness in beer. I thought it tasted more of fig than coffee or chocolate. I'd definitely drink it again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I prefer other American stouts but this at least met expectations and I'd absolutely have this again. The flavors are there I just know you can find them in other places more intensely. Definitely worth a try especially if new to the style",

Dryish roasty aroma, notes of coffee, hints of woodwork, cocoa and liquorice. Low carbonation. Medium dry and very roasty flavour with a little lactose sweetness present, notes of strong coffee, a little dark chocolate and liquorice. Should not be drunk ice cold, cellar temperature is better. 1. rerate, 12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at the GBBF 2008 for takeaway (forgot that I had rated it previously). ABV was said to be 5.0%. Dark brown colour, nearly black, nice and lasting tan head. Notes of aroma: same as first time. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The flavour has still plenty of roasted malts and lactose sweetness, also notes of chocolate, mild coffee and some liquorice. Good stuff - I’m upping it a few points. Original rating: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Dark brown to black colour. Nice roasty aroma, notes of cocoa, hints of liquorice. Moderately sweet flavour, plenty of maltiness (probably also lactose).",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle poured into a stout glass. Pours black, opaque with a tan head that falls to a cap. Smell is coffee, cocoa, roast malt. Taste is sweet chocolate, coffee and cream on entry. Middle is where sweet gets evened out as hop bitterness creeps in. You get a bit of earthiness from the hops too, but again, everything is well balanced. Finish is roast, nuts, and a bit of cocoa. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Low, tight carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent beer with a ton of flavor that drinks easy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A really good stout",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a nearly completely black color with a soft, tan head. SRM of 24. (3.75)\n\nAroma: Mild aromas of chocolate and cream upfront. There is also a velvety, cherry, and licorice note. Not much coffee or roast. (3.75)\n\nFlavor: Smooth flavors of velvety, rich chocolate, There are some underlying red velvet and red &amp; black cherry notes here too. Mild roast and minimal coffee here. (4.00)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Minimal bitterness and roast so allows it to lean malty. (3.75)\n\nCompared to Firestone Walker's Nitro Merlin Milk Stout 1/10/21: Pours a similar color with a darker head. More cherry licorice on the aroma. Less coffee roast. Maybe slightly less bitterrness from the roast, but since it's not nitro doesn't feel as smooth. I mislabeled the two in a blind taste test. \n\nOverall: A pretty nice and easy drinking milk stout. I get some hints of red velvet, cherry, licorice. But overall minimal coffee and roast here. Appropriate sweetness, but the minimal roast allows it to finish slightly malty and fairly easy-drinking at 6%. (Final Rating: 3.85, the flavor helps it here with the rich cherry-chocolate flavor)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I am lactose intolerant, so I am not the expert on milk stouts, to me it tasted like a normal stout, with nothing too special about it when it came to it being a milk stout. It was a good stout though.",

A friend brought over a variety of their beers he received from a family member, and I tried several. Pours an amber color, it goes down lighter than it looks. Not much character to it.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Scrappy notes from 1989.\n*I first drank this beer on tap and in bottles in 1989 in Philadelphia, PA at a bar called Khyber Pass where I was performing music. The bottles were served very cold.\nIt has an 'old world' look and taste being pretty dark in color for most lagers I've had and it has a bit of a creamy medium sized head. Smells pretty malty and toasty. I believe I sense bread and some fruit and the fruit part of it is kind of crisp or zippy keeping the beer lively. The tap beer has more of this liveliness. It's really smooth and I can go through a few of them in one sitting no problem. I love it and it's delicious. I will get more!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev When it comes to cheap beer- this is my go-to. At a wedding? They probably have Yuengling. When it comes to beer- this was my first love. Low ABV means you can slam a case on a hot day. A little grassy flavor that pairs well with some malt. Sweet, but not too sweet. It’s a solid beer and an American classic. Are there better beers out there? Obviously. For its price point though, it’s the king.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look...Looks good enough to drink . Dark brown with a white well carbonated head\nSmell...Light hop malt ,very little smell as the usual with the lagers\nTaste...The mouth is hit with a sweetness that i really enjoy backing away with a drying bitter malt, toffee. \nFeel...a prickly carbonation that leads to an easy drinking capability. really good \nOverall...I enjoy this beer a lot and especially with food...i really do not understand the reviews for this beer , O well I must be the anomaly. I can deal with that. This is a beer i have drank occasionally for 20 years and seem to like it more now more than ever.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev When you want a beer real bad, this is a real bad beer. Never been a beer snob sniffing for notes of caramel or toffee, don't care about mouthfeel, just know when a beer is good, or it isn't. This isn't a good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a tallboy can , let sit out for 3-4 minutes before opening. Surprised that I haven't reviewed this yet. Doing a side-by-side with Yuengling's &quot;Premium&quot; [fyi , - nope! Not &quot;premium&quot; in any sense. ;)] , so might as well get 'er done, eh? :) \n\nClear amber, with 3+ fingers of pale tan head. Regardless of what the rest of it may be, it's a beautiful beer. Don't understand the low ratings for &quot;Look&quot;. ????\n\nSmell is light caramel/toffee with a slight bit of bread crust &amp;/or wet cardboard. An occasional hint of a fruity aroma. (Dried, but moist apple+prune?) . Not a bad smell, just not much of it. \n\nTaste is bread crust, plus faint hints of the caramel, toffee, and fruit present in the aroma. \n\nFeel is light-medium, smooth/slick initially, followed by moderate fine carbonation tingle. \n\nOverall, nothing &quot;wow&quot; about this beer, but then again, it's not intended to be that, nor has it ever been presented as such. Just a solid, &quot;I wanna beer&quot; beer. It's pleasant and easy-drinking, and gets the job done. It does what it needs to do. :)"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A very smooth citrus taste makes this, for me, more unusual than the usual slightly bitter or very tangy citrus. Worth drinking, for sure.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours copper color and creates a decent little white head. Nose is ignites the salivary glands at first inhale. Piney and citrusy fill the nostrils. Taste is not as bitter as I imagined, however there are hints of resinous goodness through the full taste profile. Very good IPA, but those words do not give it justice.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a typical West Coast IPA, that's for sure. I got more of the piney flavor than anything else, but there are a few different hops in here for sure. I didn't really get the mellow honey-like flavor that the description promised because of the amount of hops in there. If you like IPAs you'll surely like this one, but this is not my favorite style, so I tried it because I wanted to see if it was worth all the fuss. It's good, but not my thing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can into pint glass.\n\nL: Medium gold, about 1&quot; of head that fades a little but not completely. Good lacing.\nS: Resinous, a little pineapple action.\nT: West Coast through and through -- all pine, with a little floral character. Lots of malt backbone. Bitterness hangs on for a while.\nF: A little too thick for my preference. Definitely resinous but I don't think it's as dry as others.\nO: A solid beer. I think I prefer some of the other Jacks that FW makes, but if I'm really angling for a West Coast IPA it surely ranks among the best available in PA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Firestone Union Jack is delicious, a classic west coast IPA. Here in Colorado for reasons I ve not a clue you can t get the Great Grapefruit Ballast Point Sculpin IPA.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12 oz can:\n\nAppearance: Slightly hazy gold, ok head.\n\nSmell: Citrusy, mild sweetness.\n\nTaste: Nice citrus bitterness with honeyed bread malt body.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a Nonic. \n\nPours a slightly chill-hazed medium gold with a decent head and excellent lacing.\n\nQuite a range of aromas. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, caramel malts meet floral, grassy, and piney aromas. \n\nDefinitely West Coast, yet still rather well balanced, thanks to a proper start. Caramel malt and honey-kissed graham cracker on the tip of the tongue quickly gives way to grapefruit bitterness, which evolves quickly into a resin-fest in the mid palate, before that surrenders to a more delicate, restrained floral/grassy bitterness at the finish that hints at the deceptive bitterness that comes from a wild clover honey. \n\nMedium bodied, but well carbonated. Has a nice, relatively short and drying finish. \n\nFirestone Walker is not available in the Dakotas, so glad to have grabbed some of this one while in Illinois. This is a badass WCIPA.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev straight ahead go to IPA we never tire of it try others and keep buying this stuff. Some nice citrus but NOT yukky sweet or syrupy. Color head start finish aftertaste all good year after year.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Let's begin with two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug. The color is a bright copper-amber and fairly translucent. A modest head quickly disappears. There's a good hop presence for the nose, mostly piney and maybe a bit bitter. The balance between malt. hops, yeast and alcohol is very good. The malt is rich, but not overly sweet. Piney and resinous are the hops, then they leave with a clean bitter bite. Just the right amount of carbonation works well with the malt to provide a good mouthfeel. Amazingly rich and tasty for a brew with no glass lacing and minimal head. This is an AIPA deserving of the &quot;classic&quot; label."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very delicious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep and ruddy brown out of the bottle, resulting in an opaque body that borders on black when poured into a typical pint glass. A tight and creamy one finger thick head appears — over the next little while it collapses into a thick off-white cap that persists throughout. Thick lines of lace dot the glass throughout. \n\nWow, such delightful aromas of chocolate! For a stout that is not advertised as such, nor has any additives in that way, nor any ‘chocolate’ malts, it has a deep and rich cacao note on the nose. Caramel, toffee, moist cake aromas here as well, along with some toasted wheat. Very sweet character\n\nSurprisingly silky smooth sip, the flavours following the nose but bringing out more of the oat character, which gives the beer a thicker body and a twang of bitterness. Though it is not as bitter as you might expect, not from any hop bitterness or any burnt/roasted malt bitterness. There is just a touch to balance out the sweetness. It is lighter than expected as well, which allows the sweetness to mix without being too cloying. Chocolate, roasted caramel malt flavours dominate here. There is a gentle dark fruit flavour such as dark cherries you may notice on some sips. Some coffee on the front of the tongue but it fades quickly. \n\nSilky smooth body, the carbonation is lower and only gently pricks at your tongue, giving this a supremely smooth and creamy taste. It is medium bodied, lighter than you’d expect, and the finish is not as dry as advertised. A very gentle, subtle finish that leaves only a hint of chocolate, malt, and cacao beans in your mouth.\n\nSurprised by this beer, I would say it’s more subtle than you’d think. For an oatmeal stout, it definitely goes for balance compared to many others. With all that said, if you expect a typical strong roasted/almost burnt malt taste with strong oatmeal character and an oily body with unique bitterness, you will be disappointed here. If you’re looking for an easy drinking stout, this is great. If you’re looking for a stout with chocolate flavours that isn’t overwhelming like some chocolate stouts or a chocolate stout without lactose, this is an excellent choice.\n\nOverall it’s quite an excellent beer and absolutely has its place. I am glad I got two, as this is definitely an enjoyable beer you could knock more than a few back through the night.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured an opaque dark with no head and no lace. The scent had roast malt notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast and coffee presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev As the label clearly states &quot;The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout&quot;...\n\nPoured a full four finger tan head right up to the rim of the pilsner glass. Very sweet malt notes on the nose, almost like a fresh bran muffin. Not quite as opaque and dark as the Samuel Smith Taddy Porter in the glass.\n\nJust enough malt sweetness on the palate, like a really rich barley soup, full flavored without being overwhelming. Retains a little sweetness, whatever hops used are also light and sweet on the aftertaste. Perfect balanced flavor.\n\nBody exactly right, slightly oily weight, not too thin not too heavy.\n\nAs close to a perfect Stout as I have ever had. Been revisiting old favorites and finding myself pleasantly surprised how well many have held up over the years. There's only a tiny handful of beers I give a perfect score to, and this is one of them. In fact, if I was forced to only have one brand and type of beer the rest of my life, I would choose this one. Richer and sweeter than Guinness, this one stout ticks all the boxes for me. No negatives, all positives, right down to the ABV... It lingers on the palate, with the complexity of a good single malt scotch. If I haven't been clear I really really like this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Quality beer that pours a dark brown with a thick head. After trying the Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout, this one was a disappointment. A bitter hop flavor, it's not nearly as refreshing as the chocolate counterpart. I've had better Oatmeal Stouts, but you could do much worse. I'd probably never get it again at the price point",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep dark brown body, rapidly forming a solid, thick, mocha head, fine and with great retention.\nFruity chocolate aroma - cassis, blackberry, black cherry - not so much roasty or rich, and even lightly floral.\nThe taste follows suit, with fruity cocoa notes of dark fruit, acidic, with a bittersweet tang of espresso; medium light body and carbonation, verging on watery, although the oats, a bit of residual sugars, and a powdery feel help give it some substance; the semi-dry finish is long, with more roasty chocolate coming through, but still accompanied by distinct fruitiness.\n\nNot what I expected, one of the fruitier stouts I've tried, nevermind one that isn't deliberately incorporating fruit flavours, and lacking body. In the end, it's enjoyable, and probably more so if you know what to expect. \nEdit - what I tasted is so far off other reviews, my batch is potentially off",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I bought a bottle at the LCBO in Ontario 550ml at 5%. Poured a 2finger creamy head into pint glass.\nThe smell was very nice coffee and chocolate malts .\nTaste was very smooth and creamy oatmeal with a hint of toffee and coffee just sipping on it \nOverall this oatmeal stout is very enjoyable to drink leaving a lace all the way down but it feels stronger then 5%\nGood beer \nCheers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks like a stout should, and pours a nice thick tan head into a pint glass. Aromas are not as pronounced as some others maybe, but what is there very nice. The taste is excellent, with expected roasted malts beng the star. Nearly perfect balance and feel. One of the best stouts IMO, when you don't want any added fruits, coffee, etc. Perfect brew for a cool damp November evening. Every stout lover should know this world-class beer as a reference for the benchmark.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's an absolute classic. Bubbling, thick and rocky tan head. Coffee and toffee on the nose. The palate carries strong notes of coffee and malted barley with grassy hop-bitterness in the background. Moreover, one can tell this stout was brewed with good water, and the result is incredibly drinkable. In my opinion this is a perfect beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very good. One of my new favs.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Everything from Samuel Smith is excellent! This one is not exception. taste of Toffee/Caramel and Oats. What could go wrong.....smooth full bodied malty heaven.",

From May 8th 2021.\n\nLooks the part, very dark brown body, small tan head, scattered lacing.\n\nslightly roasted caramel malt.\n\nOn tasting, smooth, but still enough of a roast for balance. A little coffee.\n\nMouth between medium and full, finish lightly roasted.\n\nOverall, nice interpretation of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark brown almost black with a creamy brown head. The aroma is nice comprised of coffee, caramel, toffee, and oat. A slight herbal hoppiness as well. The is slightly sweet with a hint of bitter coffee to counterbalance it along with a slight hop tingle. Aftertaste is like roasted is like smores as the cocoa notes blend with the cracker malts. Mineral water base characteristic of Samuel Smith's other beers. The mouthfeel is medium and silky smooth. Goes down like a dream. Delicious."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: It pours copper with an off white head. Head retention is excellent. \n\nSmell: There are citrus aromas up front with some caramel. There are some pine notes in support with dried apricot notes. \n\nTaste: It has a definitive malt presence with caramel and citrus. The balance is nearly even with a slight tilt towards the hops. In addition there are pine and dried apricots. \n\nFeel: It has a medium body with strong bitterness in the finish without being harsh. \n\nOverall, a very good pale ale that is slightly balanced towards the hops.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev No canned on date…\nAppearance: Pours a dark orange copper, almost red in color. About a finger of white-yellow foam with good head retention and lacing down the glass. Translucent, but I think that is a more due to the color, there isn’t any floating sediment.\nSmell: Initial notes of pine and bready caramel malts with a subtle sweetness. Notes of apricot and tangerine are also present. Prevailing sweetness is present from the middle to the back with caramel, rye bread, and slight toffee malts. \n\nTaste: Bitter hops on the front end with pine, grapefruit, and orange rind that adds to the prevailing sweetness. I also get hints of apricot, tangerine, pineapple, and maybe some mango. Caramel and bready malt profile provides a solid back bone with a bit of rye spiciness on the back end. \n\nFeel: Medium carbonation gives the smooth mouth feel and enhances the malt profile and flavors. Thicker than I remember and maybe that is because it is slightly older. Minimal alcohol warmness and overall enjoyable.\n\nOverall: I think this beer is a bit on the older side, but certainly hasn’t gone bad. Malt flavors are a bit more pronounced, and the edge of the hops is taken off slightly but still enjoyable. Classic beer with great hops and beautiful supporting malt backbone. Always happy to enjoy this beer and I will definitely keep buying it.",

This one with its copper color and manilla head and lacing looks great, but not like a “pale” ale, ya know?\nThe aroma is subtle and complex, unlike the taste which grabs you for the ride. Piney and hoppy and citrus peels are odd bedfellows but work really well together here.\nThe feel was excellent, just really enjoyed drinking it.\nOA, definitely happy to have this locally available now.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's an alright beer to me. The flavor is not bad but not my favorite. It's very very dry citrus peel. As close as you could get to biting into the peel of a grapefruit. If that's your thing this beer is 5/5 because it's incredibly smooth with a pretty color and a complex smell. Although for me it was simply a well brewed beer that would be more enjoyed by others.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours black with a nice tan head with some lacing on the surface throughout. Smell is roasted malt with some chocolate notes. The beer delivers on its black chocolate promise but without becoming cloying or gimmicky. The first few sips have a big spicy alcohol hit before it settles in and you get used to it. Nicely balanced between bitterness from the roasted malt, some underlying sweetness, with that black chocolate note throughout. Heavy and boozy although it's tasty enough to have a couple.",

Initial taste of sweet malt and then an explosion of flavor from burnt toast, dark chocolate, oak and bitter black licorice lingering on the finish. This is a huge taste bomb with various layers. The high ABV is somewhat hidden. Moderate-light body with fine carbonation. Slightly slick with a lingering stickiness on the lips. Although I expected a slightly thicker brew, the overall feel is quite good. Sip this slowly and roll it around on the tongue to get the best experience. I would definitely buy this again.",

As it airs, the barley and malts take a backseat as tremendous dark chocolate emerges from its charry cocoon, bold and unmitigated.\n\nFeel:\nThe very definition of a stout: dense and full-bodied. Carbonation shows restraint, content with becoming lost in a warm, boozy, woodsmoke linger.\n\nTaste:\nCopious quantities of scrumptious, bitter black chocolate, subsumed by an avalanche of booze-drenched dark grains and black bread suffused with charcoal smoke.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Minimal head which is slightly tan in color. Moderate chocolate aroma. Certainly feels like a true stout, with strong malt flavors and a slightly bitter finish.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My youngest daughter, who is much more of a beer drinker than her older sister, gave me one of these in a mix 6er at Christmas. She lives in NYC and it was a mix of local beers. This stout had very nice chocolate flavors and excellent mouthfeel, but it's very boozy. I think my abv cap is closer to 7.5, but it was interesting to try and it was a great gift.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 edition.\nPours black with small tan head, left no lacing and faded fast.\nSmells really inviting. Nice dark chocolate with tons of roasted notes and some light vanilla sweetness.\nTaste follows the nose. This is an awesome flavour profile. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, some coffee on the back, and 0 alcohol so this one’s a bit dangerous.\nThe mouthfeel is sadly kind of thin. Not super full bodied like what I expected for a big stout but it doesn’t ruin the experience. Carbonation is light and the finish is smooth and dry.\n\nOverall, this is a really cool beer and I’m glad I got to try it. It’s balanced very well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L:. Pours a dark black with a small tan head and no lacing on the glass.\n\nS:. Sweet dark chocolate, a hint of vanilla, some smoke and ash, a touch of caramel and tobacco.\n\nT:. Sweet dark chocolate, roasted malt, a nice touch of vanilla, and it finishes with a nice long lingering smokey roasted bitterness. Really like the taste of this.\n\nF:. Smooth silky body, little lighter than expected.\n\nO:. It's nice to have a normal imperial stout without all the crazy stuff in it, and this one is fantastic.",

Then a body of cold brew coffee and chocolate. \n\nFeel: Thick and coating. Covers the palate. Big bitterness. Medium alcohol. Smooth carbonation. \n\nOverall: A great example of the style and one tasty brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a bottle, 2020 edition. I've had this many times years ago, but not recently - and only realized now that I've never reviewed it! A blizzard is currently rolling in to Boston so this sounds like a perfect time to sit and sip.\n\nLooks good, a silky thick pour with near-black brown color and a fine brown head that fades quickly. Minimal-to-no lacing.\nSmell and taste are big and full of roasted malts. Black coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and burnt caramel, with a slightly metallic earthy quality. Prominent bitterness lies under the layers of flavor.\nFeels medium-full bodied, with a depth of flavors but not overwhelmingly sticky. Bittersweet and dry finish. No perception of alcohol heat, only as it warms me afterward.\n\nOverall fantastic. To me, this is the &quot;quintessential&quot; American (Russian) Imperial Stout. All-grain brewed, no actual chocolate or other adjuncts in the recipe"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap in Wisconsin. Just what I want in this style. Very smooth and drinkable with some sneaky alcohol. Went great with my meal. Had this a couple times and will choose it again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's a great Doppelbock. But if you were never a fan of Doppelbock, this one won't change you.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very dark, opaque, almost black, with a garnet tinge around the edges, and two fingers of light brown head that dissipates quickly - to be expected given the 6.7% ABV. The smell is rich and powerfully malty, with sweet dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, and beef broth. The taste mostly follows the nose, but is not quite as strong, which I found slightly disappointing, but at the same time makes this beer more drinkable - almost dangerously so. The warming spirit alcohol is noticeable but unobtrusive, and wouldn't slow you down all that much from necking this stuff if you didn't know better. Overall an intense, complex, rewarding beer -in other words, par for the course for a Doppelbock, and another home run from Ayinger.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours deep ruby with an enormous khaki head, which sticks around, and leaves quite a bit of lacing all the way down to the bottom. \n\nRich malty goodness on the nose. Almost a bit like beef consomme as well, which actually follows through on the palate. Good fresh baked brown bread.\n\nEntry is semisweet, complex. The malt, the brown bread, that faintly meaty beefy note I always associate with bock style. \n\nFeels good and heavy, just this side of overpowering I would say. Really stays with you, without that overhopped bitterness some bock, doppel or otherwise, can have. A real mouthfiller...\n\nOverall this may be the ideal doppelbock, perfect expression of the style. I've been going back and reviewing a lot of old favorites, and I'm about to branch out into some of the more modern expressions, so I'm thinking of beers like this as setting the standard. This Ayinger has got a bit of a potent ABV, not so much as a Belgian ale or a modern IPA, but combined with that lingering aftertaste, makes for a pretty satisfying bottle. And I also think something should be said for the label, which may be the coolest label of any beer I can think of right now... Two goats (two goats get it?) rampantly celebrating a pretty large footed, dimpled glass of doppelbock... Truth in advertising! Putting this one up at the top rank with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as maybe the ideal expression of a variety. \n\nAs a side note, I'm old enough to remember when American Brewers like Pabst and Yuengling used to put out their seasonal spring bocks; in fact my grandfather used to bring a case or two of the Yuengling bock back in the trunk of his Galaxie, from our Easter trips to Pennsylvania, which was right around the time they seemed to release these beers back in the day. I remember the steel cans of Pabst Bock with the goats head on them...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours very nicely, about an inch and a half head that dissipates quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. Looks very nice in the glass! It’s almost black, like a deep blood red but more opaque than some ruby red beers (like Guinness, which is a bit clearer)\n\nThe smell is malty and coffee like, with a bit of fruit, reminds me of dried cherries covered in dark chocolate. Taste is very complex, smooth and malty at first, like toasty graham crackers but evolves over time into a mild spicy flavourful mix of mild fruits, raisins, caramel. Very savoury beer! The mouthfeel isn’t exceptional but by no means bad, it’s very smooth with low carbonation — I think I got an older bottle. \n\nIt tastes how you want a beer to taste when you hear it’s a world class, complex beer. Some folks say it doesn’t linger on the tongue, but my experience was completely opposite. An exceptional double bock, with the caveat that I’m just getting back into beer and haven’t had many double bocks, it’s excellent amongst all beers I’ve tried!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 1/27/2022 - coffee colored, thin cream colored head; rich full bodied flavor with a distinctive but odd aftertaste; good, but not remarkable mouthfeel; a good looking tasty beer, no complaints.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The general consensus seems to be that this one is the best of the Doppelbochs and it's hard to dispute. From the first pour to the finish it is a first class treat. Clear, extra dark brown appearance and large tan head with moderate lacing. Complex aroma of cinnamon graham crackers, caramel, toasted malts and dark fruit. Rich malt flavor that i would need a thesaurus to do it justice. Full bodied, modestly carbonated mouthfeel leading to a long, lingering finish. Highly recommended.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 7/20/21\n\nAlright, time to knock out another style topper! This one is always being discussed on the forums, but I can never seem to find it near me.

Let’s crack it open and see if it earns its title\n\nPours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of light brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nIt’s just straight up malty goodness in the nose here. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bready malt, toast, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and molasses\n\nIt’s pretty similar in taste, but it takes on a bit more of an aggressive taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, dark toast, herbal hops, apple skin, toffee, sweet cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, molasses, burnt sugar, raisin, smoke, and herbal hops\n\nA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a rich beer. Finishes off dry\n\nThis is great stuff, a classic for a reason. I’ll definitely have to pick up more",

Thin beige ring and patches. \n\nSweet malty nose. \n\nCreamy, dark bread, dried fruit, roasted sweets, all the checkmarks. \n\nSmooth mouth, very light carbonation.\n\nThis is a successful example of beer that's going for the essence for a style. Great yummy beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful tan head- be careful on the pour as it will stack up. Dark cola color and beautiful malty aroma. Smells sweet and earthy. The flavor makes you slow down and examine it. Not as sweet as others of the style, but filled with nuance. Dark bread and toasted malt followed by raisin and charred fruit. The finish is perfectly, mildly dry with a pleasant lingering of malt. Moderate to low carbonation. I’ve had many dopple bocks and I love them- but this one stands in it’s own class as one to be savored and pondered. Very glad I picked this one up.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz-ish bottle purchased from the Dorset Store. Pours dark dark brown - almost black - with one finger worth of head that recedes slowly but surely. Tastes of thick burnt malt with raisins and burnt fruit. Full and good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Ayinger's Celebrator is a double Bock brewed out of Bavaria. It has a remarkably dark brown color with an off-white head. The nose smells of candied fruits, which the flavor profile is as well. It's full bodied, but I'd prefer it last longer on the tongue before giving way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wonderful beer, which inspired me to create my account on this website. Scents of raisins, ginger, vanilla, and fresh cut oak. 1 inch head. The beer is clear, and surprising light considering the ABV."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Punkin Ale brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.00% This Pumpkin Beer pours out of a glass bottle into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with Pumpkin an Spices. Some of the spices are cinnamon pumpkin nutmeg an others. You also pick up a nice amount of grains an malts in the small as well. So far Punkin Ale is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with pumpkin spice , really puts you in that pumpkin pie state of mind. Not saying that is a bad thing. If you are a fan of pumpkin pie this brew is a must. Just the right amount of spicy, pumpkin mix. There is nothing overpowering about this pumpkin ale, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The body of this brew is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold Pumpkin, Sweet, Spicy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Punkin Ale a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the opportunity to. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery did a super nice job with this style of brew.",

Stored at home at 40 degrees. Reviewed 19/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.\nGreen ink on neck “Feb 2022”. Served at 45.5 degrees in a hand washed and dried John Smith imperial pint glass. Final temperature 52.7 degrees. \nAppearance – 4.\nFirst pour – Pale gold (SRM 3) with slight greenish tint, clear. \nBody – Deep gold (SRM 6), faint haze. When rear-lite, same.\nHead – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), darker than floral white and lighter than Dutch white, medium density, average retention, diminishing to a three mm crown and a complete cap with a few rocks. \nLacing – Poor. A few drag marks as the level drops.\nAroma – 3.75 – Light pumpkin spices, predominantly clove and allspice, no malt, no hops, no yeast, no pumpkin. \nFlavor – 3.25 – Flavor follows nose - no yeast, no malt, lightly sweet and no hops. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. No gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. \nPalate – 3.5 – Thin, watery, soft carbonation. \nFinal impression and summation: 3.5 Billed as “Brown ale brewed with pumpkin and spices” but there are darn few brown ale characteristics and the pumpkin appears imaginary. My fruit fly drinking buddy, however, has a fatal attraction to it.",

This unwanted assault slowly desists as the beer airs but  if it ain’t a horrible first impression… blegh.\n\nOverall:\nLet it breathe or pay the price. Don't wait too long though, gotta drink it while its still cold. Very nice once those harsh introductions are over.",

Body is medium-light.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look – Transparent copper body with two fingers of off-white head.\n\nAroma – Nutty aroma with big cinnamon and brown sugar. Pumpkin is solid throughout, but I am digging the toasted malts from the base brown ale\n\nTaste – Pumpkin shines much brighter here and it is the dominant flavor…perhaps too dominant. It’s all I can really taste. Some subtle spice notes try to fight their way to the front of the line, but the pumpkin just keeps pushing it back. Not saying it’s bad tasting, not at all, but it is a one trick pony on the taste\n\nMouthfeel – Nice and full. Medium carbonation. Good lingering pumpkin flavors.\n\nOverall – I wish the taste had more diversity, but hey, the pumpkin fans will like it. At 7% it is bigger than most standard pumpkin beers, but it still shouldn’t be a challenge for even the most casual beer drinkers to put down.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The most noticable thing about this to me is the complexity in the flavor.

Overall, takes a second glance - kind of eases into you like the shortish female with the good personailty, without big curves, not obnoxious but bright, who people are not paying all that much attention to and then later, away from the noise, you realize she is maybe the most attractive woman, with incredibly complimentary features, you have seen in months, if not years.

Taste is tropical fruit, mango and pineapple, dank pine, more floral notes, honey, and lemon. Pretty nice balance between the pine and the tropical sweetness, with a nice malty finish. The bottle has a BB date of feb 4, so maybe it’s not as crisp as a fresh one. Still, really a good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Crystal clear amber-gold, large white head, good lacing.\nAroma: Pilsner malt underpinning supports the fruity, resinous hops that follow.\nTaste: Flip flops the order noted in the aroma. Hops more dominant, flush with pine and tropical fruit. \nMouthfeel: Finishes with enough maltiness to keep things interesting and refreshing while still hop-centric.\nOverall: Lingering and lasting, well carbonated, full bodied.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great imperial IPA",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rich orange color, decent head, strongly alcoholic, sweet malt base and - most importantly to me - an earthy, piney rush of flavor that balances out and eventually overwhelms the citrus and floral tastes that I find so unappealing in all but the very best IPAs. \nI understand why many who appreciate the hazy and flowery side of aledom don't like it much, but it's just up my alley and is my go-to on weekend afternoons when I have no responsibilities.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle pour - deep golden honey color with thick white head leaving significant foamy/frosty lacing. Nose is earthy and floral with hints of citrus and pine. Taste follows with a malty backbone and lingering bitterness on a dryish finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Another boring beer masquerading as an IPA. Flavorful, but not with hops. Not bitter, smooth, but ultimately unsatisfying and difficult to identify its ingredients. I don't get the hype.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've had this one several times over the years and enjoy the first few sips, but eventually feel like it's all bitter hops without much else going for it. Maybe just not my style of beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Color clear amber\nScent piney and grapefruit orange \nTastes a good mixture of bitterness and fruit. Don’t see this as world class but more as excellent. I like Doubles that have more fruit forward than this. One of my favorites is golden monkey",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.7%. Golden colour, slightly hazy. Moderate white head. Hoppy aroma, notes of pine and spruce, hints of citrus and caramel. Distinctly hoppy flavour, piney and resinous notes, also grapefruit. Very bitter finish, but also very moreish and drinkable for its strength.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hoppy tones and smooth Carmel aftertaste that lingers on tongue. Fantastic",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: pale straw yellow. Very bright and inviting\nS: very herbal with a nice pine presence. \nT: perfectly executed. Pine and citrus, with an earthy background. Phenomenal.\nF: medium body. Pretty light \nO: I don’t know what category this DIPA would fall in but it is in a class by itself. Most unique and unmistakable taste you will find",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Th beer is a pale straw color but with a decent white head. It is clear. On the nose, rose notes and bitter herbal notes are present. Maybe its the label art, but it smells like a pine forest. On the palate , it is nice a bitter. the same hops notes from before are present but with citrus as well. The malt is there an similar to white beard with some whole wheat flour mixed in. The hops dominate the taste though expect for the finish but before the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is foamy but the body isn't great. The bubbles aren't pointed. Overall, a good well hoped IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap at CityWorks. Tremendous lacing like a solid wall.clear, low carbonation, not a heavy alcohol tang.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells bright and hoppy with a bit more of an alcohol taste than your average IPA.\n\nThe taste is a little sweet up front with a little maltiness but it soon gives way to a strong hoppy grapefruit with subtle notes of orange, orange zest, orange spritz or orange oil, lemon, lemon juice, lemonade, pithy lemon rind, lemon peel, lemon zest, lemon oil, tangerine, citrus, tropical fruit including but not limited to pineapple, mango, star anise, kumquat, not coconut but guava, passion fruit, jackfruit, pomegranate, cherimoya, rambutan, persimmon, a lot of apples, I'm no apple expert but the kind of apples they use for pies also golden delicious, red delicious, granny Smith, pink lady, fuji, honeycrisp and other apples, apple peel, peaches, nectarine, kiwi, banana chips, crab apples which although aren't edible but you can taste them and spit them out, elements of graphite, barbed wire, quick drying cement, pine but not just any pine, Douglas fir, red pine, longleaf pine, Virginia pine, pine tar, pitch, sap, and possibly hops.\n\nThe mouthfeel is light with a lot of fizz. It finishes clean and bitter and follows the nose?\n\nIn all seriousness overall this is an exceptional IPA. Besides the smell the alcohol doesn't really come through. I give it a solid 5.5 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent clarity in a yellow-orange beer showcasing active carbonation that feeds a 2 finger pillowy stark white head. Layers of lace cling to the glass with each sip. Juicy pine, grapefruit, and resin highlight a well rounded aroma profile. Bold but not too aggressive, almost a savory hop profile. It's juicy up front, grapefruit and resinous in the middle and then it finishes with a zesty pine. There is a an aggressiveness to the finish and a lingering boldly hoppy aftertaste. The body stays on the lighter side, somehow making for an almost refreshing sip and making this as dangerously drinkable as it is sipable. Really good selection from Victory here.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dank Dank Dank. Piney and very hoppy but it defines the term dank, and in a good way. Drink this one by itself. No food pairings just sip, swish, savor and swallow. After you appreciate all that then open another to wash down your Beef, Ribs , Mexican etc. It will stand up to them all. But you owe it to yourself to enjoy that first one by itself.\nBest DIPA that is easy to find.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear, bright golden coloring, lush white, long-lasting head. Lookin' fine. That ain't no lie.\n\nAroma: honey-sweet, tropical fruit bitter. Citra? Mosaic? Another hot hop I haven't thought of? Nicely balanced, plenty of hop flavor, little bitterness.\n\nTaste: Hop bitterness right away, gliding the palate, stays calm and cool. Modicum of sweetness strokes the tongue, bumps up against bitterness, and the slide together down the throat. Malt body is medium-ish, light, not getting in the way of the hops. Alcohol isn't felt, but hinted at. Oh, wait, there it is…\n\nDirt Wolf isn't a pretty name, but I assume it has links to the lore of hops. Before I check the label to see for sure, I will add my final thoughts. This is right on the money, delicious, balanced double IPA that perfectly fits the mold set by Bell's HopSlam. It's a good formula that's proven popular. And easy to market: &quot;Can't find any HopSlam? Think HopSlam's too expensive? Try this, it's just as good!&quot; I almost wrote &quot;almost&quot;, but, really, it's just as good.\n\nNot a tongue-ripper, not a palate-destroyer, just a nice, hoppy pleaser, with an onset of alcohol. mmm, hmm.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm a local and it is my &quot;go-to &quot; IPA. Good citrus, nice smell of grapefruit, and a bit of pine but what I really like is the smooth mouthfeel. The 8.7% alcohol content is accurate and makes me feel &quot;comfortable&quot; after a glass but helps with the enjoyable experience. It is an excellent Imperial IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Had DirtWolf poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped &quot;ENJOY BY 10 NOV 2020,&quot; into tulip pint.\n\nLooks like a classic West Coast IPA, with a citrusy, dank aroma to match. Drinks juicy and finishes bitter with a bit more malt than typical, a plus in my opinion.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev An absolutely beautiful pour. Even cold, there's a lovely soft white head and plenty of lacing on the quickly emptying glass. Steadfastly on the clear side, even during this unfiltered/hazy era. Not much aroma, but the nose will tell you the taste of hops will follow. That taste is just about perfect. The malts provide a solid background while the sharp dry hops deliver all you could hope for. This is so tasty, so smooth going down and brings a perfect hop delivery, at 8.7 ABV, this could be trouble."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Well, it’s Bud. Not going to do a classic review here because it’s not that type of beer, but just write out some thoughts.\n\nSyrupy taste with that classic, macro malt liquor skunkiness that has that weird savoury oily character. A little bit of bready character, a bitterness that is more metallic twang than hoppy, and you have a classic adjunct lager.\n\nI am neither a proponent nor hater of this beer. I think snobs will always despise any macro lager and sometimes even the people who drink it. On the other side, people love to say ‘dude for a lawn mowing beer it’s what you want dude’ (not sure how lawnmowing became that de-facto go to for this) but I tend to be unpersuaded by that. For the price, while it is cheaper than some craft and ‘craft-macros’, you can find absolutely comparable priced beer that doesn’t taste terrible. In any style as well, lager, Pilsner, IPA, even German styles. Unsurprising with how tight the market is, plenty of beers without any adjuncts at all are out there for the same price.\n\nSo, if you like Budweiser, just say ‘Hey, I like this’. Who cares? You can enjoy any beer without needing to justify it, really. I was slightly surprised drinking this that it wasn’t as bad as some have described, and it’s not exactly unpleasant. The syrupy skunky character gives a taste in the mouth sort of like slightly pungent, off tasting cheese, but that’s about the worst of it. Though I am always surprised I tend to be like +10 to +20% on these ratings for the ‘bad beers’. I don’t think Bud outright fails which would put it below a 2.5 for any of the rankings, but hey. Like I said earlier — a preference is a preference and it’s okay to enjoy or dislike something!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I like Bud overall. I fault the water, it is hard water. Better on a hot sunny day.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’ve never understood the hate that surrounds Budweiser. For what it is it’s amazing. Clean,crisp and refreshing adjunct lager. Bud has never let me down, but if you are looking for an IPA or hoppy micro brew then you will be let down.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dorm beer. That's about it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bought a 25oz can $2.29 Whole Foods\n112 days before best by date\nSmell of corn\nLight clear golden color\nMedium-heavy mouthfeel. kind of syrup like\nMedium carbonation\nTaste of corn, malt, light bitterness finish\nOverall better than I remember. Maybe the bolder craft beers have made this beer less hard than I remember. Basically a beer to drink when you are focused on who or where you are drinking and not what you are drinking. Does not distract from food flavors so good to have with any food.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev How did this become the dominant American macro-brew? It's not the best, and it's certainly not the cheapest. Good marketing I suppose, and a fantastic can design. The red, white, and black are very easy on the eyes. Syrupy corn taste with a skunky aftertaste. It is light and may taste better in the summer, but I'd reach for several other cheap beers before ever buying one of these.",

No. For its place in the world tho its as good as it gets. A great session beer at affordable price that you can share and share and share without getting bitter.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is different from bud of memory. A light American lager. Crisp and dry, this is a bit sweeter than I remember, 20 some odd years later. Light bubbles easy drinking and good for the style. This is a warm day drinking beer. Nuff said.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look - clear golden with a white head\nSmell - grainy corn slight citrus\nTaste - pretty much like the smell of the beer, grainy corn slight citrus\nFeel - Light body with a medium carbonation\nOverall - Just not a fan",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had this loads of times, especially when younger...time for a review!\n\nMega pale, ok head...light ricey malty aroma...\n\nQuite sweet, not much in the way of hops. It has beechwood aging apparently. The rice gives it quite a light crispness that makes it easy to drink fast. A bit on the sweet side, needs more hops and more beechwood ageing as I can't actually taste it ; ) An easy drinking beer that is great for beer newcomers, but nothing special ; )"

Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!\n\nPours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nThis has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast\n\nWhere it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt\n\nA medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness\n\nIt's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle",

Resembles a Scotch Ale or dubbel.\n\nT: this beer delivers as advertised; a heavy-hitting hop bomb cloaked in a ton of malt. The aging effect is evident as there is plenty of sugar on each sip. The prune-raisin combo is omnipresent and increasingly dominant with each sip.\n\nF: this is a mildly viscous, smooth beer. Virtually no alcohol burn and minimal carbonation. Goes down relatively easy for a 10% ABV.\n\nO: worthy of the wait and neat to be able to drink a 15-year old brew that was intentionally set aside for future consumption by a world class brewery.",

Sweet caramel and alcohol notes with a touch of hops. \nT: tastes like a malt bomb explosion of high alcohol sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar up front. Then the self-proclaimed unreasonable amount of hops pokes through. Noticeable alcohol warming and vodka-like aftertaste. Moderate bitterness and hops balance out the sweetness making this a well-balanced, if unusual concoction. \nM: Body is fairly light and syrupy, like a day old coke. \nO: I think this beer is awesome.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazy light brown body, with a fizzy head. Smell is deep and sweet; roasted malt, caramel, raspberry, pepper, hints of spice and esters, a bit of chocolate. Taste is also fairly sweet; immediately comes the spice, with coriander, and pepper; orange peel and citrus too, followed by a strong malty backbone. The kriek comes out on the finish, with cherry and raspberry that add a sweet balance to the upfront spice. Fairly high carbonation, and the ABV is quite noticeable. This is bigger than I expected, and while I very much enjoy the complexity it comes off a tad unbalanced.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Three Philosophers pours a medium, cloudy brown beneath an off-white two finger head. Actual chocolate flakes do float about the bottom of the glass, the cherry ale lightens the color and eye appeal of this brew. Chocolate, cherry, almond and sugary notes create a parfum more admirable for complexity than actually enjoyable. The taste is perplexing. The chocolate and cherry flavors stand apart, rather than melding. Hops, malt, and an overbearing fruit sweetness collide to create a delicate, fussy, overthought delight, with a saccharin mouthfeel aftertaste, much like marzipan. I never understood the appeal of marzipan. Pretty much the same here. I get the mission, I sense quality ingredients. It just doesn't ring my bell.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev As I scroll down the reviews, I see a lot of variation. This one's a dark amber, lots of sediment, which ain't a bad thing. Prune, cherry, and tang (not the orange juice) are noticeable first, then a sticky thickness. THEN the alcohol (again, not a bad thing. Notes of bread on the back channel. I had a 4-pack a while back and forgot to review, enjoyed it then and now. A lot like an unsweetened thick cider that's fermenting to alcohol instead of vinegar.",

Dark fruit.\n\nFlavor &amp; Aftertaste: Alcohol noted. Some chocolate notes mixed with caramel. Faint, mild cherry flavor. Dry start to finish.\n\nMouth-feel: Light to medium bodied, high carbonation. \n\nOverall: Demonstrates quite a jarring bite between the higher ABV &amp; high carbonation. Gets your attention. Label mentions cherries, but that's pretty well hidden in there. But, as you drink it, you start noticing the tart, sour finish. Highly effervescent. Visually, it promotes a lengthy, creamy looking head, more so than most beer styles. I'll admit, this beer is not my normal cup of tea. But, it's interesting and a nice change of pace. Not quite sure where it fits into my seasonal/regular beer routine. Well worth a shot.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I cannot believe Ive never reviewed this beer! I used to drink the 750 corked and caged bottles of this beer on the regular!\nTonight I have a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter.\nThe beer pours a rich mahogany color with deep garnet undertones when held up to the light. A dense creamy beige head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a very sturdy surface layer that sticks around through the sampling.\nAroma on this one features some toffee and brown sugar and a bit of tart cherry note. Almost a little funky too, but no hop notes and the abv is well hidden at this point.\nFirst sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly, yet soft carbonation. The beer feels a little slick, I expected and remembered more of a sticky feel, but its what Ive got right now.\nFlavor is some brief brown sugar and a bit of dark fruit, raisins mostly. This rolls to some faint tart cherry notes and a little bit of a black peppery bite, which I attribute to the ABV. Even with this bite, the drying finish encourages me to take another sip, which gets me to emptying my glass much to quickly. \nQUite a nice beer that Im glad to have revisited. Definitely a classic and one I will gladly drink again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 16 oz can into a Teku glass. Deep mahogany in color, fluffy white head, slowly receding. Watch that pour because this guy will get a little out of control. Scents of raisins, dates, prune juice and red wine. Flavors of baking spice, oak, brandy, dark cherries, prune, fig. It’s funny, I’ve been drinking 3 philosophers for years now but just realized I have never rated it. First time I’ve tried it from a can- no discernible difference from bottles but I also haven’t tried them head to head. I do appreciate the pint vs ~12 oz volume though- basically the same price between 4 cans and 4 bottles but going to have a nice buzz on by the time I’m done drinking a pint! Maybe the best Belgian style beer I’ve had from the US. I always like to pick up some of these when the weather starts getting cold and reminds me of decorating the Christmas tree.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev For my money this is as good as an American Belgian style beer can get. I tried this for the first time about 10 years ago, somehow never reviewed. I saw it in the local gas station in Delhi NY, about 30 minutes from the brewery. I knew nothing about it, but it was the only craft beer available, so I bought a six pack (well truthfully I also bought a sixer by Saranac, but that is an entirely different story). Needless to say I wasn’t expecting much. When I poured the first bottle into a goblet, it had a billowing three finger frothy head and gorgeous brown color with ruby highlights. Next I discovered a pleasant cherry and malt aroma. Then I had the first sip, and I couldn’t believe my taste buds. Cherries, plums, raisins, molasses, a subtle bread-like yeast, and a nice malt backbone. I took another sip, and it was just as good. Somehow the beer I bought between the Miller and Bud at my crappy local gas station was clearly a world class beer. I had previously lived in Colorado, and enjoyed New Belgium, but this was better! These days Ommegang is nationally known because of its Game of Thrones beer. But 3 Philosophers is truly the one and only king of American made Quads.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev August 13, 2021 - Opaquish dark copper color, nice cream color head slowly recedes to a cap, and then to a ring, no lacing; A noticeable aroma - citrus tangy, fruity; Mouthfeel is quite good; The flavor is odd, and leaves a yucky aftertaste? Well, let's see if it grows on ya. It is robust. And sour, but not too sour, but it has a bad flavor I can't name. I do not like it.\n\nAugust 20, 2021 - Second bottle much better. Whatever that bad taste was it didn't recur. So its not bad. The 9.7 ABV is quite noticeable, not in the flavor, but in the effect. So I must have gotten a skunky one before. I raised the score for taste and overall.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a pint can into a pint mug\n\nL - Clear amber in color. Substantial light tan head three-fingers thick which settles to a complete and persistent layer. Lacing is present thanks to the thick ring of foam along edges of the glass though the head is so thick it takes a while to display. Looks like a glass of honey.\n\nS - The cherry aroma is at the forefront. Very strong and sweet. Malt of brown sugar/molasses on the backend. No hops to be found. Smells just like a holiday fruitcake. Not detecting the typical notes found in lambics however.\n\nT - A cornucopia of flavors intermingling. It's very hard to nail down individual ones. The typical fresh tartness and earthiness of the kriek yeast are dominant on the palate. It's sweet but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Fruitcake in a glass would be a fair comparison. Cinnamon spices and brown sugar mix expertly with the cherries. There is a slight medicinal quality that a bit off-putting, possibly from the high gravity. Some may like that, but I don't. Thankfully it doesn't mar the experience too much.\n\nF - This is a big boy. Each sip of this syrupy brew is like a bite of food. Very heavy body, carbonation level is medium but suitable for this. Probably best to drink this one on its own. You won't have much room for food otherwise.\n\nOmmegang really delivered on this one. Will definitely get it again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: I believe this appears to be the quintessential Quadruple Ale. Deep amber liquid with a creamy yellowish head that tames down to a thin foam layer with nice lace on the glass.\nSmell and Taste: Roasted malts and cherries.\nFeel: 9.7% ABV is a perfect setting for this brew. Leans toward the high end on the carbonation scale but it's not overbearing.\nOverall: Got to stick with the taste grade on this one. A very good Quad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy prune juice color producing 1.5 inches of tightly bubbled, very short-lived, light tan head that leaves little lace. Aroma is vinous with notes of cherry, caramel malt, brown sugar, something medicinal and a hint of alcohol. Taste is cherry tarts, plum, caramel, yeast bread, dark fruits and red wine with the medicinal note heaviest in the sweet, almost syrupy finish. Alcohol spice and warmth throughout. Complex, strongly flavored and heavy bodied with low carbonation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2021-06-13\n16oz can served in a big snifter. Gift from a friend. Best By 110921. Not sure, but may have been canned on 110920. \n\nPours a dark amber brown with a medium to small sized head, not much carbonation. Smell is dates, cherries, yeast, a little booze.\n\nTaste is Belgian dubbel/quad...dates/raisins, yeast, maybe a hint of molasses, with a little bit of unsweetened cherry juice added to it. Yeasty for sure, maybe a little hay or grain husk.\n\nMouthfeel is medium, maybe even lighter. Overall, it's interesting and not bad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev An old classic. Haven't had this in years... but how did I manage to avoid reviewing it a decade a ago? 750mL cork-and-cage topped bottle served in a Chimay chalice. Beer is deeply hued brown and forms a thick chestnut head which gradually falls. Aroma is intruiging with cherry, oak, and the distinct twang of Belgian yeast.\n\nFlavor has an immediate fruity taste of kriek. Sweet red cherries, but also raisins and brown sugar. Complimented exquisitely by dark malt flavors, bread and treacle. The mouthfeel is outstanding, smooth and weighty, punched up more by the allspice and clove spicy flavors than carbonation.\n\nOut of all of Ommegang's mainstay beers, I'm probably most likely to pass over this one because I'm so rarely in the mood for a cherry beer. But that doesn't detract one bit from how delicious it is.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV is 9.8%. Hazy dark brown colour, moderate off-white head with an orangey hue. Unusual aroma of cellar, preserved cherries / cherry pits, marzipan and oak. Warming mouthfeel. The fairly sweet flavour has notes of malts, cherry pits, marzipan and oak."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev been holding on to this one for a while now, been finding the right excuse to have it, and i was ireland lose to belgium in the football, i decided now was as good a time as ever to have this most legendary of beers, a beer like this can never live up to its reputation, but to be fair it is damn nice, it has a complexity to it that the other two great belgian quads (sb12 and tr10) dont have so much, black bread, dark chocolate, and raisins and plum combined with almost saison-esque leathery flavours, oaky, earthy, little bit of vanilla, spice, liquorice, medium bitterness on the finish, delicate body with high levels of carbonation, little bit of warming from the alcohol, dryness on the finish, fruity flavours and spice linger, maybe not the best beer in the world, but it really is quite good, an essential for any beer enthusiast, glad i finally got to try it",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bought by appointment at the monastery, a crate each of 12, 8 and blonde. The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.\n\nWhile I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated &quot;12.10.24&quot; which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the &quot;best by&quot; date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated &quot;19.01.14&quot; which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the &quot;best by&quot; date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.\n\nAPPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.\n\nSMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.\n\nTASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.\n\nPALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.\n\nOVERALL: to me this is not the &quot;best beer in the world&quot;, it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.\n\nLook 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4\n\nAPPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.\n\nSMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.\n\nTASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.\n\nPALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.\n\nOVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Received as part of NBW BIF #13 and just now getting to it. BB date was 12/22 so I am guessing it was about 4 years old.\nPoured the color of cold brew coffee and sports a manilla color head which leaves copious lacing.\nThe aroma was stone fruit and malts, I tried to find spices but failed. Still, excellent aroma.\nThe taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.\nThe feel was very good, way too easy to drink. I expected something more viscous but this really works.\nOA, excellent beer and so glad I got to try it!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I don’t know how old the bottle is, but purchased relatively recently and shipped from Belgium to me in Chicago. First off I think this is the coolest bottle I’ve ever had. Who else could get away with no label?! I don’t get a ton off of the nose, but I can tell it’s a quad and I’m liking it. It’s a gorgeous looking beer when poured too. It has an impressive full mouthfeel with the perfect carbonation. There’s a bit of a tart dry finish that I really like as well. Overall this is worth the hype and I hope the style doesn’t lose its popularity anytime soon.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Even looking at the no label bottle with the engraved circle is somewhat imposing. This one had rested for about 5 years. It poured a dark plum to prune color with still a good level of carbonation. The aroma was wonderful stone fruit. The complex character was true to form as still to me the best beer in the world. It made the perfect Thanksgiving beer and made me appreciate the good things in the world. Cheers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.\n\nThe aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.\n\nOn the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.\n\nThe body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.\n\nDrinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.\n\nOverall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm not gonna get all fucking scientific or anything... I won't be describing 20 different fruits, tastes or 20 different feelings... it's just a good beer! The taste of alcohol doesn't smack your ass down hard at all... it just happens to be perfectly balanced and that's it... St. Bernardus or Rochefort will hit you straight in the face... I can't taste the plums, cherries, orange peels and shit... all I can taste is a strong ass beer that has been done right... take it or leave it...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: it looks like it's a light brown, with touches of orange, it LOOKS like light should be able to penetrate through it, but it absolutely does not\n\nSmell: wet, damp wheat, heavy fruits, raisin bread\n\nTaste: figs, figs, and figs. dates, a very moist cinnamon, fruit, and raisin cake, brown sugar, wood\n\nFeel: smooth, a bit of heat, suprising as everyone says you can't detect the alcohol at all\n\nOverall: the big question: is it the best beer ever? not as far as I can tell. it is fantastic, but it does have a bit of alcohol tang/bitterness/heat. a fantastic quad, but i'd probably take st. bernadus most days, especially because it's so much easier to get (this bottle was $39.99). no regrets, happy to cross it off the list, but i won't be seeking it out...unless I'm in belgium",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I am lucky that I live in a acceptable range to get the Westvleteren 12 bottles. \nI always drink this beer after work or after cycling and I don't eat any sugar drinks or food before so I will taste it maximum.\nThis is for me the best tasting beer in the world.\nSmell and taste is 5!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Obviously the product of divine intervention.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Out of the bottle at Westvletern, Belgium.\n\nIt has happened: man has landed on the moon, Lindbergh flew around the world, and Raul has finally had Westvleteren 12. It feels like I have committed a crime but won’t be caught. Something unearthly is happening here… Like Shawn Kemp using a rubber or something.\n\nI’m gone and I may not want to be found.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Usually I blind-taste beers but I've read so much about this one over the years I certainly know of it's reputation. That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer? \nThis is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed... \nL- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. +10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down. \nS- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.\nT- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.\nF- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.\nO- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once...\nReview/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! \n330ml bottle BB: [xx]-01-2026 Euro16-00 Bought from [xx shop]/Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London. The xx's being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele!\n\nPoured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.\n\nThe wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had this in Aruba …. Reputedly best beer in the world at the time. It was damn good…. Best beer in the world good?… it was good…. Not worth the 30-50 bucks I paid for it though",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev P: Deep light brown. Large head which half dissipates \n\nA: Never much. Slight bread and a sweetness. \n\nT: Sweet bread. Raisins. Melted Molasses\n\nM: A little thin, but thickens up at the smooth as shit. backend. As it warms fills out and where the good stuff happens. Sweet brown carmalized sugar. \n\nO: Always a great beer and a pleasure to drink. It’s hard to compete with a classic Belgian style with all the specialty malt usage nowadays. Will be forever be a great beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing. \nBig light brown head\nDark brown/ruby color.\nFruity smell\nSweet, floral taste true to the style",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Took me about three years to get a six pac into my cellar. Fortunately, I have relatives who fly to Belgium once every 4 years or so. I'm down to my last 2 remaining . \nRead a lot about it, finally got it in hand and it was and is quite glorious. I like almost all of it , just the ABV is a real kicker. \nLook is superb, the head is quick to dissipate, scent is complex and rich, sweeter than I thought. \nFlavour is rich and deep and changes pretty dramatically as it warms. Lot of figs and molasses, I think they might have currants and apricots in there too. \nNice to sip and say these are some of the great moments in life. It's a rarity and should be enjoyed. Bucket list is to go to the Abbey and maybe go for 3 glasses on tap and taxi back to the hotel, drunk and happy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev was lucky enough to have this in Bruges. A fine beer, but I may have set my expectations too high to enjoy fully.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (2015 vintage) I'm not a lover of the dark fruits character that tends to result in aged dark beers but that's what i got. Suffice to say, the taste was the most mellow that I've ever experienced. Like a fine wine, it did keep some of its Belgian Quad character and it was outstanding.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev After waiting for many years to try this beer, it was very good but not the best quadrupel I've ever had. It has some nice dark fruit (fig, date, raisin) notes but it's surprisingly boozy. I no longer feel a need to acquire a case for aging purposes."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background. \n\nIt tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.\n\nThe mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.\n\nOverall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Backlog",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Coming back to this after a long time... A real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-IPA, though I know this was a cross between a DIPA and an Old Ale. Back when DIPAs first arrived on the scene, many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up Barleywine or Old Ale. If I close my eyes it feels like I'm back in 1999-- in a good way. Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). Hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad I revisited this classic.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Worth the price\n\nPours golden amber with thick suds. \n\nSmells like like oak barrel. Clean and sweet.\n\nTastes like a creamy dream. Can't even taste the 10% abv and that's a fact. Most oak barrel aged stuff is a bit cloying but this has perfect balance. After taste of spicy vanilla that leaves you wanting just 1 more sip. Superb.\n\nExtremely excellent brew! Lots of love goes into this force of nature. \n\nExpensive but damn this is worth it. Dogfish Head is still a top tier company and this one proves it like a MF.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 4/1/17\n\nCopper color. Left the sediment in the bottle. Khaki whit me head. \n\nEverything I was hoping for. Malts and faded hops and oak all around. Caramel, toffee, bready malts, floral and citrus notes, vanilla, oak... this beer has it all. Love the grapefruit citrus. Not bitter or sticky, just smooth and easy drinking for 10%.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 3/1/19\n\nPours a mildly hazy copper/orange with 2+ fingers of fluffy off whit head, tons of lacing\n\nA lot of subtlety in the nose, but right off the bat I pickup citrus, specifically orange zest, a light vanilla and caramel malt. Very complex in aroma, I'm guessing the flavor will be the same\n\nYep, I was right. Complex, but balanced between a biting hop and sweet malt. I pick up the oak notes clearly, it plays off the more bitter hops really well. The vanilla is in your face on the finish, with a mild citrus aftertaste\n\nGentle carbonation leads to a medium-full bodied brew. Finishes sweet and soft, wouldn't guess 10%\n\nI've been on a good streak lately with a lot of beers that I'm loving and this one is no different! Not sure I could drink a lot of it, but I'll come back to this every now and then",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Such a unique and delicious beer. Smells about as good as a beer is able to. So smooth and complex. I hope they never stop making this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This has been sitting in the fridge since I bought it in August as I waitd for some cold weather. Pours a brigt amber with heavy rotation orange tining. Head is thin but steady. Nose is wood and mint and vanila. \n\nThis is velvety in texture right off the bat, and while the flavors are rich and luxurious, they are also, for the style, subtle as hell. The primary flavors are caramel malt doused in oak and vanilla with peppermint, dark fruit, and black pepper in reserve. The texture is thick in the sip but there are very few other signs of high abv. This is an exquisite rarity. I am generally not a huge DFH fan and find them talented but inconsistent and overpriced.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My 2000th review on a beautiful autumn afternoon.\nBottle. 10/08/2019. Ebony in colour with a thick dense, tan head. Continuous lacing is apparent.\nRich, sweet aroma of maple syrup, bourbon, lightly toasted wholemeal bread and chocolate.\nFlavours intermingle. Vanilla appears with a touch of oak. Sweet at the front and medium bitter at the back.\nViscous and boozy feel.\nDeserves the accolades.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My first taste of CBS was two years ago when I had one from that years bottling. I wasn't blown away, as the sweet maple flavor came across as too strong. Later, I tried a bottle that was over a year old, and then was blown away. So I decided to now give this one a true review. Bottled 10/9/2019, poured into a snifter. Great stout appearance, with inky black color and tan lacing that settles into a consistent ring around the glass. Smell is of mocha, coffee and maple, with light bourbon. A great blend of aromas. Lovely taste that balances all of the aroma components. The bourbon is just right in that doesnt dominate the other tastes. Mouthfeel is typical of a first rate stout. Im glad I gave CBS another try, as the extra aging in the bottle IMO represents, at least to my taste, the beer with a World Class rating",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev You can see why this is a top rated brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Too sweet. Overrated."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 10/22/21\n\nLast but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer\n\nPours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing\n\nWow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum\n\nIt is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin\n\nA medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it\n\nThis is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2011 on tap in 2021\nLook - shocked how good this looks for being 10 years old. Thick reddish brown with a great white head and lacing\nSmell - tart cherry and woody \nTaste - fantastic tart cherries and a ton of wood \nFeel - medium body creamy with a slight carb\nOvearll - just a wonderful beer and shocked its this good after 10 yeras",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a brown color with tinges of red on the edges, all underneath a light tan head that evaporates quickly. The nose is loads of tart cherries, caramel, and some Brett. Wow.\n\nThe tart cherries and Brett are forward on the taste, with the caramel at the back of the palate for balance. This is the most delicious wild ale I’ve ever tasted.\n\nThe mouthfeel is medium and a bit spritzy. For me, this is a world class beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1679\nSupplication\nRussian River Brewing\nDate: 21 November 2019\nI will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. \nWhen I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness. \nThe beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness. \nThe mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish. \nThis beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Gift from Ti. 375 ml bottle, cork &amp; cage. Pours reddish brown with a small off white head. Aroma: Brett, white wine. Taste: Brett, white wine, apple, stone fruit, black pepper. Excellent sour.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a dark nutty brown with mild fog. Head is a finger and a half of tan foam that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is cherry, Pinot noir, with a earthy, bready malts and stone and cellar notes. Flavor profile is cherry with stone, cellar, Pinot noir, berry, and bready malts. Mouth feel is bubbly and effervescent with a medium thickness. Overall, big depth with a little sour zing and a sweet wine pop. Well aged, considering this was bottled March 12, 2019, and reviewed/consumed on May 22, 2021. \n\nServed in a stemless wine glass from a 375mL bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. &quot;Limit 2/customer&quot; a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right? \n\nServed chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food &amp; chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other &quot;specialty beers&quot; and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable. (Not a pro in the slightest and this is my 1st review, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I just had to put in my 2 cents because this is truly amazing.)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from cellar temp on 3/7/2021 bottle dare 8/25/2015 \n\nPours a reddish amber with a cream colored head that leaves a ring of lacing. \n\nNose of red wine, subtle candied cherry, caramel, mild grain, mild oxidation. \n\nTaste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer. \n\nFeel is light with light carb and lingers on the pallet for medium length. \n\nOverall, this beer has held up incredibly well. Balance between candied cherry, and the pinot barrels is excellent. There is some oxidation, but do not think it is making this beer worse, but adds to the complexity.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: A deep reddish-orange hue.\nSmell/Taste: The taste and smell are exactly what one would hope for in a wild ale. Some fantastic cherry sour taste and aroma, with the aged pinot and oak barrels providing some deep complexity\nFeel: Some carbonation, but not too overpowering. \nOverall: This is one of my all time favorites. I had tried a number of wild ales before, but this is the on that got me hooked. Absolutely, a tremendous beer"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. Notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. Very bitter aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My favorite IPA.\nBig grapefruit up front.\nAlcohol is well hidden.\nA great citrusy beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazed, amber/gold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing. Subtle aroma; coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango. Hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet, malty backbone. Lush aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle pours a glowing amber-copper color, nice thick head, leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass. Strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma. Full bodied but carbonated , Strong citrus flavors, nice lasting bitterness, very tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 10 month old bottle",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a bottle into a tulip.\n\nPours slightly hazy dark gold with excellent smooth foamy head that lingers well for the ABV and good lacing.\n\nThe aromas are more floral than pungent, with some good earthy aromas as well. Evocative of an old school over the pond IPA, rather than a piney American. But as the brew warms, pungent resins start to bloom.\n\nThe brew has a nice balance. A solid but delicate clean malt backbone offset with an ample earthy/floral hop flavor. Hints of honey, citrus, and graham in midstream. The brew finishes with growing resin and chive and some warming booze.\n\nThe mouthfeel is actually a shade beyond medium, and grows heavier as the brew warms, but the carbonation and leaning alcohol keep things in check.\n\nOverall, a really good DIPA that combines a lot of different hop feels. Although it gets a little all over the place and unfocused as the brew warms.",

A bit hazy.\n\nAroma of orange, pine, grapefruit, floral.\n\nStrong taste of pine, grapefruit, orange, a bit of pineapple. Resiny.\n\nMedium to full bodied, heavy carbonation.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One more drink before I hit the &quot;hard stuff&quot; for New Years...\n\n...and what a good choice I have made. Great looking orange-yellow brew with frothy, thick head. Great lacing all the way down the pint glass. The smell was full of citrus and the mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of decent carbonation. The taste is mostly what you will find when you take in an imperial IPA and overall, it's solid enough.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 7/7/13: Pours an opaque deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, foamy, short-lived head that leaves motes and a small webby ring of lace. Aroma is grapefruit, orange and caramel malt backed by pine and melon. Taste is intense grapefruit with notes of orange, pine resin,tropical fruits, melon and caramel. Starts sweet with bitterness entering at mid-sip and becoming predominant in the finish and aggressively so in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation, creamy, silky, a little oily in the finish and slightly chewy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of grapefruit and spice. Taste is sweet and boozy. Good mouth feel. Creamy, easy drinking.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Lightly hazed gold with four fingers of bone color head. Very dense lacings.\nSmell is malty with grapefruit hops.\nTaste is malt forward with good grapefruit pine slightly dank hops.\nMouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. The finish is dry and pretty balanced. \nOverall a tasty dipa. Bottled 06/19/19. The hops have most likely faded a bit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle dated 6.21.19. Michigan craft pint.\n\nA: pours a bright copper gold with 1/2 finger white head that fades quickly to a nice thin cap of bubbles. A few streams of carbonation flowing up.\n\nS: smells as you would expect it to: pungent citrus and floral hop notes, with a big, bold malt backbone. I know this beer is three months old and has been stored off refrigeration, but it is still a pretty potent hop bomb. The floral note to the hops is reminiscent of 3 Floyds’ Alpha King, Brewdog’s 5AM Saint, and Land Grant’s Goon. \n\nT: super sweet and citrusy arrival, big malty sweet citrus middle with a pine resin and slightly boozy finish. This is less of a tongue scraper than Green Flash West Coast IPA, similar to Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster.\n\nM: hefty, but not heavy. Moderately carbonated. \n\nO: a pretty standard, sweet, hefty, traditional profile DIPA. Very nice when I want a hop wallop, but I’m just so seldom in the mood for these high alcohol beers anymore. I like it and would certainly buy again. Let it be noted that mine was an old bottle; I’d probably score a fresh one higher."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev For some reason I thought I had rated this one years ago. Apparently not.\n\nPours extremely dark brown, nearly black, with a nice fluffy cola head. Good lacing.\n\nAromas of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, licorice, and some yeast.\n\nThe flavors follow the nose and that's just fine. Dark and semi-sweet chocolate, dark coffee, vanilla, licorice, buttermilk and dark fruit (cherry) sourness, astringent roastiness at the finish.\n\nMedium bodied. Incredibly drinkable for such a dark brew, owing to plenty of carbonation and a fairly drying finish.\n\nAre there better American Porters? Sure. But at this price point and availability level? Nope. Wanna show someone the difference between a stout and a porter? This might be the perfect brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good American porter! Flavors: coffee, chocolate, slightly sweet. Would drink again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2/11/22 Pitch black with a nice tan head. Roasted / burnt malt carries the day here. Some light coffee bitterness. Low ABV. Well balanced. Will add to the rotation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into my spiegelau stout glass.\n\nIt looks like Guinness (co2) on the pour which I'd say is a good thing. Those big beers usually seem to be pretty good looking. 1.5 finger head that fades to a decent covering of head. Almost pitch black but at the bottom of the glass you can see it's a dark brow color where some light can get through.\n\nSmell is full and quite strong with some rosty malts shining through, but there is quite a bit of fermentation character here, mostly just the smell of ale yeast bit it is quite strong. Not a lot more going on here but it's very malt forward and seems quite strong.\n\nOn my first sip it's quite dry and decently bitter. Once again some of those roasty malts are hanging in the back. Quite a lot of that ale character is up front. Slight tartness coming from fermentation as well it seems. Not a british flavor here, but despite the american yeast, hops arent all that present here. Maybe some for bittering cause it has a higher ibu than a porter or stout from the UK, but it seems to be a very malt forward american porter. Good but could be a bit more balanced. As I drink the bitterness becomes less pronounced and the malts shine more and more.\n\nFeel is quite smooth and creamy, not a lot of carbonation bit but it's there. Easy to put down but still rich like chocolate. Could be dangerous if it was less pricey but I like it.\n\nOverall a decent day porter. I wish there was a bit more sweetness from the malt but that's just taste. It does seem a bit dry for a porter but the roasty dark malts shine nicely here.",

Excellent lacing, but rather poor head retention.\nS - Funny enough, bubblegum is present and fairly upfront. Turbinado sugar and molasses follow closely, with hints of dark wheat and cacao.\nT - Bauernbrot and slight bubblegum fade into a deep baker's chocolate and creamy ristretto espresso. Bittersweet and well-balanced. The finish is a bright molasses and French-roast coffee with chicory.\nF - Creamy and easy-to-drink. Filling. Full-bodied with very light carbonation.\nO - A great campfire beer! A complex (but not too complex) entry-level porter that's easy on the wallet. This is now one of my favorite brews. I highly recommend this, and will purchase a six-pack if I can find it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of those days where one (very sub-par) beer wasn't enough. No real head formed as it went into the glass. The weak (or maybe my sense of smell is going today) scent was of root beer, Bazooka bubble gum (do they still make that anymore) with a touch of citrus. It was definitely dark, though more molasses than black and almost as opaque. A buttery feel in the mouth followed by some carbonation as it slid down my throat. In between, a slightly smoky, cherry coffee? I guess... that's my story and I'm sticking to it. The aftertaste is a bit like bitter coffee dregs with a little too much sweet'n'low. 0 for 2 tonight and I'm out of beer and it is past beer's bedtime in the stores.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Solid black appearance.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I prefer Carton and Ballast Point over this porter which feels thin to me.\nIf you're gonna add to your beers, you need to fine-tune the recipe so all play well together, such is my experience with Ballast Point, San Diego, and Carton, Atlantic Highlands, as this Marlin is outstanding every day sweet chocolate porter. \na) less head, retention and lace than a solid porter or stout.\ns) Malt, toast, char, and hops. \nt) Follows the aroma, a bit of cold-brew coffee up front, a touch of vanilla and some hop bite on the exit. Flavor is best part.\nf) Silky, but thin.\no) Deserves a blind taste test in a batch of mid-weight porters and stouts.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A perfect porter. Robust. Tasty. Not so over the top or sweet. Just right.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very dark brown opaque brew with about one finger of foamy tan head that shrinks quickly to a light skin but leaves some decent lacing all the way down. \n\nThe aroma is sweet dark malt with notes of coffee, chocolate and plums. \n\nThe taste is chocolate malt with plum or banana notes and a nice, slightly bitter coffee note to cut the sweetness, nicely balanced. \n\nThe body is a nice smooth medium and very drinkable. \n\nPorters are not my favorite style but this one is good enough to make me rethink.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a 12oz. bottle that I gently poured into a 20oz weizen glass. This porter is dark brown, very hard for me to see into. The head is a one finger deep tan. The foam settled back to a thick cap, leaving some lacing left behind. \nThe aroma is sweet chocolate malt and roasted coffee.\nThe flavor is sweet chocolate and dry roasted coffee with a the light bitter finish that helps cut the sweetness very nicely. To me the coffee dominates the taste. The dry, slightly bitter coffee notes cut the sweet chocolate flavors nicely.\nThe feel is very smooth, the carbonation is a non factor. This Porter is so good, I am thinking about having my third bottle while doing this review!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I moved from Colorado back to my home town in Idaho and I was spoiled while living in Colorado which had VERY diverse import beer selections and my favorite was Kumbacher Monschof Shwarzbier from Germany. But now that I am back home looking for similar dark beer with a malty flavor and low in bitter hops - Deschutes Black Butte Porter hit the spot and has a GREAT FLAVOR and AFTER TASTE. I am not a fan of the mass produced light but bitter over-carbonated pale ales so common in America Buying more if this !",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Possibly one of the best porters you can find. Black Butte isn't overpoweringly bitter. The notes play well together in perfect balance."

I served this to myself in one of those weird sour glasses and it works. I get people roasting this for calling it basic but that's the thing it is basic but this actually decently crafted. The variants I had to me not so much",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Deep amber in color with a massive, coarse, and quite persistent tan head. Scattered, patchy lacing adorns the glass walls. Before a strong light at the thinnest part of the glass, some slight ruby highlights can be seen. \n\nAroma: Strong notes of bourbon, coffee, bitter cocoa, vinous alcohol, molasses and caramel dominate the aroma. There are also notes of wood; the alcohol is quite spicy.\n\nTaste: The taste begins with notes of molasses, caramel, coffee, bitter cocoa, bourbon, dark fruit, spicy alcohol. As the taste progresses, the wood and bourbon notes firm a solid undercurrent to the taste, advancing as the taste progresses, as well as bitter cocoa. The alcohol produces a moderate and pleasant warming sensation. The taste concludes with a modest and lingering wave of bourbon and wood.\n\nMouth feel: Fairly full and soft, with only modest carbonation.\n\nDrinkabilty/notes: Really quite nice, and a fitting toast to the New Year of 2022. Would pair admirably with rich chocolate desserts.\n\nPresentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle, served in a snifter glass. Bottled on 09/30/21 09:26. \n\nAppearance: Pitch black, light tan dense head. Some strands and sheets of lacing which dissipated very slowly. \n\nSmell: Vanilla, light oak, bourbon. \n\nTaste: Well blended chocolate, coffee, bourbon, roasted malt. Nothing really stands out among the flavors. All are mild and well blended together. \n\nMouthfeel: Nice thickness, quite warming from the higher ABV, even though it's not harsh or that noticeable. Dry finish. Very light carbonation. \n\nOverall / Drinkability: A very subtle/smooth barrel aged stout. There is some bourbon barrel character, but it's mixed in with all the other flavors. A good sipping beer - quite drinkable. Would pair well with some desserts, and maybe a few other main courses as well. Quite nice and I wouldn't mind having it again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev dated bottle pours pitch black, with a decent tan head that crashes fairly quick, no lacing after 1/4 down...smells prett good, the bourbon barrel smell is dominant, and the taste is pretty boring. sweetness, and more sweetness, and slight booziness. some char/roastiness, and well, that's it. Too fuckin sweet and simplistic for the high price . Very over rated. Not bad, just not as good as the rating is here on this place. Won't get anymore, Narwhal is better...this is just too damn sweet , thin, and simple for the price/rating. Pass.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Dark brown to black, big head.\n\nSmell: Chocolate, wood, vanilla, booze.\n\nTaste: Sweet chocolate, then moderate barrel-wood flavor. Sweet throughout, with a somewhat light feel for the ABV.\n\nOverall: Another classic that I've finally got around to reviewing. I've had Dragon's Milk at beerfests and bars, but never reviewed. It's a very good beer, maybe a slight step lower than some of the other heavyweights but still quite tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Given to me from a four-pack of bottles from a friend. Poured into a proper brandy snifter.\n\nL - Pitch black with a one-finger cream-colored head. Pours very thick, with delicate legs.\nS - Cacao is very upfront. Notes of leather, vanilla, and brown sugar.\nT - Vanilla and cacao are the stars here! Leads slowly into a deep toffee with bourbon and coffee notes. You can't really taste the 11%, but it gives off 11% vibes. Finish is a lingering bourbon and sweet chocolate.\nF - Silky, full-bodied, and with light - almost nitro-like - carbonation. It's strong for sure, but you can definitely handle another bottle.\nO - A well-done brew of the style. A must-try. The best lounge beer, provided you're in a leather chair and next to a warm fire! I will buy this so long as they keep making it. Again, well done!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I can smell the bourbon, sweet and wooden but the cocoa/coffee smell of stout dominates after the initial waft.\n\nSweet burnt sugars come through first. There are elements of chocolate, wood and liquor.\n\nIt has a medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The finish is sweet, then bitter and finally rests on a warm alcoholic sensation.\n\nOverall this is a very solid bourbon barrel aged stout. It's subtle and not too heavy. I give it a 5.2 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev What a wonderful blend of bourbon and chocolate. Near perfect blend and balanced. Really enjoyed this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This one is about as basic a Barrel Aged Stout can get and it’s available year round so some would expect less than this delivers. Drank at cellar temperature.\nThe appearance is really nice; dark with light brown head and lacing, ideal for the genre.\nThe aroma brings bourbon and chocolate and vanilla and malts; but in harmony, not competition. \nThe taste follows the nose with all of those scents making an appearance as flavors, nicely balanced.\nThis is one I think will have a permanent place in my cellar. Just always good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Color chocolate brown\nScent caramel chocolate malt, vanilla \nTaste- smooth with nice chocolate and vanilla notes.\nOverall nice easy to drink at 11%. Nice for a change",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev If you love the bourbon barrel style, this is the one you go home with when you’re sober. It delivers everything you want and makes you come back for more. Great color, taste and feel. An all-around great imperial stout. Never disappoints."

Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer. At the very tail end of the finish, there is a bit of coffee, on the palate.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wow, what do I say about &quot;Bomb!&quot;? I'm somewhat of an amateur, all I could focus on for this one was the overwhelming spiciness. Beyond that, I definitely taste the coffee and chocolate as the primary flavors. This flavor was very complex, which is why I gave it a 5. I strongly enjoy beers that are &quot;different,&quot; and this is nothing like I have ever tasted. Extremely interesting beer, this is about my 6th of the night, and at 13% ABV for this one, I'm pretty gone by now. If you enjoy &quot;different&quot; or &quot;unique&quot; beers this is for you.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really good stout!!!! I bought a 12 oz. bottle at Half Time Distributors in Poughkeepsie NY, mainly because I am collecting bottle caps from all 50 states and Oklahoma was a real &quot;find&quot;. I had no idea how really good this beer would be. Pours a totally dense black color with no light coming through. Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol &quot;bite&quot; as befits the high octane. An excellent stout, I would gladly drink this one again as long as I was not expected to function 100% afterwards!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just a perfect Stout. Amazing.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a pure black color with a creamy dark brown head of one finger after a hard pour. \n\nSmell is creamy with chocolate and mocha and vanilla. Not really toasty which is what I would have expected from this, but really like a candy bar. But this is not just a sugar bomb, it seems pleasantly sweet smelling, not cloyingly so. Not much in the way of pepper aroma.\n\nChocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream, slight coffee way in the back. Mocha throughout. Spicy note comes in at the very end, almost in the throat, as a slight sting after swallowing. Balanced. Not super complex, but what it does it does super well.\n\nIncredibly smooth. A real dessert beer for sure, but not sugary. It's like a quality fudge. I had high hopes for this one, and it didn't disappoint.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I can smell the cocoa and coffee but besides that I'm just getting sweet malts.\n\nI get a lot of chocolate flavors with an added coffee decadence.\n\nIt has a medium mouthfeel with just a little carbonation for something akin to velvet. It has a bitter finish that lasts a long time.\n\nWhile I'm not getting the complexities promised of vanilla and chilis this is so so delicious. It's so well balanced and I barely pick up the 12 abv. I give it a 5.8 out of 6. BOOM!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bought on a recommendation at Blackbeard's Crafts on Sawtelle, this one surprised me. Everything in it is subservient to the cacao-- the vanilla stands in for sugar, the coffee offers bitterness where the malty stout would itself refuse to. It does really remind you of a milkshake, but not quite because of any desserty cloying sweetness. It's the viscosity, the half-and-half mouthfeel that delivers the vanilla and cacao while somehow sneaking in a full 12 or 13 percent ABV when you can barely even register the burn. Mine poured into a snifter with no head and barely even the sound of fizziness, and on the nose it's pure dessert-- chocolate milk or devil's food cake. I try not to inhale too much as I drink it, because I want to catch the ancho chili and the beer in a way that the aroma doesn't carry. Usually, this is not my kind of thing-- I don't like foreign flavors as a dominant element, and I like for a fine food to carry more layers, or maybe more variance between its layers. &quot;Bomb!&quot;, instead, wields its complexity in a way that focuses your attention onto that single 65-percent-cacao sensory simulacrum, making you wonder how this is even beer. \n\nI wanted to finish by saying that I respect this beer but didn't plan to buy another. Unfortunately for me, this beer feels like a perfect match for some of my favorite domestic blue cheeses. Rogue Creamery's exquisite &quot;Caveman Blue&quot; sings in the same key as this stout, and I have no choice but to try them together."

Roast bitterness, char and burnt brown sugar up front; bittersweet dark chocolate, chocolate brownie batter; raisins; roast coffee as beer warms; star anis and molasses on backend. Medium full body, moderate minus carbonation; some warmth from 11.5% abv; dryish finish. Overall, layers of flavors, however, at almost one year old the char/bitterness is still strong with a long bitter linger; a tasty RIS, yet more bitter roast than I want…it would be interesting to see how this beer tastes in a few years.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev No more should be needed than one brown twelve ounce bottle poured into a clear pint glass. There's no head, no glass lacing, almost no aroma and it's one of the most transparent amber colors you'll ever see. There are vague taste references to yeast, malt, hops and alcohol, without any discernable hierarchy. There is some decent carbonation and it's blandly drinkable. Still, it's not worth the time, calories or expense, unless it's free. In that case, reread the other two reasons not to drink it.",

The drink of choice for the hooligan who steals traffic barrels after a dorm party.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev man, i totally love this beer. absolutely world class. bottled 4/7/21 consumed 5/9/21, so nice and fresh!\nL: drinking from the bottle - nice bottle\nS: pine, citrus. bit of sweetness. very inviting.\nT: delivers on the nose and then some! huge hop flavor. bitterness and sweetness together with gusto. \nF: rich, smooth. light carbonation.\nO: awesome. just awesome.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Vintage 2020: 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.6%. Copper colour, large to moderate white head. Distinct hoppy aroma, notes of pine, honey and orange marmalade. Rich mouthfeel. The flavour is medium sweet, distinct notes of pine needles, orange peel and grapefruit, also caramel and honey. Reasonably bitter finish.\n\n355 ml bottle, vintage 2013, BB date 31.05.2014, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 10.4%. Orange colour, slightly hazy. Large head, slightly off-white. Strong hoppy aroma, notes of orange marmalade and pine needles. Very sweet and very bitter flavour, fruity and piney hops galore, but the sweetness and bitterness are nearly too much for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12oz bottle dated 4/7/21 into a pint glass.\n\nPours a translucent brownish orange with about two and a half fingers of light tan head. Excellent retention and lacing.\n\nSmells of some citrus over-dominated by pine and resin.\n\nTaste is definitely on the pine side but also with a large amount of malty sweetness. Not surprising from a beer this big.\n\nDrinks quite smoothly though. Sticky. Alcohol and bitterness in aftertaste. Low carbonation.\n\nOverall, it's a nice beer but probably not a yearly revisit. Glad there's still breweries making beers this big in six packs at a reasonable price."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz can.\n\nThe look is a nice solid amber, crystal clear with lively carbonation and a one finger head. Dissipates over a minute to a thin covering. No lacing\n\nAroma is giving me strong malty lager vibes here. Very lager aroma maybe some hops here, but they are definitely a small amount of bittering only hops. Maybe a bit of off aroma, slight skunk even with the can, but it could be an older can.\n\nTaste leaves the off flavor right in the dust this is delicious. Right up front is amber lager similar to the aroma but it quickly goes into a weird ester-y altbier sort of thing and it's very interesting theres quite an evolution on this one despite seeming pretty basic when I got into it. Some hop bitterness on the very back end. Dont know what to really compare it to. But it's quite malty.\n\nFeel is nice and creamy big body in the mouth bit still very easy to put down. Its al.ost like a milkshake in texture but liquid and carbonated if you can catch my drift l. Probably not but it's good. All year.\n\nOverall a very interesting beer. I'm glad I got it. Not really comparable to any other style, but so easy to drink malty decadent lager ale wonderland, despite the cover (which your not supposed to judge by) only looking average at best.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I ordered a Fat Tire, but the bar was out and the bartender recommended Anchor Steam as a good alternative. I'm glad he did.\n\nLook - dark amber, nice head that lasted.\n\nSmell - malty with hints of sweetness\n\nTaste - really good. The malt shines with just the right amount of hops in the background\n\nFeel - Above average with moderate carbonation\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this and will order it again if I see it on a menu. I've never seen it in stores around me (southeast).",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug reveal a pretty colored beer. It's brightly copper-amber and rather translucent. The slightly off-white head is much larger than what should have been expected for a reasonably gentle pour of a chilled brew. Obviously, it's well carbonated. It smells fuller than most American adjunct lagers. The malt is easy to find and is quite pleasant. There's a note of hops, too, but they're playing second fiddle. The taste is also much more malty than hoppy, although it's not hoppiless. Overall, it has an earthy and slightly nutty flavor, with a hop bittering at the finish. Although pleasant, that's the only complexity of the taste. Ìt drinks more like a Kolsch than a lager. The mouthfeel is disappointing. With all that foamy head, it drinks surprisingly flat. It's like most of the carbon dioxide went into the head, leaving little left for the beer. The history of this beer is renowned, even by casual drinkers. But, the craft beer phenomenon has made this more of a tradition than a treat.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a slightly hazy orange amber from the can, light, creamy 1&quot; head with moderate retention but great lacing. Nose is sweet and bready with sticky malt, toffee, and light yeast notes; barley tea as it develops deeper on the palate. Taste has a very light malty sweetness balanced with enough bitter hop to indicate it is there. Mouthfeel is smooth with gentle carb. Overall, cooling and refreshing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Clear, copper color. Frothy, off white head with good retention\n\nAroma: Mostly herbal with some caramel malt note\n\nFlavor &amp; Aftertaste: Spicy &amp; herbal. Hints of mint. Moderate to mild bitterness.\n\nMouth feel; Full bodied. Medium length, clean finish.\n\nOverall: The first craft beer I ever drank. Can't believe it took me this long to right a review &amp; notes. It's full bodied. Presents herbal &amp; spicy hops aroma and flavors on a mostly sweet malt backbone. There is hint of mint. Moderate bitterness. Nice, easy drinker. More flavorful than typical American golden pilsners/lagers. Nice looking beer in the glass. Always a joy to revisit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is one of my all-time favorites. Not for any one thing but for the sum total that it is. It's not too heavy to drink a four or so and it's heavy enough to know you are not drinking watered down corn fermented corn juice which I detest. The hop amount is nigh on perfect for the masses yet enough for the aficionado who discerns the kind and type. They never need to change this one as it is the perfect high-quality everyman's brew. I say that but it does command a more premium price than a everyman's brew and in most areas is only available in sixers (i.e. no 12-packs and no cases which is a huge mistake). I have only one more thing to say and that is I would drink this happily if there were no other brews and that is in spite of the new yellow and blue labeling which sucks as the previous label was the absolute best in the who brewing business.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours amber. Mild carbonation and nucleation. Remarkably clear. \n\nS: Roasty toasty barley. Bready sweetness, and a touch of hops.\n\nT: Tangy and zangy, caramelized grain.\n\nF: Thick and bready flavor but it's rather lightweight. \n\nO: I would relate this to Shiner Bock or Okocim. It's rather nice. I'm going to read about it and see what they have to say, now.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Generally an underrated beer. Pours a crystal clear copper color with an off white head, the slight head from 12 oz bottle dissipating in a few minutes. A clean malty nose with a mild more English ale hop note. This beer has a wonderful malt and hop balance, Lightly carbonated, an enjoyable clean malty taste with a crisp bitterness, think northern brewer / Kent goldings, unique in style, with a total absence of the typical Cascade piney notes. Totally unique and the canonical steam beer, the mix of pale and caramel malts provide a very slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the level of bitterness. Very drinkable, a really lovely beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours a clear copper with a 2 finger off white foamy head. A beautiful looking beer. \nS: Malt\nT: Caramel malt upfront, light bitterness on the finish \nF: Crisp, medium bodied, drying finish \nO: This is the only California Common/ Steam Beer I’ve tried so I can’t compare it to anything. As a beer in general, it’s very good. It has the flavor of a beer in the 5.5-6% range. I will be buying again and again!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Steam Beer is my second favorite next to Anchor's California Lager.\n\nPours a nice golden amber/brown. Almost as dark as the bottle. Not too much of a head, may be the velvet-like smoothness of my pouring technique (*fingerguns*).\n\nAnyways...\n\nKind of an even malt/fruity hop aroma. Not much visible carbonation at all. \n\nTaste is un-f***ing-paralleled.\n\nThis is truly a work of art, just like their Cali Lager.\n\nIt's not bitter. It's not sweet.\n\nIt's just refreshing.\n\nIf you get a chance to try this beer, understand that it's of West Coast origin. You'll probably like this brew!\n\nI love this brew and would recommend this AND the California Lager. (Real similar, but still apples and oranges when comparing them both.)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fantastic summer beer here, had on-tap and enjoyed thoroughly; can't believe I've never reviewed this one before. Wonderful malty, mildly nutty and somewhat caramelly lead-in with a light, snappy grassy and earthy hop component that all blend beautifully into a clean and crisp body and finish that doesn't carry a trace of lager-y skunk. Recommended.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I find it difficult to write a normal review about appearance, aroma, etc, when it is about such a classic such as Anchor Steam. In how many reviews are words like amber or malty repeated that they become numb to the reader? Does it taste as good today as it did 40 years ago? Hell, I don't know, Perceptions can change from day-to-day let alone decade-to-decade. But it's still enjoyable.\n\nJust let me say it is still unique, still a legacy, still delicious and I still respect it immensely after so many years of imbibing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Nice amber color, with ½ to 1 finger off white frothy foam. Reduces to basically nothing in a few minutes. \nClear. Very nice carbonation. \nAroma: Get a nice nose of malt and some yeast. Bites at your nose a little bit.\nTaste: Piney hops and a little grassy flavor.\nMouth Feel: I was getting a light medium feel for this. Very nice carbonation.\nOver All: This was a nice refreshing beer."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really fantastic. One of the most refreshing IPAs. Ballast Point has a super great flavor developed here with awesome balance. Not too bitter but definitely hoppy enough you know you’re into an IPA",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a light amber. Thick foam. Mild grapefruit aroma. Big bitter grapefruit body. Bitterness persists. Could use a little sweetness at the end. Average at best.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 3/10/21\n\nAs mentioned in my Sculpin review (last night), this was also one of the first beers that got me into the craft scene. Thusly, I never got around to actually reviewing it. At the time I just knew that I liked it, but couldn't articulate what about it I liked. Finally, 3 years later it's getting an actual review. Let's dive right in\n\nPours a cloudy amber gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nObviously some hops can give off a pithy grapefruit character, but it's easy to tell that it's just straight up grapefruit used in this one. I'm picking up on aromas of fresh ruby grapefruit, bready malt, white pepper, earthy hops, and light pineapple\n\nIn the OG, the aroma is far superior to the taste. Here, they meet in the middle and equalize, matching each others intensity. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, sweeter grapefruit juice, grassy hops, bready malt, and light lemon. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, orange rind, bready malt and light pine\n\nA light medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet biting beer. Finishes mostly dry without much sweetness\n\nIt's good, great even. But it doesn't match the smoothness of the original. Definitely a worthy variant and it stands on its own as a good beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been some years since I had this as one of my neighbors gave me a can he purchased in Cincinnati. For a few years after Sculpin was widely available locally, but now I rarely see it. In any case, it had the great hop bitterness of regular Sculpin -- with grapefruit on top. I liked it, but have not sought it out.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Obviously very citrussy scent with the sweetness of a little malt.\n\nThe taste is almost exclusively bitter which is good and then the grapefruit and some bready malts.\n\nIt's thin with moderate carbonation.  The finish is actually both bready and a little citrus.\n\nOverall it's a very solid IPA.  I give it a 4.9 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Have seen this around forever and bought a six. Not impressed. Has a nice puffy head and plenty of lace, but it tastes like grapefruit peel and is more bitter than anything else. Won't be buying again....",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev For a fresh pack im kind of disappointed. Feel is great there is definitely a grapefruit taste so that's a win but the hops don't come through as much taste wise. The overall feel is great though.\n\nUpping the taste a little bit as since this is a variation the grapefruit should be the featured flavor and I did get it",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev First off this is definitely my favorite grapefruit beer of all time..Its been awhile since I've seen it on the shelves but it just showed up at my local hipster, labodega, gourmet beer store so I was enticed to pick up a can. ..\n\nThe date shows that it's only a month and a half old which is game on for an ipa, and I've had it in the past so it was like running into an old friend that your actually happy to see..\n\nI poured this beauty into my speigelau IPA glass and got a perfect 2 finger head with a slight carmelized note and a pure strong grapefruit scent like no-other beer I've ever experienced...\n\nLike I said before, best grapefruit beer on the market period!!! And at a solid 7% abv you can't go wrong!!! HOMERUN!!!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I have had this beer from draft, bottle, and can. By far the draft is the most fresh of course, but all versions are enjoyable.\n\nLook: Clear and light golden in color with a decently long lasting two fingers of white head\n\nSmell: Immediately can smell the grapefruit notes up front, otherwise is just nice and fresh smelling\n\nTaste: Again, up front is initially strong notes of grapefruit and floral fading to the more hoppy IPA, not too bitter though\n\nFeel: Easy to drink, not too heavy nor too rich, good amount of carbonation\n\nOverall: This is a solid go to IPA that is further improved upon by the grapefruit aspect. Perfect for a summer afternoon",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can. Can bottom is stamped 'PKG 15MAR21'.\nClear, deep gold colored body. One thin finger of white head. Leaves behind spots and trails of lacing.\nAroma of citrus (lots of grapefruit) and piney hops, with a sweeter malt base. When the nose is taken away from the glass, the grapefruit is picked up again.\nTaste is grapefruit citrus, resin, and piney hops. Good honey malt base. The hops yield a classic bitterness. The hops and some sweetness linger into the aftertaste.\nJust about medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation. Very clean in expression.\nReally a solid example of the West Coast IPA, and the grapefruit adds positively to the bitterness angle. This remains a classic beer recipe.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 12oz can into a glass.\nA: Pours golden yellow with a very slight haze. Holds a thin 1/8&quot; white head.\nS: Fruit. Grapefruit of course, but also a hint of over ripe tropicals. Hint of dankness.\nT: Grapefruit juice bitterness upfront, some malt sweetness and then it finishes with citrus pith bitterness.\nM: Body is somewhere between light and medium.\nO: So refreshing! The grapefruit is well balanced within. Well done. Actually the only fruit infused beer that I would buy again and again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pours a slightly hazy deep near-amber gold body with an off white (near burnt cream) fluffy foam head that has moderately low retention and leaves no lacing as it dissipates completely within 10 odd minutes. \n\nthe aroma is deep lush earthy grapefruit and a dash of pine\n\ntaste follows the nose. there is a sizeable hop bitterness hit, but just beyond this is a wonderfully lush grapefruit bite. \n\nmoderate carbonation and medium bodied mouthfeel. smooth with a dry finish and an earthy bitter aftertaste",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice grapefruit smell upon pouring. Clear gold color without rising carbonation bubbles visible in my glass. 1 finger of head with some good lacing but the head is not long lived. Taste follows nose, with a fair amount of hop bitterness. Nice mouthfeel/ clean with mild carbonation. Overall a dependable offering that I often use as a benchmark to calibrate my judgment of other IPAs. Not the best IPA but consistently solid."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I really liked this beer, but I also thought the bitterness really overshadows the wheat character. It's pretty much an IPA with a bit of wheat smoothness. Nevertheless good and refreshing.",

But it did smell nice.\nThe taste, really quite good. Bit hoppier than I expected but not annoyingly so. Made for a nice bitter end to the flavors of malts and hops and wheat that style is known for. Quite refreshing actually.\nThe feel is nice for the genre, goes with the crushability. (Is that a word?)\nOA, Oberon finally has a challenger. This is one tasty and refreshing beer."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Very very dark brown, but ruby red up to the light. Off-white to cola head with a bit of spotted lacing and average retention. \n\nNose: Nutty, coffee and toffee. Lightly roasted coffee beans, brown sugar and some chocolate at the end. \n\nTaste: Creamy but a little bit dry upfront. Not as malty as I assumed it would be. It is slightly dry and a bit like sucking on a lightly toasted coffee bean. Astringent throughout. I get an unpleasant bitterness from the hops. So much so that I switched glasses halfway through to make sure it wasn't my glass. My eyes and my nose wanted this to taste a certain way, but my mouth said otherwise. Mouthfeel is nice, but a tad watery. \n\nNotes: I was excited for this one as Dogfish usually hits it out of the park (in my opinion). I think the hops being added to what should be a bit maltier brew throws this one off. It's a great idea, but doesn't know what it wants to be.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A hybrid of 2 of my favorite beers (IPA and Brown Ale) Also has a scotch ale in there as well, so I had to give it a try . I've heard amazing things about it. Head is a dark red color. Smell some chocolate and caramel and a little fruit as well. Taste definitely was good. Right off the bat you taste some cocoa, a little nutty, and some coffee hints. What shines through is you taste some hops, not West Coast IPA strength or even NE IPA strenght , but just enough to give this a little bite, more so than your typical brown ale. Mouthfeel is light, definitely tastes lighter than it's 7.2 ABV. It's definitely a solid beer, a little slightly overrated in my opinion but definitely solid. If you like Brown Ale's and IPA's it's a must try."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Like Agassi swinging a racket - waboom! To hell with the Nadal’s and Federers. This is old school goodness! Like Kate Moss on the cat walk, gimme gimme! Ok! Raul is gone!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light color, very refreshing taste. Slightly sweet on the backend. Reminds me of a less sweet Leffe Blonde.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clearer than I remember, displaying burnt gold under a short bubbly white head, which is impressive in a wide mouthed Chimay glass. The head settles unevenly, leaving thick spongy lace, \n\nHaving this just after a Duvel chalice, this becomes easier to translate as a more amped up version. It's got a little more spice, toast, heat, and booze. Each characteristic. Yet in a way, it's still balanced, as there's nothing too clovey, and there's none of that damned banana. It's more toasted wheat and zucchini bread.\n\nThe medium body has a firm froth and finishes warmingly and satisfyingly semi-dry, exhaling pear peel."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Old school DIPA from Three Floyd’s. I’ve been so happy since we’ve started getting tons of their beers, including the barrel aged bottles. I love getting to drink these reasonably priced old school IPAs. This one pours a clear dark gold, with aroma of citrus, tastes slightly bitter, a bit of malt sweetness making the taste almost of lemons and oranges mixed together. Great west coast DIPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev So I'm updating from my 2013 rating. I gave it a 4.5 then. This probably isn't a good comparison.\nI stopped by Glendale Liquors on Rt. 27 in South Brunswick and saw Dreadnaught, and didn't even give any thought to the $18/4pack price. Until sitting here looking at reviews and warming up on a Nugget Nectar, I never even thought to check the date. But I saw a review that says 3F have discontinued this beer. So I looked. I can barely make it out, but there it is, &quot;Pkgd on 2/14/21.&quot;\nApparently, Glendale charged me $18/4 for a year old beer. Shame on me for trusting them. But lets see how it is aged. At 9.4% ABV, its got to retain something, though I don't expect it to be hops.\nSo it looks like a fine NE IPA...dirty blonde color with a good head, so hazy, its opaque...I'm trying to remember if its unfiltered? Do they do that in Indiana?\nAge has definitely impacted the nose. I'm getting a moderately sweet, breadyness with no trace of pine or citrus. \nAge hasn't been kind to the flavor, either. mostly that barleywineish sweetness with bitterness around the edges. Mouthfeel is still very chewy and quite lovely. But I won't add ratings to waterdown what I gave before. \nBut after a year, i'd give it 4.25, 3, 2.5, 4.25, 3.25.\nAnd a warning to doublecheck the dates when you think you found something good at Glendale Liquors on Rt 27!!!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I am usually more an APA drinker with the occasional gem of an IPA. My last was Pliny the Elder. I was not expecting to reminisce of it from 3 Floyds, and from a $4.99 4-pack, no less.\n\nA refreshing looking amber hue with candied pine on the nose. A burst of citrus ages to tropical fruit over a few seconds, then a pop of pepper and a grapefruit finish. It finishes with strong herbal notes that never overpower. A light, creamy orange washes over the palate soon after.\n\nJust an absolute pleasure. I've been a big fan of 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust, but found their other variations much more of the same. Dreadnaught was expected to disappoint. I wondered why it was the last pack on the rack. I wonder no longer. World-Class, indeed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours a translucent golden color with a large fluffy head that ends up as lots of lacing.\n\nInitially smells of slightly dank piney hops. A warmer glass adds grapefruit and pine apple.\n\nTastes of piney hops with sweet malt upfront with citrus and pineapple coming out as my glass got warmer. It has a slightly bitter and boozy finish.\n\nThis is a not overly assertive west coast IPA with some sweeter nuances and a punch. \n\nMedium body with light carbonation. Light dry mouthfeel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 2/15/21, so 4 months old.\n\nLooks outstanding in the glass. Clear pale amber body with a massive cream colored head. This slowly dissipates to a collar and solid covering, leaving layers of lacing.\n\nNot much of an aroma here, not that I have much of a nose. A little musty fruit.\n\nOn tasting, a strong sweet malty wave washes through the mouth. Just when you start to think &quot;malt bomb?&quot;, the palate is attacked by a pine/resin/grapefruit assault. Like 2 beers in one. Me liking this.\n\nMouth closer to full than medium, finish pine citrus bitterness.\n\nOverall, just an outstanding old school dipa. Would love to compare this 4 month old can with one fresh off the line. Holds up extremely well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1549\nContinuing with Three Floyds Beer, Dreadnaught is next. The last Pale ale was tasty, looking forward to this one. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered off-white head. The head is airy, foamy, and creamy with excellent retention. The dissipation left chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 8, amber yellow with orange hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with a few yeast floaties. A stellar presentation for the beer.\n\nI first detect pine, grapefruit, floral esters, and resin. Next, I smell biscuits, lemons, a touch of passion fruit, wet grass, phenols, caramel, and a hint of dankness. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are floral esters, resin, pine needles, lemons, pineapple, fruity esters, phenols, oranges, caramel, a wee bit of toffee, malty sweetness, grapefruit, herbal, and a hint of pharmaceutical. \nThe mouthfeel of the beer is warming, astringent, and tannic. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish. \n\nThis is a perfect example of Imperial IPA. The hop profile is extraordinary. The malt backbone is firm but not overbearing. It reminds me of Ruination, but better. I am enjoying this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This, I think, is my first rating in NINE years. (I've done a lot in the intervening time on Untappd, but BA will always have a soft spot for me.)\n\nSo, as I understand it, FFF is no long producing this beer. I bought it recently for a mere $9 from a local shop. It was bottled April 2018.\n\nI first had this beer a good 20-odd years back. This sample reminded me how incredible FFF is. Although this has citrus and mango fruits in the mix, at 3+ years, those fruits have ceded to the malts, pine and...a nice, dry finish.\n\nI need to get back to that local beer shop and my the remaining stock of these big berthas. I think they had 5 or 6 remaining and in a fridge.\n\nGonna miss it when it's gone, but enjoying it now immediately transports me back 20 years. Ahhhh...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev -orange-amber can pour with a slight haze and a sticky foam cap. \nThe aroma is of pine and orange. \nThe flavor is resinous with orange marmalade prominent and melon included. \nThe mouthfeel is full with moderate to high hop bitterness persisting in the finish. \nThis brew brings a “game-on” feel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev **\n05/08/21\n\ncan to snifter.\n\nLOOK: medium hazy, big creamy cream colored head. excellent retenion.\n\nAROMA: pine, hay orange rind, \n\nTASTE: citrus and pine, hint of sweetness upfront with a tasty bitter finish, \n\nFEEL: medium body and creamy; well balanced. \n\nVery good. I was thinking that despite this beers reputation that it was not up my alley, but it is quite tasty and enjoyable. Great balance. Zombie Dust on Steroids.\n\n**",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pours clear copper color, white foamy head, decent lacing\n\naroma is malty and citrus as orange and grapefruit, slight pine\n\ntaste is malt up front and citrus and resin though the back\n\nmouthfeel is sticky but not sweet, medium carbonation finishes astringent with a bit of an alcohol burn\n\noverall it's an old school IPA, nice balance of malt and hops, super easy to drink and hides the 9.4 abv well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The pour is orange. The taste is citrus hops, mild grapefruit, &amp; some hop bitterness. This was not bad, the 9.4% abv was masked well. Cheers! A-",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a hop and malt bomb. Very crushable @ 9.4%. Fortunately, I resisted the urge to have a 3rd one after the first 2 went down so easily. \n\nFirst time for Dreadnaught as 3 Floyds recently hit MA and RI a bit after. I love Tree House and there is no logical reason this beer shouldn't be rated as high as some of their top beers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: slightly hazy bronze color with some yellow at the bottom and burnt orange at the top. Nice 3.5 finger rocky off-white head\n\nS: sweet caramel, mango and candied apricot. Strawberries, grass, and an earthy dankness. Sweet grapefruit , and some sweet berries. Tons of oranges, some crackery malts \n\nM: fuller side of medium, slightly sticky. Moderate carbonation\n\nO: this is a very nice DIPA. Old school with its balance of malts and hops. Worthy of its high score - I think it is",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I continue my quest to count and review The Beers Of Fame. (I'm at 166, but who is counting?)\nOf course, I haven't had Dreadnaught until now because I shy from IPAs and particularly Imperials.\n\nDreadnaught Looks luxurious. Smells take me back to eating an orange in a pine forest in Olympic National Park. Tastes are close to balanced; until the finish that is too bitter for this malt-head's buds. In the mouth, malty and luxurious... until the bitter imbeds. Yet, even refreshing to me.\n\nI've had only 15 from 3 Floyds, which is is not many from a master brewer started in the 1990s who is just across the border. But my admission of being a malt-head helps explain why only two of those brews I rate above the average. So there must be something else. Perhaps it's the slug: &quot;It's not normal.&quot; I like to think I'm normal (even tho I deep-down doubt I am.) But there is always something unknown about 3 Floyds, like some unspoken family oddness. While we all got that, I suspect 3 Floyds is telling the truth and truly is not normal. What does this have to do with beer? I dunno. I'm just trying to explore what is in my head and what my bittered buds tell me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - hazy orange with 2-finger foamy, off-white head. Good lacing.\nS - bready malt, slight citrus and pine notes. \nT - sticky pine and hoppy. Bitter.\nF - medium mouthfeel with semi-dry finish.\nO - good beer. Hides the alcohol well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Copper amber color with a 4F head in a Spielgelau IPA glass.\nPiney aroma.\nThe pine and some citrus continues to the taste.\nPiney, sticky MF, with a hoppy finish.\nExcellent beer. Best served at 50°.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: A slightly deeper gold with a thick white head and a decent amount of lacing for this upwards of 9% DIPA.\nAroma: Hops and malts vigorously fight to be showcased, but hops have the slight edge. Candied citrus, grapefruit, pine, caramel, brown sugar, marmalade, pleasant yeast, baked bread.\nTaste: Everything in the nose blended together for an absolute home run of an Old School DIPA.\nFeel: Medium carbonation - bitterness and sweetness come in waves after the finish. \nOverall: One of my new favorite DIPAs. Especially for you old school IPA fanatics, this will not disappoint.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sticky icky. Wonderful resinous, piney, lightly syrupy character. 9+% sneaks up on you and soon after you've cracked three, you're having such a wonderful afternoon nap. \n\n3Floyds rarely disappoints. Aside from flooding the market with Zombie cans (which truly are half as good as the bottles), they just make dang good ales. Dreadnaught is a star amongst them."

Dough is at the end.\nF: Light bodied, well carbonated crisp &amp; clean mouthfeel with a brisk, fast finish. It is not drying.\nO: Overall a simple, tasty AAL that is crisp and clean.

Small white head shrinks to a covering, but leaves good lacing early on. \n\nSlightly sweet aroma.\n\nOn tasting, well, there isn't much. Smooth, clean, quite sweet. The ibu of 10 is just wishful thinking, no bitterness of hop prescence at all. Then again, no unpleasant flavors either.\n\nMouth above medium, finish clean and sweet.\n\nOverall, not the horror I was anticipating. The sweetness wears on you after the first 8 ounces.

Still a marvelous, refreshing citrusy, hoppy joy. 750 ml bottles that work in a Weiss beer glass. There is a tang to this that is hard to describe but is akin to the unique characters of a Weiss beer.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1529\n\nMy continuing quest for the best has to lead me to this beer. I had to get this beer shipped to me, living in a beer desert it hard to get good beer. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A beautiful two-fingered bright white foamy and creamy head was formed. The retention of the head is excellent. Lacing was created on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with loads of carbonation bubbles. \n\nI first get spicy hops, a touch of floral, malty sweetness, wet grass, and orange peel. Nosing further, I detect coriander, wheat, and phenolic.\n\nThe flavors in the beer are orange peels, floral esters, ginger, coriander, phenolic, lightly toasted malts, and malty sweetness akin to honey. The flavors kind of remind me of Belgium pale ale with a splash of Heff. It does have a light funk factor nothing I really could detect. \n\nThe mouthfeel is crisp, effervescent, and creamy. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium, high carbonation, and a medium finish. \n\nThis beer is stellar. The flavor complements each other well and the malt profile is there but not overbearing. The hops are subtle but firm giving away to the spice addition in the beer. If I could get this beer, it would be a staple in my beer fridge.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had a few beers from this brewery always with great results.\nGolden amber color. Scent and taste of orange, ginger and slight banana.\nOverall very impressive beer. Will look for more of the beer soon",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Upon opening the glass, it is billowing out of the bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy (~40%), medium golden/orange color that has sediment floating around in it. A strong white head. SRM of 9-10. (4.00)\n\nAroma: Moderate aromas of bread and cracker malts upfront. This follows into a banana and clove ester quality. A bit of banana bread and Belgian spice. Some juicyfruit, but ultimately it smells malty. (3.75)\n\nFlavor: The flavor follows with more bready malts upfront. Cracker, bread, and then follows into a Belgian spices of clove and banana. This linger and provides a tart and spicy pepper astringency before it finishes with a sweet, almost candied malt finish. (3.75)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finishes soft on the palate. \n\nCompared to Boulevard's Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale 4/16/21: Pours a more orange color with a milder head. More bready, clove, and banana malts. Less fruit, citrus, coriander, and yeast. Winner: Tank 7\n\nOverall: A pretty good farmhouse ale/sasion. I wanted to see how this one compared to one of my favorite saisons, which is Tank 7. I think I prefer the Tank 7. This is a decent beer, but as other have mentioned its leans more malty, bready, and sweet. The clove, banana, and pepper spice show here. Overall, not as good as I expected, and drinks pretty average. (Final Rating: 3.79)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle with Best By date 07/03/22 \nAh.... one of my first beer-loves, back in ancient times, c. December '97. Somehow I haven't reviewed it , &amp; have to admit, slightly intimidated to do it now. How to do it justice? Will the &quot;objective #s measure up to my overall impression of it? Hmmmm??? OK, here goes : \n\nTranslucent gold-ish orange, with a huge forever head , that leaves a thick ring , substantial surface covering, and sheets of lacing . (Or it would, if I could hold off on drinking for a few more minutes - trust me - that's what happens. ;) ) \n\nSmell ? Nectar-Of -The-Gods, if you like that sort of thing. ;) . The usual banana, clove, &quot;spicy&quot; [ coriander+black pepper+ je ne sais quoi yeast aroma ], with a touch of &quot;fresh&quot; [wheat-derived, mostly] aroma, that usually accompanies saisons, goses, &amp; Berliners. Just better than the usual. \n\nTaste is similar to aroma, sort of, with elements of [very] ripe banana, black pepper, clove, coriander, 2-day-old homemade bread crust, a vague, very faint citrus element, a kiss of sweetness, and that ~indescribable (by me) , signature Ommegang yeast flavor . Some mild, mildy-drying bitterness.\n\nFeel is light-medium, but give the impression of substantial presence, while also floating-on-air, just above eye level. Moderate, moderately-soft , carbonation tingle that extennnnnnnnnndddddddssss for quite awhile , before disappearing, &amp; leaving the front pof the tongue a bit dry, &amp; slightly stripped. \n\nOverall, as you might guess, I am astounded &amp; enthralled all over again. If anything, this might be a bit TOOOOO fresh , &amp; could use 3-4 more months on it. If memory serves, I'd give the &quot;Taste&quot; rating another +.25, in that ideal state. ('Course, that might just have been the abv X [#beers] being the voices in my head. ;) In any event, if you haven't tried this, please, do yourself a favor, &amp; go for it. (&amp; for Dog's sake, don't drink it ice-cold - let it warm up to 45-50F , or so. :) )",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a thick white head. Funky aromas. Sharp carbonation and medium to heavy bodied. There’s a good saison flavor under there, but it’s masked a bit by the coriander and ginger. Maybe it’s just a personal flavor preference, but these flavors just don’t quite seem to go with the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stem glass.\nStrong 2-finger head when poured. Some decent lacing on the glass and nice lingering thin head on beer while drinking it down.\nStrong copper color filled with carbonation bubbling to the top to keep that thin head going.\nCoriander and spice right away invite you to take a drink.\nSparkling mouthfeel as soon as you take a drink and that smooths out at the end.\nAs described on Omegang's website, you can taste the coriander, spice, and orange peel for a really delightful beer drinking experience.\nOverall, this is everything you want in a 'traditional' Saison- I fell in love with everything Omegang brewed years ago when Belgian beers became popular. It's so nice to revisit an old friend and put up a review on ba. I strongly recommend this beer any time of the year. I can't wait to try Omegang's newer offerings!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer has a beautiful, rich taste on poor. It has a succulent, foamy head with a light amber color. The aroma is not all that apparent. However, the taste is really good. It's crisp and refreshing, especially during a pandemic on a hot, humid day in DUMBO, Brooklyn. I don't smell or taste much in the way of orange peel or the coriander. However, the coriander taste is subtle but clearly there. This beer is refreshing. Even with a 6.5% ABV it's not heavy.

Warming elicits notes of wheat as well as bubblegum and banana courtesy of the yeast. Barnyard funk is muted at best. Medium body and fine carbonation makes for a lively, luscious mouthfeel that's just right.\n\nOverall, this a fine beer. While it lacks some of the nuanced flavors that often typify the style, it has no glaring weaknesses to speak of.",

Received from @JayORear in an LIF from NBW BIF #14.\nPoured honey color amber and quite transparent, capped with a short near white head and active carbonation continues throughout.\nThe aroma was mild for me; but my nose id damaged from chemical foolishness (Really, when a liquid recommends that you use a respirator when using it, USE a frickin' respirator!) \nThe taste was a surprise. Russian River IPA, WC all the way, right? It's like they took a page from Bell's Two Hearted and balanced the malts in with the hops. That piney dominance I expected wasn't there, but it existed in harmony with other flavors; floral, doughy, herbal, etc. Not what i expected but still really tasty.\nThe feel? With the active carbonation, this checked all the boxes in the regards to feel.\nOA, one I've been wanting to try a long time and finally got the chance. It's not what I expected but it's really good in an unexpected way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear darker gold beautiful creamy dense white head, great lacing and retention. \n\nAroma is grassy hops, grapefruit and orange, and peach candies. \n\nTaste is grassy, grapefruit, and some pine sap; a subtle soft sweet malt presence. \n\nMedium body, smooth feel, nice and bitter; linger hoppy aftertaste",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pint at Toronado in SF. Stellar IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Pig, bottled 122321, pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a thick dense head and BIG bubbles of carbonation. If there's a better smelling American IPA, I haven't smelled it yet. Floral and fruity it smells awesome. Tastes fabulous. Floral and fruity, slightly citrus the hops are perfection. WOW! So impressive. Mouthfeel is perfection. The lingering hop bitterness is absolutely righteous. Overall this is what IPA dreams are made of. The hops are just extraordinary in this wonderful blend. I may have to upgrade my Overall opinion when I have my second beer. &quot;...and the crowd cried for more.&quot; My Extreme Thanks to @RaulMondesi for sharing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle from Whole Foods in Del Monte Center, Monterey, CA. Pours a clear light gold with a finger of rocky white head that sticks around, decent lacing, smell is candied citrus, mild pine resin, soft caramel, doughy brioche, taste is citrusy orange soda, pulpy orange juice, pine, mildly bitter herbal pine and citrus pith on the finish that lingers, feel is medium bodied, crisp carbonation, medium carbonic bite. An excellent balanced IPA with nice malt and bitter hop balance, a citrus and pine treat.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very bright and citrusy nose with a slight pine. Very nice bite with a quick hit of pine and ending with a citrusy bitterness. Kinda the opposite of Pliny which I found to be more pine dank aftertaste. Its definitely the younger brother of pliny but its still amazing. Definitely has the same elements in it just not as much. Would definitely buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drank 16 days after “bottled on” date. Piney, citrus aroma. Pours straw color with thick lacy white head. Flavor follows aroma, dry, piney, citrus bitter.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My new rating after losing my old profile f/10+ yrs ago. The Pig has lost its piney, citrus flavor. Its my go to beer regardless but it has lost that pig flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Expectations were high, this one turned out to be just average plus for me. Smooth drinking ipa style that now seems a bit dated with hazy mainstream.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 17.25 oz bottle into my new Kevin Malone rastal. \nBottled on 8/11/21. \nThanks to Donald for this surprise box!\n\nMostly clear gold but with a little chill haze, and a classic west coast head; bone white at 2 fingers, leaving gorgeous lace destroying the glass as it recedes gradually. \n\nAroma brings forward slight papery oxidation, with slight onion skin, dusty pine flooring, grapefruit rind, and dead hop leaves. I do not detect any yeast, malt, or ethanol in this beer. It is cutting and dirty and bitter smelling. It's a change from what I'm used to, but also brings me back to when IPAs were all emulating the giants like RR. \n\nFlavor doesn't hit until about mid-palate. When that happens it brings sawdust first, then a little evergreen, then some onion skin, a tiny presence of crisp caramel malt, and then some papery oxidation. After you swallow it however, the flavor really shines. It sticks to your tongue and cheeks and roof, and sucks all moisture out. Then, seemingly suddenly, a wave of resiny bitterness and sweet honey take over and the oils take hold, pounding your palate with lupulin gland again and again. The finish is literally 10x as long as the beer itself, and takes time to dry on your palate. Then a whole new world opens up.\n\nFeel is resiny, oily, very carbonated, with no alcohol anywhere in sight. Palate punisher, this one, as the oils destroy and scrub every taste bud from your mouth. \n\nOverall, an impressive one to be sure, and it's easy to write paragraphs about it. This is one that should be in the books (and probably is), right along side its cousin Pliny, and has every right to be studied and emulated. This is a true west coast IPA in every sense of the word. \n\nExemplary.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks literally exactly the same as Pliny the Elder (had them side by side): beautiful, crystal-clear, light-amber-gold, with a big and pillowy head of bright white bubbles. Lots of splotches and streaks of lacing down the glass. Great looking beer. After that, the experience is very much like a muted and somewhat watered-down Pliny — some nice notes and well-crafted, but not really a standout. Piney, bright, citrusy, with solid bitterness, a lot of grassiness, some soapiness, and a touch of malt-sweetness. West Coast IPA all the way, with heavy grapefruit, but boarding on APA (for me) in terms of aroma and taste profile.\n\nCrisp and refreshing but not particularly noteworthy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had on tap at Stone World Bistro Gardens in San Diego. Pretty medium gold hue, nice head, well carbonated, smells of hops and citrus. The taste is good bitterness with a decent malt backbone, dry, crisp, a nice melange of fruity notes and extremely well balanced and crafted. It’s “only” 6.25 but a pint before and after dinner was all I needed to get my happy buzz on. A wonderful example of a West Coast IPA and I strongly recommend to all hopheads, cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle purchased in Alpine, CA; born on 06/23/21. Pours light yellow with one fingers worth of head. Foam slowly recedes with nice lacing. Sweet flora smell with lighter hop bitterness. Very good beer... very good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear gold, with a sticky eggshell white head. Very good retention, tons of lacing.\n\nAroma of yellow grapefruit, honey, white bread, juice pineapple, and white pepper.\n\nHuge flavors of pineapple, lemon zest, yellow grapefruit, grass, honey, crackers, and white pepper. Tart and juicy pineapple/lemon/grapefruit upfront, cracker/honey in the middle, and then grass/pepper on the finish. Crisp and clean, very dry for an IPA, with a slight lingering bitterness of grapefruit/lemon peel, white pepper, and faint pine.\n\nMedium-light feel, well carbonated, snappy and dry.\n\nA fantastic dry WCIPA. Highly recommended.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 510ml bottle into an IPA glass.\n\nLook- Frothy white head, slightly hazy, small particulate sediment, straw, very active carbonation, above average head retention, average lacing.\n\nSmell- Pine resin, citrus, vibrant bouquet.\n\nTaste- Pine resin, slight citrus, very mild bread flavor at finish, great balance.\n\nFeel- Thin body, high bitterness, above average carbonation, prickly, very astringent finish.\n\nOverall- Wonderful West Coast IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look - poured into a tulip glass from a 510ml bottle. Fully transparent, straw yellow in color, with a two finger head that somewhat dissipates. Plenty of lacing left behind.\n\nSmell - pine, citrus, some dankiness, and a bit of tropical/candied fruits. very old school west coast style smelling.\n\nTaste - a smooth citrus flavor first hits the tongue, which is immediately followed by moderate bitterness. a mix of citrus and tropical fruit flavors detected towards the middle, and the beer finishes with a fresh bite of hoppy bitterness and a slightly sweet finish. a 20 second journey of an experience.\n\nFeel - medium bodied, medium-high carbonation, and not too strong on booziness at 6.25%\n\nOverall - as one of Russian River's longstanding rotating offerings, this beer has all of the great aspects of a West Coast IPA, done as elegantly as anyone can. Pliny might be king, but to me, this one is just as up there.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Serving: 510 ml bottle (“bottled on: 051421”) poured into an stemless tulip glass.\n\nAppearance: Bright, clear golden yellow with a good froth of white head and spotty lace.\n\nSmell: Intense and enticing aromas of citrus zest, pine needles and pineapple, with a slightly spicy dank close.\n\nTaste: Follows from the nose with plenty of bright citrus (lemon, orange and grapefruit), along with clean pine needles, subtle tropical fruit and a light malty body. Finish is decidedly crisp and pleasantly bitter.\n\nMouthfeel: Light to medium body, clean and crisp, with moderate carbonation.\n\nOverall: Classic West Coast style and flawless Russian River execution.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Crystal clear light orange with a quick-developing pure white head that explodes and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind\nAroma: The smell hit me while I poured it. Ruby red grapefruit, mandarins, pine, fir needles, strawberries, sweet malt, and a little dank – a phenomenal nose\nTaste: Follows the nose well. A huge citrus fruit punch out of the gate – grapefruit, orange, lemon-lime, etc. along with strong conifer notes to start. Malt stays present throughout but mainly in a supporting/balance role as this is all about the hops. Berries and dank intertwine and citrus fruits regain strength on the finish\nMouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and a nice medium-strong bite and an equal level of dryness on the finish\nOverall: Damn, this is good. I haven’t had (nor been able to have) this beer in years and in my opinion, the hype it gets is and has always been well-deserved. An awesome and well-made WCIPA that seemingly has no flaws. Add to that the balance, clarity/look, cleanliness in execution, and mouthfeel and its easy to see and taste why this is world class stuff. Highly recommended",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a nearly transparent golden color with a short lived head and some lacing. \n\nSmells of malt and hops with a bit of pineapple. \n\nTastes of hops with some pineapple and citrus undertones. It has a mildly bitter finish. \n\nMedium light body with light carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel. \n\nThe bomber I sampled was only 6 months old but may have had poor storage conditions. I was hoping for more from this brew. Now I will have to get another and give it another chance.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear straw golden with an awesome, fluffy head. The nose is light hops w/ floral and lemon. The flavor is tart w/ hops and a touch of pepper. Finish fades to pine."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fairly light head. Smell is sweet; banana and bubblegum, esters, coriander, cloves. Taste follows; sweet slightly caramel malt, banana, a hint of orange peel and citrus hops, becoming bubblegum and fruit esters, finishing with plenty of cloves and coriander. The alcohol is quite present; finish is dry. Not bad, but a bit too sweet and too reliant on the presence of spices for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev clear yellow with a short &amp; short lived head with a faint aroma of banana, clove, and candied orange peel\n\nMonkey tastes of banana, clove, candied orange peel, pear juice, with a peppery hit at the end.\n\nalmost no carbonation in the glass, but has a fizzy mouthful with a dry peppery, slightly bitter finish\n\nnot a bad tripel for the price",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Originally when I had my first Golden Monkey it was in a Victory mix pack. That mix pack had hop devil, prima pils, another victory beer I can't remember and golden monkey. I remember dreading having to drink Golden Monkey and would often split it with someone rather than waste it. The bottom line, I was out of touch with the world of Belgian style beers. Long story short, over time, Golden Monkey ascended to one of my favorite styles. This is a clean, spicy, and dry finish beer that leaves you with a warm happiness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Solid brew from victory",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by 5/17/23\n\nOh man, how the hell have I never reviewed this one? This was a big one that pulled me into craft before my legal drinking days. I would also wager that it was my first Belgian-esque beer, but I can’t say for sure. Enough talk, rime for a proper review of this classic\n\nPours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing\n\nThere’s not a whole lot going on in the nose, just a nice balance of spice and fruit. I’m picking up on aromas of clove, overripe banana, white pepper, orange rind, and bready malt\n\nThere’s a bit more going on in taste, and it’s a bit sweeter than the aroma especially on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, white pepper, grassy hops, crackery malt, banana, and light coriander. The swallow brings notes of candi sugar, toffee, clove, overripe banana, bready malt, apple skin, and orange rind\n\nA medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer with a bit of bite. Finishes neutral but a bit too sweet\n\nThis is a good beer, but after years it pales in comparison to other Tripels and Belgian beers in general. Still, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 5/5/21 - &quot;best by 5/5/23&quot;; drank 12/7/21 @ the Yarchives. \n\nSee-through (slightly cloudy) dull orange/yellow appearance. \n\nBanana, clove &amp; faint allspice notes in the nose. \n\nMedium thick mouthfeel, with a mild cinnamon bite on the lips. \n\nCaramel, apple cider &amp; clove flavors up front; faint cinnamon notes on the finish. \n\nGreat holiday beer; sweet, mildly spiced and flavorful. I'm a fan!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a translucent golden color with a foamy head that ends as a lot of lacing.\n\nSmells and tastes of bread, yeast , banana and clove spice with a slightly dank twist. The finish is slightly bitter with some alcohol warmth.\n\nMedium body with light carbonation. Lush mouthfeel with a clean dry finish.\n\nThis is an Americanized take on a European standard with a bit heavier body and darker danker hop taste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours a deep, cloudy gold color that looks almost like a fruit nectar. Has a short, cream head that dissipates fast, leaving small amounts of lacing.\nS: Smells of honey, yeast, spices, cloves, bananas, a bit boozey. \nT: Banana bread, honey, yeast, cloves, hops, with a strong bitter finish and alcohol. \nMF: Full bodied, earthy, has a punch to it. \nO: King of rough on me, it's good but it's a slow sipper, it's strong. Like a warm, honey wine, fireplace type of beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m not familiar with the style. Maybe I haven’t grown an appreciation for the finer things. Maybe this stuff is just awful. I was very excited to try it. Good reviews, good smell- terrible experience. Overtly bitter and unpleasant for my non-distinguished palate.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Always somewhat skeptical about American &quot;Belgian-Style&quot; beers, but Victory does a nice job with authenticity here. The bright, clear gold and solid white foam look good at first glance. The flavors donated by Belgian yeast are straight outta Brussels. Clove and banana crispness. My only slight beef was a couple sips got a little boozy during warming, but still the beer finished well. Legitimate!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev An outstanding example of a U.S.-brewed Belgian Tripel and an effortlessly drinkable. The high ABV is sneaky, too.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle with illegible date into a large snifter.\nL: Pours a deep lightly hazed bright gold with a tall, rocky, pillowy white head with good retention and solid carbonation. Some spotty lacing.\nS: Crusty crackery bread, earthy spices, honey, a hint of alcohol as the beer warms.\nT: Yellow sweet bread, banana, candied sugar, yeasty, nutmeg and coriander, earthy hops, orange rind, clove, wild flowers, a lightly bitter finish with a trace of alcohol.\nF: A firm medium-bodied wet mouthfeel with a slightly dry med-fast finish. It is vaporous in nature and a little bit sticky.\nO: A beautiful tasting Belgian style Tripel Ale that is warming and simultaneously refreshing and quenching. Absolutely brilliant with rich foods, garlic cream sauces, soft cheeses and herbed chicken. Simply great with many foods. It is excellent in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz. bottle poured into 20 oz. plastic cup\nLook: Straw color, 2 1/2 finger head that dissolved into thin layer, excellent carbonation.\nSmell: Spicy- clove?, hints of banana, florals. Pleasant.\nTaste: Peppery, mild hops, a touch of banana and medium bitterness\nFeel: Nice mouthfeel, taste coats tongue well\nOverall: My first time with this style and I enjoyed it. Reminded me of a more complex version of a lager (look and carbonation like a lager)\nPairs with citrus, mussels in butter, white fish, carrot soup or any place where you need to add some extra spice. Would be good with some poached pears as well. I'll bet it is good with banana bread.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours a deep golden with soapy white head. Lots of ripe banana and banana bread on the nose. There's some banana bread, some yeasty tanginess but there is a bitterness note that really disrupts the melody of this beer. It's kind of medicinal in nature. The feel is boozy and yes this is a boozy style. The body is light though. I think this is perfectly fine but I enjoy other tripels more.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This stuff is downright tasty. And I don't generally like hoppy beers. Fruity smell, flavorful, but not too sweet, light'sh taste. Minimal hoppy aftertaste. Goes really well with fish or a pizza with hot peppers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev this beer is pretty gross to be honest. Only reason I buy it is because it consistently comes in a 15 pack with 12 other victory beers that are actually quite good. It tastes too much of cloves and banana. I power through and drink this one first every time just to get it out of the way. If there's one thing it has going for it is that it has a high abv that is pretty masked behind all of the other bullshit. Out the fridge, I pop these in the freezer for like 30-45 minutes because I find it so much easier to drink when ice cold. Would never buy on its own, the taste is just too much; Definition of &quot;doing the most&quot;.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer is a little spicier than the normal Belgian-style tripel ale. It’s a nice change, but not one that I would have often / drink back-to-back.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drinking this at my local Harris Teeter Grocery Store Pub in Raleigh NC at Briar Creek.\nPoured from a tap into a pint glass\nAppears a golden yellow with a nice foamy white that dropped to a thick cap head and lacing.\nSmells cloves, banana, and yeasty.\nTaste follows the nose nicely, Belgian yeast with a plenty of spiciness and pepper on the back of the palate.\nMouth feel is medium plus for the style\nWith a nice creamy finish.\nOverall a very nice Belgian Trippel that I would definitely order again.\nCheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Suggested by a beer geek. Also suggested the sour. \nL- amber color\nS&amp;T- clove and I thought nutmeg but they are close spices. Flavor is trademark Belgian, like if you were in Belgium. I remember this taste in a Belgian restaurant in London years ago. The sweetness of the beer to complement the flavors make for a great beer \nO- I really liked this, I usually drink wine have almost 200 bottles in the house. But for 2 months now, I have a different beer almost every night. Had Alpha Abstraction #15, yesterday which I would made my top 5, this is good but not great"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown \nwith a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick fat layer with excellent\nlacing. Nose of dark cocoa, pine touched hops, dark coffee, and moderate char.\nFlavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa, char, coffee, and floral as\nwell as pine touched hops on the rear. Nice mouth feel; medium full body, smooth,\nlightly creamy, and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong\nhops. \n\nOverall, a solid brew, a touch more hops than I remember, but solid all the same!\n\nCheers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Victory Storm King is a well balanced stout, with elements of malt, roasted malt, and hoppy bitterness. The 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. The flavor is more assertive than a Guinness Stout Nitro. I recently tasted a Carlow O'Hara Stout that was more aggressively flavored than Storm King, even having half the alcohol content. All things being equal, I'd prefer to drink two of the O'Haras than just one Storm King.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours an opaque deep dark black with a creamy/foamy mocha colored head. Deep roasted nuttiness,almost peanut butter scent, Taste is smoky, coffee,espresso even more. dark chocolate.Feels full bodied with enough carbonation.Finishes dank and chewy- Overall this is a stout that lets you know its a stout, An above average hop presence.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age.\nreviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste. \nIts a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L- jet black tan head with moderate lacing\n\nS- herbal hops up front with a sweet roasted malt and vanilla back drop\n\nT- strong citrus and herbal hoppy flavors with some chocolate and char. Moderate to strong bitter.\n\nT- medium body, medium carbonation.\n\nO- well balanced very good beer. I would almost consider this a black IPA though",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours black with a nice light brown head. Not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists. \n\nCitrus hops, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roast black coffee. \n\nVery much similar to the nose, the hops really show a grapefruit citrus without any of the sweet. The coffee also really shows on the finish. \n\nFull body, moderate to low carbonation, a hint of alcohol, nice big bitterness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a near black color with a small short-lived tan head and light lacing.\n\nSmells and tastes of toasted malt and coffee. Sips are lightly bitter from start to finish.\n\nMedium body with light carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.\n\nThis is a good imperial stout that probably would mellow well with some age.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Looks dark brown to black with a khaki head that falls off to a thin cap. Smell is a nice mix of dark malt, roasted coffee, cocoa and a bit of bright floral hops. Taste starts with roast malt, a bit of fruit (raspberry), hops. In the middle I get some bitterness from the hops, more fruit, and a cocoa powder flavor. Finish is hoppy, cocoa powder, and coffee. Very balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is medium-full, rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, I'm glad they brought this back. For some reason I always passed this one up years ago. This is a great stout and a nice change of pace from the barrel aged and super sweet stouts that dominate.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very dark almost opaque, beautiful one inch that dissipated into a foam cap with lacing. Aroma of dark malts with hops. Taste is coffee, chocolate, roasted barley and finishes with pleasant hop bitterness. I have really missed this stout and the style it represents. This is definitely to savor and enjoy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Can’t go wrong with this brew",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is excellent. \n\nSmell: It has strong roasted aroma with citrus. There are some low expresso notes in the background. \n\nTaste: It has strong roast and coffee flavors with citrus notes integrated in the malts. There is very low pine and a hint of floral. \n\nFeel: It has a full body and slight alcohol warming. \n\nOverall, although this is more like a black IPA to me, it has great flavors and finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Draught 8oz snifter at The Brass Tap here in Baltimore: More hops than I normally care for, especially in a stout",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by 10/14/22\n\nSo this is one of those classic beers that everyone in the forums talks about quite often. All that talking must've done some good, because Victory decided to bring this one back for this year. My last beer to close out a wonderful Chirstmas I just had. Let's crack it open\n\nPours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nUpon first whiff of this, there's no question that this an old school Imperial Stout, just loaded with bitter roasty aromas. I'm picking up on aromas of charred toast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, acidic coffee, earthy hops, and light toffee\n\nOof, it's possibly even more roasty in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, bitter coffee, earthy hops, toffee, and light grapefruit rind. The swallow brings notes of char, caramel malt, toast, dark chocolate, herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and acidic coffee\n\nA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a roasty and bitter beer. Finishes mostly dry with a huge roast character\n\nThis beer is definitely a product of the time when it was popular, and it's pretty damn good for that. Drinks easy for what it is",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev So this stout is very interesting to me, since it uses European malts and American hops. I read some reviews about this stout that were much older, stating that it tasted more like a black IPA than a stout, but I disagree with this assessment. It tastes like a European imperial stout to me, with cocoa, slight coffee, a bit of bread, and a little bit of a hop bite, but really can't tell that the hops create any outstanding bitterness. Certainly not a thin beer, but certainly not the thickets beer I've ever had, and quite dry on the aftertaste.. I really enjoy it, but it's not as good when warm as some other thicker stouts. Overall, great stout, but better when served up slightly on the cold side. If you want something to drink at room temp, this probably isn't it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev l: 75% black, head is dense, off white\n\ns: fresh toast, \n\nt: fresh toast, a little burned, some coffee, \n\nf: medium body, velvety, balanced, chugging friendly\n\noverall: good quality stuff, not so much complexity as the aged ones but still taste great, and affordable",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nThe type of brown called to mind by an untamed forest, thick with brawny tree trunks, swallowed up in the darkness of its own, impermeable canopy; nightfall immersing it in sightless black. Oh, it has a head too… Right. Got a little carried away there. It’s a lush, wonderful head of pale, sandy froth with long-lived retention and lace that starts as a sheet, then breaks into cobwebs.\n\nBouquet:\nSmoked oats, coated in a chocolate that’s never even heard the word “sugar,” let alone mixed with it. The backend yields dark malts and miniscule, earthy hops, pulverized into powdery dryness.\n\nFeel:\nSo plush and thick, it’s like chewing on a satin quilt—but in this case, pretend the quilt is edible and chewing on it is not the result of mental derangement. A weave on low carbonation provides a bit of fiber-like contrast to the texture… Hmm, I’m not really selling you here, am I? Look, its good okay. Full bodied and smokier than a volcanic plume. Drink it and instantly gain +100 Manly Points.\n\nTaste:\nA billowing cloud of woodsmoke engulfs the palate, leaving the tongue to blindly trip over dark, earthy hops, bang its shins on blocks of raw cacao, and fall, gratefully, onto a pillow of soft oats at the end.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12oz bottle dated best by 10/7/22 into a pint glass.\n\nPours an opaque black with about two and a half fingers of tan head. Great retention, great lacing.\n\nSmells mainly of roasted/smoky malts with a hint of coffee and baker's chocolate.\n\nTaste is bitter dark chocolate with strong roasty/smoky notes. Touch of coffee in there too.\n\nMouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but still pretty full-bodied. This is a different kind of IS than the RISs I'm used to. Strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time. Low to medium carbonation.\n\nThis is really a decent beer. A little different than what I'm used to but a great change of pace. Glad Victory brought this one back.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Perfection incarnate for me. This is exceptional - seriously. I think one of my favorite beers has to be Alchemist's Luscious. I don't get up to VT more than once (maybe twice) a year. I have a couple stowed away to enjoy this holiday season from a summer trip - I love that stuff but this is so reminiscent. Stylistically, profile, aesthetic. It's quite a surprise for me. What I'm trying to say is, this to me fills the luscious void in a sense. Price point is excellent as well. Man, what a beer. Big, bold, bitter, luscious stuff. I suspect there's something of cascade in here - that hop just becomes what you need it to. I dunno, this is wonderful stuff though. Grab it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Jet black body with a finger of brown head.\nS: aromas of coffee, espresso, hazelnut, and roasted nuts \nT: big time coffee/espresso notes, followed by a nice hop finish with a touch of bitterness \nF: slightly creamy, medium body \nO: outstanding, underrated in my opinion",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pours a deep cola brown-near-black body with a tan foam head that has low retention and leaves occasional thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a thin murky cap with occasional thick bubbles and a thick defined halo\n\naroma is clear, thick and rich molasses sweetness with thin licorice herbal hop and mocha\n\ntaste is espresso with dark fruit underpinnings and that herbal licorice tinged hop; dark chocolate is kinda buried here but in there with the roasted malt; resinous pine underlying\n\nmouthfeel is somewhat thin bodied with robust carbonation; comes across like carbonated espresso with pillowy bitter prickles throughout and a dry, hopped finish with an herbal, licorice tinged hop and robust dark chocolate and espresso aftertaste\n\noverall:\nstraight up carbonated espresso beer. pretty great and somewhat complicated and tinged with resinous pine and lowkey herb. pretty great overall, but lacking balance",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’m not sure how this beer gets such a high rating. Ether I’m wrong and need to study beer more to understand it or everyone else is wrong. Or I can just simply have a different opinion which is probably the case. We will go with the last one I guess. I get nothing on the nose other than a slight burnt toast scent. The taste is of burnt soap or a semi cheep cup of coffee. Mouth feel seems non existent. I think Victory can do better than this by a long shot.\n\nAfter I wrote what I said above, I saw a comment below saying that it is more of a black lager and yes!!! That’s it!! The post even said if it is a black lager than it is a good black lager! This is indeed a wonderful black lager and not a stout. Shame they call it a stout. It is the hops that add too much of a bitterness for a stout without the maltiness, yet for a black lager it is perfect. \n\nStrange how names can make all the difference.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Imperial stout 9.1 abv with relatively high IBU at 65. This is a style of imperial stout I really enjoy, and it shares the heritage of North Coast's venerable Old Rasputin. Glad I found this one. Bought a 6-pack of 12-Oz bottles and went back for the case. In PA this one is $40 per case of 25 or $10.49/6-pack, and an exceptional deal. Appearance: Black, tan head, good lacing. Taste: Strong coffee, caramel, malts, balanced bitterness to offset the stout sweetness and clean finish. No alcohol heat or odor, so be careful with this one. It's a seasonal favorite.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev very solid offering from a stellar local brewery. rock on, victory! but, given all that, i feel like i enjoyed it more in the past. enjoy by 10/22, enjoyed 10/21.\nL: from the bottle and it has some style\nS: chocolate, coffee, hops. nice.\nT: it's good; maybe too much bakers chocolate for my liking. a little bit of sweetness woudl work better.\nF: bit light for the style. finishes with a lot of hop bitterness. balance lacking.\nO: ok, it's very good but somehow missing a bit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look...Jet black with a tan fully carbonated head. \nSmell...Roast coffee and a roasting smell, followed by hop. \nTaste...A sweet coffee of the front then a lingering coffee hop bite. RIS style. I can see why people say that it is similar to a black IPA. But the final sweet bitter is the stout style. \nFeel...not thick or viscous creamy. Black tea style fluidity. medium carbonation\nOverall...This ids definitely growing on me. I usually review after i have had more than 2 of them but...gotta break my own rules. This is very good and will be picking up some more before they run out,,,,,",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.1%. Pitch black colour, moderate tan head. Fine aroma with the expected roasty notes, coffee, dark chocolate and liquorice, hints of leather, blending in with the fruity notes of West Coast hops. Medium sweet flavour, roasty notes galore, strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice, again blending nicely with fruity hops. Bitter finish. A great beer!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a very creative beer. Rich in flavor, slight cherry (sour), caramel, figs, and vanilla.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Im sampling this 12 oz bottle at cellar temp poured into my snifter. This bottle is about 7 years old and has been in my cellar for most of its life. The beer pours black coffee color with no light passing through the glass. Very minimal tan head foams up and remains a thin edge layer throughout sampling. I leave maybe a ml in the bottle as there are some sediment chunks that Im not interested in.\nThe aroma is rich and complex malt profile. I get brown sugar, some vanilla, and rich woody notes. I also get a little booze and hints of port in the background. I also do get just a wisp of oxidation cardboard buried. glad I opened now and not next year!\nFirst sip reveals a medium body with mild yet still slightly tingly carbonation. Texture is definitely sticky and coats my lips and palate with each sip. Flavor is deep malt with brown sugar, some tobacco, dark cocoa powder, and wood. Finish actually also has a little dark fruit and some booze. No hop character anywhere and I dont get any oxidation on the flavor profile. I do find this to be a sipping beer due to the texture and slight booziness on the finish. Interesting and enjoyable, but I need to go back and get a fresh bottle to remind myself of what it tastes like without aging.",

Rich and semi-sweet. Strong oak and wood. Spice, a bit of smoke, earth, and toasted grains. Aromatics... vanilla, spice, coffee, and cocoa. Medium bodied... smooth and creamy. Warming... ABV hidden.\n\nO: An outstanding Imperial Brown ale... great flavor, and it really picks up the wood/smoke/aromatics. Hides its hefty ABV... unique and delicious stuff.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cask at the GBBF 2008, gravity dispense. Black colour, no head. Alcoholic but interesting aroma and flavour, notes of &quot;oak&quot; (actually palo santo wood), coffee and fortified wine. At 12% ABV this is powerful stuff. Good, but not easy drinking.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color, with a thin espresso colored head; has strong legs on the side of the glass. \nS: Boozy, vanilla, brown sugar, roasted, whisky barrel. \nT: Taste very much follows the nice, has a nice coffee-like bitterness as well, oak, dark chocolate. \nF: Full-bodied, light carbonation, chewy &amp; heavy, yet smooth on the finish. \nO: What is there even to complain about? A very well done brew, cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Instead of the strict five point review format, I'm just gonna tell it like it is.\n\nThis beer is and in-depth, syrupy mouthful of deliciousness, especially when comparing it to your average pint of not-nearly-as-heavy brown ale. I bought a 4 pack of bottles on a trip (bottled 10/09/20, drinking it on 1/8 and drinking it at whatever appropriate temperature for this type of beer, fuck fussing about degrees F) and it's an excellent beer. Very little noticeable carbonation and all of those dank, roasty, delicious flavors I love in a brown ale whether exceptionally heavy or as light as newcastle.\n\nFor sure, worth an excellent review in my eyes",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells like a sweet steaming loaf of decadent brown bread on some exotic wooden cutting board with a bottle of smokeless scotch opened just next to it.\n\nIt has the taste of a ball of dough rolled in rich and bitter cocoa nibs. Once that slightly fades you can taste some wood that a little alcohol has been spilled on.\n\nIt feels smooth like hot cocoa down to the fact that it warms your mouth with the high alcohol content. Mild carbonation prickles a little and when you swallow you're left with a dry and clean bitterness.\n\nOverall it's really interesting. I like it and it's unique. I give it a 5.3 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep brown appearance with a large, dense, tan head and good lacing. Aroma is a mix of molasses, chocolate and vanilla extract over the wood. Sweet, roasted malt flavors along with some dark fruit. Hops take their time to clock in and you may have to wait a bit for them to register. Full bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel. Lingering, sweet, slightly cloying finish. Alcohol was warming but approached the 12% in a stealthy fashion.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev look: so brown it's block, a frothy, lively head\n\nsmell: one of the best parts. the palo santo marron wood of course gives it some woody scent (redwood? rosemary?), but also a very savory char. like a BBQ smoker\n\ntaste: soy sauce, barbecue sauce, salami, rosemary, thyme, sage. i can't get over how savory this is. i don't even get a ton of acutal oak or wood, it just tastes like someone stacked their smoker with some very tasty wood, and made a bunch of meat. it's not a campfire beer, it's a barbecue beer, in that it tastes like a whole meal\n\nfeel: not hot at all, thick and syrupy. minimal carbonation.\n\noverall: special place in my heart. i love meal beers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A truly wonderful experience! I love brown ales and this is one of the best I've had. The worst thing is I live in Tennessee and that is a long way from Delaware.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev PSM is the embodiment of the wood aging process. This ale is boozy and full of woody dryness and strength.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled in 2016 and opened in 2020 --- probably too long to wait, but it's 2020 so who knows what the standards are? Pours a dark black brown, little head or lacing, chocolate foam barely on the glass. Smells the rich, boozy tableau of a pastry stout. But the taste is where the aging went wrong. We veered past mellow and straight into deterioration and astringency. Ah, well. At least I'll have a headache tomorrow.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottles 4/24/20\n\nI actually set one of these aside in the cellar before drinking a freah one, pretty sure it’s a 2019 and I plan on drinking it next year for my college graduation\n\nPours a rich dark brown with a finger of khaki head that reduces to a cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nAromas of toasted malt, caramel, vanilla, and light milk chocolate. Really just a touch of oak but nothing spectacular\n\nThe taste starts off charred, more roasty like a stout. Some intense vanilla and rich malt with dark roast coffee. The milk chocolate comes out on the finish\n\nQuite the light feel for a brown but still full in flavor with moderate carbonation leads to a smooth and nearly dry finish\n\nThis was not exactly what I was expecting, I wanted my mind to be blown. I guess that ones on me, but I’ve heard it gets better with age. I’ll have to set aside other beers for graduation too, but this will be nice\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo, the day has finally come. I graduated from college with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering earlier today (okay, yesterday really) and now it's time to whip out a bottle of this I've had for a while dated 4/12/19. Let's dive right in\n\nStill looking the same in color but with a slightly bigger head and more lacing (3.75-&gt;4)\n\nHoly hell, the wood in this older bottle is significantly more present. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted oak, pecan, creamy vanilla, espresso beans, brown bread, and subtle milk chocolate (4.25-&gt;4.5)\n\nHonestly this tastes pretty similar to what I have noted from the fresh bottle, just a little less roasty and charred. Maybe it could actually use some more time in this regard (4-&gt;4)\n\nThe body remains identical here, but I do think it deserves a slight bump up from before (4-&gt;4.25)\n\nOverall this has to go (4-&gt;4.25). This definitely impressed me more than it did initially, but I think setting another bottle aside would be fun to see how the taste evolves",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very dark, appealing brown ale. Almost totally opaque like a stout. Smells great! Smokey, roasted caramel scent with some vanilla aromas. Very flavorful, complex brew, but it's a little too sweet. It feels a little syrupy and thick, unfortunately. It's a great beer for someone who has been dabbling in the waters of craft brewing and enjoys darker, sweeter beers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This brewery, they do as they please, because they’re established and have the following to do so. I personally commend them for making beer that nobody else would. With that being said sometimes it’s too over the top and that’s the case with this brown ale. I’ve never seen a Brown Ale with such a high ABV. It’s too over powering and doesn’t drink like any brown ale I’ve had. Honestly if they toned this down a bit , could be a really amazing brown. Worth a try but not high on my repeat list.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’m very impressed with Stone for this one—most Stone IPAs have the same exact generic bitterness; however, this one is different; this one has a balanced hop flavor, balanced bitterness, and is oh-so-smooth. Pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in, yet looks basically black poured into a glass. Has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. The 8.7% ABV is extremely well-hidden in this brew. Honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip, with the melody of flavors. I’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and I have no idea why I’m already feeling buzzed. Nice work on a unique brew, Stone. Try it while you can as it is a limited re-release.",

The color charts around SRM 6, pale gold with amber yellow hues.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy amber. Thick foam. Malty aroma. Big flavors. Bitter hop body followed my syrupy malt sweetness. Light brown sugar finish. You can taste the alcohol. Complex but well balanced. An excellent strong ale.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle pours a deep reddish-brown in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong aromas of grapefruit and caramel candy. Full bodied with a thick almost syrupy mouthfeel. Sugary, dark fruit and caramel flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wowser, this is a pretty stout Am Strong Ale!! For me, it is is a bit overpowering with the initial bite and then the finish is a bit bitter. It is a really good beer for this style, but I cannot say that I find it to be a great beer. I know that is weak but that is just due to my taste. As always, I recommend you try this (if interested in the style) and form your own opinion.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottling code from September 2019\n\nDark translucent copper, one finger of beige head, clumpy lacing. partial cap, variegated bubbles.\nCaramel, dates, dark honey, spice cake aromas\nLight hop tart orange citrus, pine, yet also brown sugar, and caramel flavors\nSubstantial body, alcohol noticeable, initial hop bite, but nice balance that drinks too quickly. Lingering hop tingle. Carbonation dissipates steadily but is stubborn given the ABV.\nEvergreen standby in the winter months.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a deep, clear, orange color (slightly amber) with a moderate off-white head. SRM of 17. (3.50)\n\nAroma: Strong aromas of sweet caramel and syrup. Syrupy soaked, brown-sugar baked, French Toast. Mostly syrup, brown sugar. Some cardboard as the sweetness rides up the nose. (3.50)\n\nFlavor: Flavor follows the nose folks with a dirty, sweet but also dank hop flavors. Straight syrup and bitterness, but enveloped completely by a syrup, brown sugar, and cardboard sweetness. Then you think you're done. But another wave of sweetness drizzled-syrup comes through. As you can guess, another wave of sweetness lingers through the end. (3.25)\n\nFeel: Heavy, sweet, syrupy. Actually good carbonation, but then it gets enveloped by the sweetness. Surprisingly enough carbonation to keep it from being resinous though. (4.00)\n\nOverall: A thick, heavy, syrupy rendition of a beer. Tons of brown sugar, caramel sweetness. There are hops. But completely enveloped by the sweetness. If you took a 9% imperial IPA, then dumped brown sugar in for another 2-3% of sweetness, then that is this beer. Caramel, syrup, and then even cardboard sweetness. The sugar hides the alcohol but discloses a syrup-soaked cardboard flavor. Dear God, please don't make this Diabetes Bomb again.

The first sip, all foam to prevent overflow. Excellent. The second, a good mouthful of Velvet ale, tropical fruits and pine resin, luscious! Velvet on the tongue, not as thick as a poster or stout, but serious backbone from the malts. Very drinkable, not overpowering. Sweet, not cloying, I want another one, but the price here in Minneapolis is a little overwhelming. Overall, if you can find it, try it. And I hear Dinner is even better."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a very deep, dark brown. The look is black, but held to a light you can see the deep ruby shades going through. No beer so far that’s been nitro’d has the ability to pour as big a nitro head as Guinness — but Young’s comes very close, with a thick, dense finger tall head that looks a little more watery and a little more creamy than other nitro stouts. Hard to ever rate nitro beers low on the looks department.\n\nWonderful aromas of dark chocolate, chocolate dust, cacao beans, roasted coffee, caramelized sugar in sticky toffee pudding, and light burnt and toasty malts. What can you say? It’s good!\n\nTaste follows the nose, but is regrettably more watery with a thinner body than the nose suggests. They do not lie about the chocolate, dark chocolate intermingles with milk chocolate on the finish, which is a bit sweeter. Gentle bitterness from the roasted malt on the front. Earthy with a nice almond-esque nuttiness throughout.\n\nBased on the style I’m almost tempted to say this is a lighter bodied stout but I’d say it’s square in the medium bodied category. This is straight up nitrogenated, there is barely even a tickle of the tiny bubbles on the palate. Not quite flat, however, this creates a very very smooth mouthfeel. As smooth as you can possibly get, even more than other nitro stouts. Semi-dry finish that leans to the sweet side.\n\nI will be honest, I came into the review a little disappointed. I am used to Young’s like the picture on BA, the nice dark glass in the regular carbonation. Ironically, I actually love nitro stouts. But years ago when I first started drinking good beers, I loved to split Young’s with a friend. One of the first real chocolate stouts on the market, and it was so good. Not sure if I’ll ever find a bottled one again. \n\nThat all being said, this was still not bad. You sacrifice certain aspects and bolder flavours for the smoother ride of the nitro when you go for the widget can. This is still a remarkable beer, one that is actually pretty easy drinking for people used to stouts and nitros. Could easily have a few in a night. The flavours are subtle but varied and complex enough to make a great beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly black, color with a moderate light tan head. SRM of 22-23. (3.75)\n\nAroma: Mild aromas of English cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa nibs, some earthy black malts. Smooth lactose. (3.75)\n\nFlavor: Smooth flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. Some tobacco &amp; smoke. This smooths into a milk chocolate, dark malt, and creamy lactose on the end. (3.75)\n\nFeel: Lighter bodied. Low carbonation. Drinks sort of flat with tobacco bitterness and cocoa lingering on the finish. (3.50)\n\nCompared to Founders' Porter 3/7/22: Pours a similar color, milder and lighter head. Milder aromas. More bittersweet chocolate, tobacco bitterness. Less chocolate, espresso, lactose. Lighter body.\n\nOverall: An English Stout for sure with the bittersweet chocolate and tobacco notes intermixed with the chocolate. Lighter-bodied and under-carbonated in my opinion. Has the English flavors, but that was about the only thing I found enlightening about this beer. (Final Rating: 3.73)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 4pk of 12oz bottles (Best before 23 JAN22) picked up at the Arundel Preserve Wine and Spirit: Hesitated a long time prior to trying this, &quot;Double Chocolate&quot; sounded like way too much chocolate. Frankly, could barely smell it and even that might have been &quot;peer pressure&quot;. More, but thankfully NOT overwhelming chocolate on the tongue with some malt thrown in. A smooth drinker, but I don't think I'll be coming this way again anytime soon.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The pour was a very smooth dark chocolaty pour. The smell reminds me of a very strong malt chocolaty smell on the nose. The taste was actually very surprising as you could taste the malts and chocolates. Over all this stout is very unique in it's own way and I would definitely enjoy a bottle every weekend!!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a beautiful, inviting head with aromas similar to a chocolate milk, rather than chocolate itself. On the palate, the beer is much more straight forward with a heavy blend of both milk and dark chocolate qualities and roasted malts, much to my surprise of the rather subtle aroma. Moderate carbonation with a perfect lingering finish. Extremely creamy and smooth; like a Nitro brew. The smoothest beer I've had which actually blows my mind. Beautiful combination of a strong chocolate taste without being too heavy or sweet, which comes unexpected from the much lighter aroma.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours jet black with a 0.5&quot; tan head, settling out to a solid ring, nice streaky lacing. Nose is chocolate milk, chocolate syrup, and light roast. Taste is milk chocolate, a bit of bitter baking chocolate, and some deeper roast notes. Mouthfeel on the thin side, but helps avoid this from getting too heavy. Delivers noticeable chocolate flavor without becoming overly sweet or heavy. Warrants respect for its subtlety.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've had this beer in both cans and bottles. The cans I purchased locally in winter '19-20 and found that the taste was negatively effected. It was slightly metallic. While in London at a Young's pub in summer 2019, I had a 500 ml bottle. It was very nice -- smooth, creamy, with chocolate notes. I was surprised it was not on draft, but perhaps it was because it was summer. Still, it was a cool and rainy day in mid-June.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: This was poured from widget can, so the bottle pour might be very different. Pours a rich dark brown on hair below black. Pours like a Guiness with all the seperation expected. BIg 2 finger tawny head. The head lasts forever still a finger high at 5 minutes. The head is dense and marshmellow like. Sticky as can be. \n\nSmell: Dark chocolate, but so subtle. Maybe the head is holding it in but way to subtle to be appreciated. \n\nTaste: Watery up front, both dark and milk chocolate, with hints of almond nuttiness. \n\nThis beer is a total enigma. Phenomenal look, disappointing smell, decent taste, and a mouthfeel that starts out weak but picks up some steam in the end. As a big fan of chocolate stouts, this is kind of disappointing. I'd say this beer is far too muted. It earns a B-\n\nFeel: Very watery up front, but it finishes with a creamy dryness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours similarly to a Guinness, just a lot darker. Smells mostly like cocoa, with a slight coffee aroma. The taste is very chocolaty, and with the bitterness of the beer, its like a very dark chocolate. Like an 80% dark chocolate. The beer is extremely creamy, and creates a wonderfully pleasant feeling. The perfect carbonation for a stout. Almost smoother than a nitro brew. This beer is very good and i would highly recommend it to a fan of stouts.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: So dark that light can't pass through it. Like my soul :3c nice persistent foamy head\nSmell: Chocolate (DUH ITS CALLED CHOCOLATE STOUT DUHHHHHHHHHH), tobacco, Bailey's\nTaste: It has chocolate flavor, but is missing the creaminess that I personally associate chocolate with. Notes of malt and black coffee. Strong black coffee/dark chocolate aftertaste.\nFeel: Not much carbonation. Pretty smooth and dry. Would not go on a second date with a man like this.\nOverall: One of the better stouts I have drank, but I am not much of a stout cat. Its not too dry which I like, and the flavor is not intense so it is very drinkable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks great. Dark with smooth creamy head. The Widget really does its job. Scent is too weak, even taking into account the thick head. I liked the roasted slight hint of chocolate taste but I'm not a chocolate and coffee beer enjoyer. I feel for the style the chocolate could have been group out more prominent. Smooth perfect bitterness feel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance - Pours a jet black with two fingers of creamy tan head.\n\nSmell - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, coffee bean, earthy and leafy hops, dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig), and earthy yeast. \n\nTaste - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, and coffee bean upfront. The earthy and leafy hops come through next followed by the dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew. \n\nMouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering. \n\nOverall - A flavourful sweet stout that delivers on all flavours. I am impressed on how velvety smooth this beer is with all the bold elements in it. A stand out in this category and deserving of a try from those that haven't sampled it yet.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev the head is perfect, super smooth.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle split between two pint glasses to share. Pours just barely off-black with two fingers of tan to dark tan head. It dissipates faster than I would have guessed, based on the thick appearance of the head. some lacing. Not a lot of smell considering this is &quot;double chocolate&quot;. Not a lot of chocolate in the taste, either. A bit of bitter chocolate coming through. Nice balanced mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to let you know it is not flat. Overall pretty good....but sooooo many better stouts to choose.....",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Youngs was my local brewery for a few years of my life. I still remember what a revelation Double Chocolate was when it first came out in bottle.\nI recently found this in can with a nitro capsule. It is not remotely the same beer. Pours a very appealling black with a creamy tan head. Follows with fabulous fragrant nose. Then it is all downhill, very thin and entirely missing the big chocolate hit. So disappointing.\nSearch this out in bottle and give the can a wide berth.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a one finger tan head. This brew was really cool to pour, all the carbonation seemed to fall in waves to the bottom of the glass.\nS: Very rich smells of dark chocolate, nice roasted grains from the malts, has a cream aroma as well. \nT: Taste follows the nose, has a nice bitter coffee like aftertaste. \nF: Full-bodied, very low carbonation, thick &amp; creamy mouthfeel.\nO: Not a bad stout, much like Guinness. None of the flavors really stood out to me though.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 16oz can with nitrogen widget, on a chilly fall day just before sunset. \nNice thick head that you need to wait to form after pouring so the nitrogen can do its thing. Nice thick lacing left on the glass. Color is dark brown and really opaque. \nAroma is chocolate first and subtle dark fruit.\nTaste is all chocolate and luxurious. Hints of that dark fruit show up in the background but chocolate is the overall flavor- not bitter but really smooth.\nMouthfeel is really smooth as expected with nitrogen widget. So creamy and luxurious, but not syrupy. \nOverall, what a satisfying and drinkable beer! I have to admit i always thought this beer would be too syrupy sweet but of course i failed to recognize that Young's knows what they are doing. I can't wait to buy this again.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I first met Stella in Antwerp, Belgium in 1991 working on a merchant cargo ship during Desert Storm. After the first taste at the nearest pub in port we've been steady daily since then. I found it to be consistent worldwide until now. Can't explain but the tastes is off. St. Louis water source?

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It took me many years to rate Stella, as I haven't been drinking lagers for maybe a decade. Except when someone gives me one as gift. Like this Stella. It used to be a well liked, go to beer a couple of decades ago, so let's see. \nPours from a can like white wine with no head retention. Gosh, I haven't had a beer that I can see through for a long while, but here it is. The nose is of weak malt and some sugar. No skunk smell, but pee smell, yes. The taste is muted everything. No real flavour, just the malt, a little yeast and some hop, maybe. Also notes of rice. The aftertaste is unfortunate and there is an oily feel. \nIn the olden days, I couldn't finish Labatt's Blue, because it was full of empty bubbles. Now, I am not sure whether I'll be able to finish this. Actually, I am sure I can't.\nIs this the same Stella I liked in the past? Have my taste buds adjusted to well crafted, low production beer, so I now can't go back to something like this? Is it because it's weak and I don't really drink beer under 6.5ABV anymore?\nI don't know. But too bad. I thought it would be a trip down memory lane. But it's just a trip to uncomfortable-gas-trapped-in-my-stomach feeling.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light malt flavor. Somewhat dry feel. No bitterness. Nothing special.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the can, just to avoid slinky beer. I had heard that this might be good and seen the commercials as a kid touting Stella as the peak of sophistication. I had high expectations. The smell was my first clue. Even from the can there was a stale skunked odor that told me that things were not going to get better. The first taste was dry and had a strange bitterness- not the pleasant kind. The finish had a lingering after taste akin to licking a stick of solid stick deodorant. I was unable to find any redeeming qualities in this beer… except the can looked and felt very fancy and well made. Wished they spent as much time on what was inside the can.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Since the strength dropped, I will not buy anymore.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good solid lager. Better finish than Heineken. Refreshing. Good flavor and alcohol content. I basically am a lager fan. I would rate Stella a 4 if Budweiser had not have bought it. Sam’s club has it $22/case which is a great value. I can’t stand wine and hard alcohol is too hard on my brain. Stella is like a solid table beer. Will buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I came on here just now to pan the skunky Stella Artois and discovered that many people give it high ratings. I just had some and had to throw out the rest, skunky aroma/flavor made it 100% unenjoyable. I read an article after trying Stella today that talked about how skunk happens to certain beers due to light colored bottles and they mentioned Stella Artois specifically, so I know I'm not alone in finding it skunky. Whatever the reason for it, it takes every single category down to 1 since they don't have a lower category number.",

With subsequent sips I soon realized the flavor is somewhat thin. \nThis beer was brewed in St. Louis &quot;under the strict supervision of the brewmasters from Leuven, Belgium...&quot; and is bottled in 11.2 ounce bottles. So, a beer with thin flavor, brewed in St. Louis and packaged in an 11.2 ounce bottle at an imported price leaves room for improvement. Overall, not bad, just not great.",

Moderate lacing.\n\nAroma is floral, caramel, light citrus, grassy hops.\n\nTaste is caramel, citrus, light pine.\n\nLight to medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry finish.\n\nPretty decent Pale Ale. Less bitterness than an IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's a shame they are no longer at their Burlington, VT spot because I wish I could visit the once popular home to this wonderful serum. Anyways, a bronze liquid fills my glass with a foamy white head. Fairly standard appearance, but a wonderful aroma of apricot/fruity sweetness permeates the glass. A sip and you quite literally are mystified by this beer. What am I drinking? It's got a sweet flavor to it with an almost malty touch. A really crisp clean beer that is unique and hard to describe, but really what it is is delicious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a solid beer that tastes reminded me of my first taste of home-brewed IPA: more floral fragrant with prevalent apricot notes. One of my favorite all-time recommendations, but maybe not for everyone’s palette if into heavy or bitter brews.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 9/9/290, so 8 months old.\n\nFaintly hazy pale amber body. No head retention, hence no lacing.\n\nNot much of an aroma. Somewhat fruity.\n\nOn tasting, the fruit is there, with a fairly strong sour bitterness.\n\nMouth medium, finish sour bitterness \n\nOverall, none too pleasant to this palate, and I dont think its age related.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beer pours a little cloudy with a little head, and a few small particulates. Smells more like a fruity ale than an IPA (which I like). tastes pretty good in my opinion, but not as hoppy as a pale ale( perhaps that's why it says not quite pale ale on the front). It's like your average run of the mill ale, but just a bit more fruity and a light hop flavor towards the end. The carbonation is mild, not smooth like nitro brews, but relatively soft. Overall I could drink em all day and not be sick of the taste, but it would be my first choice if I was looking to only drink a beer or two after dinner. That being said if I see them in the custom six pack fridge I would be okay with adding one of these.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice amber color. Smooth crisp after bite. Not heavy feel, nice for after work?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A definite rich color and apricot/fruit smell. It claims it's not quite an ale, and it feels like it needs a bit more in the hoppy department to even out the fruit flavor. With all that said, if on a hot day you need something not hoppy and not a lager, this works quite well as an evening drink after a day in the yard.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Perfectly fine, didn't realize it was a fruit and field beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Been awhile\nSince I had this\n\nMy first foray into modern craft\nBack \nWay back but\nVery tasty fruity\nMalt\nYeast\nSticky\nAs has been noted.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle - over a year old - poured into a squat pint and fridge temp.\n\nPours a somewhat darker amber hue, quite clear, and topped with a finger of tam head that recedes quickly. \n\nNose: Caramel malt lends some sweet bready notes with toffee and caramel and plenty of resinous hops bring some pine, grass, and hugely fruity aroma with notes of apricot, papaya, and peach rings. This is categorised as a fruit and field beer, so I'm wondering if there's some peach or something in here. Also a slight herbal spice note, like fresh oregano. \n\nPalate: Crazy dry out of the gate. Given the sweet malty aroma, i was expecting something cloying and sticky, but that isn't the case here. There is some crystal malt flavour, but it's amidst some very pale malt and grainy wheat. There is some subtle hopping, lending a nondescript floral and fruity character, and then a clear sign of there being some fruit in here. I'm guessing mango. Ive had other mango IPAs, and this is very similar. If it isn't mango, it's some other stone fruit - peach, apricot, nectarine, etc.. but my guess is mango. Some lightly bitter and highly floral hop resins in the finish with that stine fruit becoming even bigger before a quick, clean, abrupt finish. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: Medium-light in body, very crisp, snappy, and refreshing, with lower effervescence. It feels fairly dry elevating the crisp drinkability. Slightly drying hoppy finish. Clean.\n\nOverall: So I'm convinced there's a fruit in it, I'm just not sure what. Mango? Apricot? It reminds me a lot of Ffirst Cut from Troegs. Nevertheless, it's actually quite enjoyable, crisp, and refreshing, and would be easy to drink a couple of these in rapid succession. It also clearly holds up well. It isn't something I'd go out of my way for and I certainly wouldn't trade for it, but for a cheap shelf beer, I like it."

What a lovely surprise. So much so, going back to baseline e.g., Two Hearted) is boring... I just want to drink another red Surly. It's the hoppy balance with a bit of bite (rye?). I live in Indiana. and wish they offered it in the Hoosier state.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A tremendous IPA. It pours a deep amber color with strong lacing. Lots of citrus, with some sweetness like caramel or maybe butterscotch. And a truly smooth mouthfeel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned in October. No doubt the hops have shifted in their representation. Still an impressive hop forward IPA that pays homage to the left coast but establishes its on identity. \n\nHuge head, tons of lace. Lots of pine and citrus What's really lovely is the Scottish malt base. \n\nNice amount of pine and citrus hits the nose with significant force. Good amount of biscuity malt.\n\nSolid malt front is quickly subsumed by the huge hop component. Pine starts with a big and firm citrus follow through. Super clean and dry finish with a surprising amount of malt. Light hop oil.\n\nFeel is solid and easy drinking. Solid carbonation and quenching swallow. \n\nThis reminds me a bit of the early West Coast IPAs like Pizza Port et al. Bigger and heavier malt backbone give it a distinctive personality. Hops are huge and all over this beer. A nice bookend to the other great midwest/heartland American IPA, Bells Two Hearted. Great overall brew. British malt, American hopping. Wonderful beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a can dated 07/14/2020 and sampled much later on March 26, 2021.\n\nHandsome looking amber-bronze pour with a notable, puffy off-white head. \n\nThe hops may be a bit stale at this point but I am still getting pine and fruit elements on the nose as well as a decent caramel malt backbone.\n\nThe mouthfeel is medium.\n\nThe taste is at first sweet and then the pine bitterness presents itself as it moves along. Moderate bitterness at the end. Despite the age of this can, it is clearly a balanced traditional IPA...the kind of IPA that you do not see as much as the juice bombs that are out there.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This one is a deep and clear amber color that looks like pine tree sap in a glass. Aroma is very pine forward, but I get a huge whiff of brown sugar. This one has a very earthy and pine-forward hop flavor, and that brown sugar in the aroma comes through in the taste. One of my favorite IPAs, and with all of the NEIPAs I have been trying lately, this is always a fun one to come back to. For an aggressively hoppy brew, you get so much more than bitterness out of it. Desert Island IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a dark nutty amber with a hint of fog to it. Head is two fingers of khaki foam that forms a luxurious pillow across the top of the beer. Aroma is biting hops, hitting notes of resiny, dank, pine, herbal hops. Storyline is really all hops, with an aggressive bite up front. Flavor profile is resiny, dank, herbal, medicinal, and pine hops with a bready malt backbone. Malts do a little to quell the initial swell of hops, but the hops drive this beer from the start. It has less hop bite in the flavor profile than the nose, striking a better balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a constant and consistent bubbly effervescence throughout. It straddles the line between crisp and refreshing and bold and sippable, encouraging the drinker to consume in either fashion. Overall, hop bite reminiscent of old school IPAs, this is one of those IPAs that gave them the reputation of being &quot;overly hoppy&quot;. Despite that reputation, this beer retains a good balance within the style, offering up abundant hops in a punchy, aggressive beer.\n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can."

Crystal clear straw color with no haze.\n\nSmell is carrying some grapefruit and tropical notes with a fruity sweetness. I cant pick much else up with this sickness, my nose isnt quite functioning.\n\nThe taste is bold with bittering hops right in your face and a nice trickle of fruity flavors following behind it. Maybe a tad bit of malt backing it up, but nothing crazy, just firm pale malts standing in the back.\n\nThe feel on the other hand suggests more malts than I'm tasting the head comes back to life as you drink especially in large amounts slowing you down. But it does feel relatively seasonable other than that not too heavy on the stomach.\n\nOverall a standard every day ipa for those that love ipas it isnt shy about the hops and the malts are firm enough to keep it steady.

I haven't had this in years so won't debate how it holds up against its former 'independent' self, and I don't care. It's a fine IPA, clear amber-yellow and classically bitter and malt-balanced, straight up citrus/pine hops and a dry hoppy finish.\n\nI wouldn't have picked it up in a store, but happy to drink these from a friend.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not bad. This is an English IPA? Not really",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer pours a clear gold color. Leaves a thin head that recedes quickly. Looks nice. Small bubbles fizzle along the sides of the glass. \n\nThe smell, to me, comes off as a bright smell. White bread, refreshing citrus (namely grapefruit), and a nice hoppy smell. The smell of alcohol is also prominent on the end. Also a little bit of a malty smell. \n\nTaste is pretty refreshing. It follows the smell for the most part. There is a nice hoppy bitterness, followed by a pretty profound slightly sweet and citrusy grapefruit flavor. A little bit of a malty flavor in there as well. Nothing “special” about it but it is good. \n\nThe feel of this beer is alright. It’s got a nice prickly carbonation. Not the smoothest beer out there but there is a smoothness to it.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I regard this as one of the more well-balanced English style IPA's out there. Of course, most of the hop-heads in this group think it's weak, not hoppy enough, and because it's made by AB InBev, well, it must be shite. I do think it needs another point or point and a half of ABV, but other than that, it's a pretty good pour. It is not overpowering in any category, and I know that's blasphemy to the guys on this group, most of whom I truly believe are into BDSM or something, they just love getting clobbered over the head with hops and ridiculous amounts of alcohol and weird ingredients. Whatever, this is a solid and reliable beer that is available anywhere, in case you find yourself driving around in a bad neighborhood and you need a decent road soda to get you back home, you can find it at a gas station, bodega or seedy grocery purveyor. Grow a set willya.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very strong hoppy smell. It is a pale golden color with a slight haze. Nice head that retains well. Has a very sweet hoppy tase and is slightly bitter. Not a very crushable beer. 57/100",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from the tap into a pint glass in Georgia. A pure clear golden color with a fizzy off white head. Smell is light with sone citrus and floral notes. Bready malt backbone is fleeting but present, alongside some toasted malt. Taste is soapy, like seriously so, lemony, and slightly floral. Some pine in the finish. Has some toasted malt and some caramel sweetness in the mix. An ok, drinkable IPA."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev very citrus smell. looks great. has a nice color. has a nice wheat taste with a kick of lemon. very nice summer beer. has the perfect citrus taste without being too overwhelming.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I have been drinking these since they were released this year in 2021. It is a refreshing beer that has a nice accent point on citrus fruit and wheat. A great example of an American wheat beer with from the look, smell and taste. Seems like they went with a more neutral yeast not giving strong bananas or clove flavors leaving the flavor to be driven by the malts, adjuncts and the spices added.\nThe look is a hazy gold beer with lots of carbonation when poured into a glass from a bottle. The smell is fruity with the main scents of citrus based fruits. The mouthfeel is a low medium to medium and pleasant while also being refreshing. The taste is mostly general citrus and a hint of malt which quickly disappears after swallowed leaving you wanting another sip. Overall for a seasonal beer this one hits the spot for a spring beer transitioning to a summer beer with plenty of nice flavor and also being refreshing to down a few.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had one from its own can and my housemates took the other 2. Punchy lemon and tangerine are at the forefront backed up by wheat. There is a spiciness to it that I assume comes from the grains of paradise that are described. The overall taste is more robust than the Porch Rocker, another Sam Adams summer &quot;lawnmower beer&quot; brewed with lemon. While the two serve the same purpose, the Summer Ale is the more memorable of the two. A light body with medium carbonation make it easy enough to drink, though it may be on the thin side.",

Mildly spicy \n\nNice mix of lemony citrus and moderate spiciness. Like the scent, very clean and fresh. mildly sweet with a dry finish\n\nEasy to drink, light to medium/light in body. Not overly carbonated. Refreshing and very drinkable. Not my favorite , but not bad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is an odd beer as I rate it differently based on the month. During the summer this is one of my top beers. The lemon is very apparent and it makes for one of the best grilling beers available. I’ve had this during colder days and it doesn’t give me nearly the satisfaction. I’d highly recommend for outdoor social events as this is essentially summer in a glass."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev February 1st, 2015 - RuinTen has since taken off around San Diego, but I remember back in 2015 it looked novel and new, and somewhat pretty in the glass, where it burns with that characteristic Stone hue, red and blushing and angry looking. The foam kicks up a fearful storm, too, taking up fully half of this pilsener glass (an unwise choice, I know). The aroma is layered with resin and a leather sharpness defines the hop note. There's some grapefruit too and even a dash of dry lime, but the overall impression is of an appreciably dry and hoppy nose. Consistent with the smell, the flavor is dry and hoppy, but there's also a malty body to back it up. I also get the deep savory flavor of miso (as if smeared on a piece of meat prior to grilling). The aftertaste is little short, but reveals the miso glaze flavor bundled with a bitter twang. This ask a slow sipper, but enjoyable over that long time. I should also note that the booze stays relatively hidden, so caution is advised if drinking with excessive speed."

Nothing out of place but nothing particularly outstanding or memorable imo.\n\n*I’ve subsequently drunk this beer on draught and it’s better in that format.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is an amazing beer. I have no idea why the named it after the official beer from India. The Indian made beer is like a nice coors lite. This is a man's beer. Fruity mango. Nice balance between 10% and sweet n bitter. Love it. Get it if you can",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Ok this one is pretty. It's a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. It smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes, but it's not as fragrant as expected. The alcohol is present on this one. The gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. This one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer. I could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like I've over done it, which is rare with me and DIPAs. If you see it on draft get yourself a pull but I don't see myself buying a four pack of this.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The color is a beautiful dark gold that lightens slightly at the top of the glass. Head is nicely developed and remains on edges of glass well after pour. I was surprised by the smell— sweet for an imperial, with mango and pineapple immediately, along with a twinge of dank hops. The taste is big and complex. Sweet at first, with the mango and pineapple, becoming floral pine and bready malt, finishing moderately dank and bitter. The 10% is apparent after a few sips. Feel is wonderfully creamy, soft, and wet, which seems to balance the big flavor and ABV. \nI can’t say huge IPAs are my favorite, but this beer does everything so well I can’t help but appreciate it.

Another example of &quot;overkill&quot;.",

I also get some pine and a bit of sulfur and a hint of thymol (Listerine note). This is not nearly as dark and dank as Avery describes. It is not too bitter but rather presents too much of a sharp alcohol character.\n\nMouthfeel is slick and medium bodied with drying astringency and alcohol. Very light carbonation and a hint of metallic tang.\n\nI am glad I got to try this beer. The beer did not taste super hoppy unless it is those &quot;off&quot; notes of thymol and pine resin mixed with alcohol that is just not doing it for me. It is certainly drinkable and interesting but I don't think I would buy it again as I prefer Odell Myrcenary quite a bit more."

Pours a lovely amber, I didn't get much of a head but the lacing is there. Smells wonderful, like grapefruit, lemon, malt and a nice vegetal essence. The taste is definitely balanced, in an impressive way with sweet malt as a backbone and sharp citrus notes with bitter hops all dancing in harmony. Slightly quick and clean finish. Each sip makes me want more, but at 9.0% abv this one is dangerous.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This has a nice semi dark amber color to it, perfectly clear and very effervescent. The head is thick, about two and half fingers and very bubbly and long lasting.\nNice citrus smells, lemon rind and grapefruit rind mixed in with a mild wheat grass and pine aromas and a bit of a pungent smell follows that.\nSmooth and very tasty, the grapefruit flavor hits you first, followed by a semi sweet pine and spicy/herbal mix, very earthy. It leaves a nice bitter aftertaste in your mouth. \nThe body feels a bit light for the style, but that being said, the flavor is right on and more than makes up for the feel, overall this is a fun beer to drink.",

There's reasonable balance between the malty sweetness &amp; bitterness of hops.

Aroma is pine, resin, dank, and heavy herbal hops create a old school medicine bomb. Incredibly sticky. Flavor profile is resin, dank, herbal, pine, and medicinal hops. It's a sticky combo that resembles old school cough syrup. Incredibly sticky. Some hop burn at the back adds to the abrasiveness. Mild bready malts add a tiny touch of balance to the hop profile. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with an initial smoothness that turns to a watery, still finish. It stalls out at the finish. Overall, a sticky, old school style IPA that doesn't shy away from abrasive and loud hop notes. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",

Rich malt swaddles the resinous hop acids to gently scrape, not bite the tongue.\nThe body is full-lite, with good heft without being heavy. \nFinish is long and hoppy with a slightly tinny astringency in the aftertaste. Alcohol only peeks in at the end with a smoldering in the back of the throat.\nNothing unique or remarkable but spot on classic Dbl IPA flavors.

The nose comprises sharp hay, dry biscuit, grass, sweet flowers, and funky wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, a touch of mild clove and black pepper swirling around in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a Death Valley level of dryness in the finish. An enjoyable Trappist treat that gets even more interesting with more age on it (4 and 5 years seem to be damn solid right now).",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle dated 8/7/21, drank 1/1/22\n\nThis is the probably the freshest Orval I've ever drank. I'd compare it to drinking a young lambic, and how it mellows out and flavors change over time. Young Orval pours with a ton white foam in the middle and whispy head around the edges. Tons effervescent carbonation and grassy hops. The belgian yeast hasn't had a lot of time to take over yet. I've had this beer several times and now I want to do some side by sides with aging after having this fresh one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is probably the best beer on the planet. No two Orvals taste the same; every bottle offers a unique experience. You can drink it fresh or aged. I am currently imbibing an Orval bottled in April of 2020 and it is out of this world. These Brewers from Brasserie d'Orval only need this single offering and its humble labeling to show what true Masters they are.",

Spicy &amp; earthy.\n\nMouth-Feel: Light to medium bodied, a little creamy. Pours highly effervescent, but releases the carbonation nicely. Drying, moderate length finish with a mild trailing bitterness.\n\nOverall: This would be consider a &quot;young&quot; beer. Bottled in May 2021, drank in November. It still has the yeasty, hoppy character that mellows with age. Curious how this will taste about a year or two down the road. Pours super carbonated, producing a huge, fluffy off-white head, but seems to release the carbonation better than other Belgians. Makes it a little more drinkable. Very nice.",

This was one of the first Belgian ales from Belgium and the first Brett beer I ever tried over a decade ago and just as I was blown away then, I always am each and every time I have this amazingly deep, unique, and delicious beer.

Middle is sweetish with a roof of the mouth hop tang.\n\nMouthfeel is stout like and medium in body with some astringency.\n\nOverall a nice stout but not nearly as awesome as I was expecting. Too much coffee for me. Many more revisits will help me flesh out my thoughts and the review.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz can\n\nPours opaque black, tan head retains as suds.\n\nAroma is smokey, toasty, with coffee notes and some nutty undertones.\n\nFlavor is smokey and toasty up front with some brown sugar, coffee, mesquite, and anise flavors.\n\nFuller body, fizzy carbonation on the tongue.\n\nI've had some of the Yeti variations but this is my first time trying the base version. Very slow drinking and heavy. Flavor is robust, rich, but far from sweet. A very smokey, bitter stout which is an interesting change of pace in the era of the pastry stout. Definitely worth trying and though my palate is a bit trained towards sweeter stouts, I really enjoy this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Oh this is my beloved stout, I love this resinous larch flavor...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Let's pour a 12 oz. can of this beast into a clear pint glass for observation. The liquid is a dense black coffee color with an abundant tight tan head on top. Sufficient glass lacing is left behind after each swallow. Its roasted malt aroma is somewhat resembling cocoa. The taste is rich, with a bitterness contributed to by well roasted malts, some hoppiness and a hint of the generous dose of alcohol. This is a fine Imperial Stout, full flavored, well bodied and devoid of any unnecessary sweetness."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Simply put, this is a very nice IPA. It’s single-hop Citra, which is unusual in todays world. It’s hazy, but not extreme. It’s fruity, but not overly fat and sweet. Balance is the right word. I normally don’t line hazy IPAs very much, but this one I actually line a lot. A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy gold. \n\nLight and inviting floral and citrus aroma. \n\nIt tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind. \n\nMedium bodied and well carbonated.\n\nOverall a great beer. It’s less sharp and more balanced than Zombie Dust or similar Citra APAs, but quite flavorful. And light enough to pair with spicy food.\n\nPoured from a can dated one month ago.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Cloudy straw orange, fluffy white head, very good retention.\n\nAroma: Hops forward. Citrus notes of oranges, tangerines. Tropical fruit.\n\nFlavor &amp; aftertaste: Citrusy &amp; tropical fruit hops flavors. Restrained but balancing bitterness. Medium sweetness.\n\nMouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.\n\nOverall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus &amp; tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy, strawberry wheat color with a white foamy head that hangs for a bit. Some nice lacing surrounds the glass as I sip. \n\nSmells of citrusy hops and a touch of tropical fruits.\n\nTastes great! Very refreshing. \n\nMouthfeel is solid. Light carbonation with a nice viscosity.\n\nOverall a solid brew. Haven’t been able to get this in our area until a few years ago and took a long break from reviews. Picked up a 4 pack to try. Worth the wait.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy light orange with a small fluffy head with moderate lacing. \n\nSmells of piney hops and citrus. \n\nTastes of a mix of tart and sweet citrus with a barely bitter finish. \n\nMedium light body with medium carbonation. Light clean dry mouthfeel. \n\nThis very well made and very drinkable brew!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I order this one by the case. Case closed. The best pale ale ever.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks, smells, and tastes like passionfruit juice. Unbelievable amount of tropical fruit juice flavors and a very (and I mean very) subtle bitterness. This is a substantial yet crushable pale ale. Pretty close to perfection. 4.5/5",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a very cloudy golden color with a thick foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. Juicy orange citrus aroma. There may be a hint of tobacco when colder but gone when warmer. Nice and juicy taste. Orange and tropical. Nice and smooth. Medium bodied with mild to moderate carbonation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 9/15/2021 Very hazy light amber, almost the color of orange juice, unusual bubbly head, recedes fairly quickly to a bubbly cap; nice rich smell; Mild tasty flavor; mouthfeel is okay, moderately carbonated; Good, but not exceptional. Most people rate this beer much higher than I did. Maybe it'll grow on me."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Cloudy bright yellow and even my fairly gentle pour brings on a huge pure white head that swell and holds as a silky pillow, slowly pulling back and leaving great lacing behind\nAroma: Wheat, lemon-orange notes, coriander, wafts of grass, some spice notes, and yeast\nTaste: Spice, coriander, and the lemon-orange citrus note kick it off as waves of wheat malt come crashing in and soon are dominant in the mix. Yeast is present throughout and prominent after the initial hit and closes with wheat, spices, and citrus\nMouthfeel: Full, silky smooth throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and fairly clean finish\nOverall: This is delicious stuff. I enjoy Witbiers a lot, especially in the warmer months and it had been years (sadly) since I had the O.G. of this style so it was an easy purchase. Very tasty and true-to-form – plenty of wheat, coriander, spices, citrus, and yeast all with a killer mouthfeel that really solidifies its place at the top. Highly recommended",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cloudy yellow with a big head. Smell and taste are not quite as bursting with flavour as I had hoped. There's nothing bad about it per se, but it doesn't blow me away. It's There drinkable, but there are better Belgian Witbiers out there.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazy gold appearance with a large, thick white head and good lacing. Yeasty, spicy aroma with tart citrus. Dry spicy flavor with the orange peel more evident in the aftertaste. Medium-to-light bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel leading to an average length finish. Not too bad for such a widely distributed mass produced beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not sure what a 5 beer should be, but this one is close. I pick up a 4 pack of Hoegaarden every now and then as I regard this to be one of those &quot;too much of a good thing&quot; beers. Personally I'll have one on the odd occasion as it's a quality Weiss which is best enjoyed for what it is instead of a night out kinda beer.\nWithout going into details, it's a really good Weiss which can be used as a benchmark beer in this category.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev If you like Belgium Whites, you'll love this one. I've read that it's the archetype of said category, and after having sampled (cases) of both domestic and import variations of said category, I can believe it's the original.\n\nNice cloudy amber with a nice amount of head that stuck around for a while. Not much lacing. Nice &quot;full&quot; mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, not too bubbly. Subtle notes of orange and fall spices.\n\nServed cold on a hot day and you'll be hooked. Great drinkability. (Lot better than the domestic brands that copy that flavor.)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This a mainstream beer, and it's done well. It has what US beers of this style lack entirely at this price point. It's called- class.\nIf you really hate yourself, you can get a Shocktop at this price, but I doubt you would enjoy it. Yes, some 10$ micro brews achieve the same result , but when I open a 10$ per bottle local brew, I expect it to be better, otherwise what's the point. European beers will still beat any US brews at any time of the week when it comes to flavored line of product. It's in the water, it is simply better water in EU. Food, drinks, even drugs have different taste and feeling in Europe, for those who have been there and done it, it's obvious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a nice pale &quot;white&quot; color with heavy, obscuring haze, but not the kind that clouds many of today's &quot;NE IPAs.&quot; The head started fluffy white and prevented me from getting a full bottle into the glass in a single try, even on a fairly light pour.\n\nNose is as expected with banana and an somewhat earthy sorta spice - coriander. There's a little bit of mineral to soapy note like some say of cilantro, but it is missing the herbal aspect of the leafys. Taste brings the mineral water backed by the coriander, with the wheat banana note being a very light platform for these to dance across. A little bit of white pepper joins by mid-taste, and I think it sorta counters and quells an slight increase in banana flavor.\n\nThe feel is fairly thin, and there's more carbonation than I expected. There's more heft and smoothness than a seltzer, but my mind did drift to that drink as I tried to figure this beer out. The back end is actually pretty dry.\n\nLighter overall with a nice aroma the taste (and feel) don't live up to for me."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of the first beers I've ever tasted many years ago. I described it as alcoholic water that's been soaked in bread. \n\nYears later, I'd imagine not much has changed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev So, I'm frequently prompted to drink this in a nearby neighbors' garage upon passing. I am frequently reminded that this is the very worst of all the macros, at least the popular ones. Surely there is worse beer possible, so I left room for those with my rating.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s not a classy, sophisticated, craft beer. I know it. The color doesn’t give you warm fuzzies about it having taste. It smells like any macro in its class, nothing special. All that being said, I enjoy an ice-cold Coor’s Light. It’s light on the palate, refreshing, and not overbearing. You don’t drink it to impress or prove your knowledge of beer. You drink it because you’re a beer guy and it goes well with burgers or wings. It’s also nice to have while watching football or a movie.\n\nIt’s not going to overwhelm you with anything but you know what you’re getting. It’s wholesome, it’s decent, it’s affordable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I grabbed a can of Coors Light from somebody's refrigerator in California. I drank the can of Coors Light and wrote a review...\n\nLook: Coors Light had abundant amounts of foam.\nSmell: Coors Light had a chemical grainy adjunct beer aroma.\nTaste: Coors Light had a vague flavour similar to carbonated water with hints of alcohol.\nFeel: Coors Light had good amounts of fizzy bubbles.\nOverall: Coors Light is a beer for people who will drink anything to quench their thirst.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Back when I was living in LA my roommate bought a case home. That night we had an earthquake. We drank the case and wondered why we weren't even buzzed. It's a silly beer. The next day I went out and got, I think it was called, &quot;Drunken Voodoo&quot; (it had a really cool dead tree illustration), but I digress, and will now get to the point, my roommate never drank Coors again. True story. AMEN",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's a cheap American macro light - you know what you're getting. About as good as it gets for the category. I much prefer macros with corn syrup adjuncts, like Coors, to others that are heavy on rice. Clean and refreshing when ice cold (but don't you dare let it warm).",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a bottle, pours as a clear yellow with lots of carbonation and a thin white head. Adjunct aromas with corn. Light and fleeting malt flavor with a metallic hop bite at the back end. Its best qualities are its carbonation and ability to drink cold on a hot day.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Everything that could possibly be combined into a single terrible beer in one bottle. Almost no flavor, and what taste there is seems artificial. I understand that they are making this for the American market, but it is actually an embarrassment to America when you export this crap.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This the &quot;Summer Chill&quot; edition. Looks and smells ok, like low end beer. Needs to be real real cold and then it is one of the better light beers for the price. Think it has changed over the years - maybe a more pronounced corn taste? Quenches a thirst, not the beer taste buds. Bought to drink when boating and swimming in hot weather.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My first experience of Coors Light (Or Just Coors) here in Australia (as it's classified as full strength being 4.2% ABV), was several years back when Coca Cola first started importing it. Some friends and I had just finished watching a football (soccer) game at Belmore Oval, and we went back to the Belmore Hotel to have a few post-game beverages. Turns out the pub were running a promotion, something like a bucket of Coors (4 bottles) for like $15. Needless to say, being Uni students at the time, and also free pool, we took to it like a Pitbull at a postie. The little I remember of that night, I remember the bar tender telling me they'd be convinced by Coke to order way too much of this beer, and run a promotion on it, assuring the owners of the pub that it would sell like hotcakes. Apparently they'd barely made a dent in their stock, with the locals sticking to local adjunct lagers. My mates and I basically cleared them out of their Coors stock - which I think they were grateful for. Now, I don't remember if I liked it, but we certainly drank plenty of it given how cheap it was. \n\nLook: Very light, straw golden. Thin foam head that has disappeared instantaneously. Looks pretty average to be honest. Looks like carbonated apple juice. \n\nSmell: Wet grass, vegetable aroma, corn husk, some grain that reminds me of porridge. malt sweetness. Smells like a typical adjunct lager beer. \n\nTaste: Grains, slight floral flavour, sparkling water with a bit of beer in it. Honestly tastes like a mineral water shady. Hard to pick up any major flavour notes. \n\nFeel: Watery, carbonated, Would be mistaken for a flavoured mineral/soda water. I suppose it would be refreshing when it's hot and the beer is ice cold, but so can a glass of water, or cold mineral water. \n\nOverall: I hate reviewing beers negatively. But I only do so when there's absoloutely nothing I put a positive spin on. Sure, it's Refreshing when it's ice cold, but why waste the calories on a flavourless beer? If you're looking to get tanked, I mean sure, you can knock these back one after another, until you're inebriated, but why knock back 20 of these when a decent flavoured beer will do the same? \n\nDunno, I suppose there's a place for it, but my fridge unfortunately isn't it. There's plenty of mediocre Aussie beers that I can drink for the purpose of being inebriated, I honestly don't see the market for this in Australia.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's impossible to truly rate beers like Coors Light, There's really nothing there to rate: It's wet, it's carbonated, and it has alcohol, but so would a bottle of mineral water with a shot of Vodka."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A careful pour yields a finger and a half of a large frothy white head, which dissipates leaving a white bubbly ring around the glass. A deep, chestnut brown colour that is very cloudy.\n\nIt’s got a nose as delicious as any strong Belgian dark, so you know what you’re getting. The stars for Rochefurt 8? Deep aromas of raisins and dried dark fruits, sugared and caramelized desserts and fruits, very rich and gorgeous smelling yeasty, doughy breads. A lot of spices mixing in here, I’ve never been an expert on spices but you can always recognize cloves, though I wouldn’t say that’s the major spice smell here. Cardamom? Blackcurrant? \n\nLovely and complex taste, which (as contrived as this always sounds) follows the nose pretty tightly. Those doughy, chewy malts are just too enjoyable. Definitely nice and sweet, the high alcohol level brings tastes of rum, raisins, and figs, as they always do for malty Belgian dark ales. Spicy cloves and peppery notes dance around, the candi sugar on the palate also gives me a gentle cinnamon impression, though it intermingles well with all the spices. Long, tasty doughy finish, very malty and bready. Nutty toffee, caramelized desserts. What else can you say? It’s phenomenal as always. \n\nNow, while the flavours are strong for beers in general, I’m going to say they are wonderfully balanced for Belgian dark ales. Strong dark malty beers like Aventinus Eisbock is more of an explosion of these flavours, and certain other Belgian darks are more unrestrained. This works in this beers favour, for anyone who enjoys the style will enjoy the complex evolution of the flavours over time.\n\nMedium bodied and fairly sweet, this is slightly more carbonated than others in this style, medium carbonation overall. The good carbonation coupled with the small bubbles creates a foamy and creamy sip. Semi-dry finish with well concealed alcohol that emerges just enough to breathe life into the flavours on the palate, giving them a unique dimension.\n\nHell of a beer. Absolutely delicious, while some lament the size of their cellar list, I am always happy I have so many Rochefurt beers in mine!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Yowzer! Really do I need to say much more than it's from Belgium. Okay .... Beautiful dark caramel color, super smooth and delicious and packs a punch too .... Terrific!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a cloudy light brown color with some orange hues towards the bottom. A soft pour produced about three fingers of meringue-like off-white head.\n\nSmell: Yeast, nuts, sugar, old kitchen spices, sage comes to mind as well as allspice.\n\nTaste: Sweet up front, raisin bread, burnt sugar, once the sweetness fades away I get a slightly toasted note along with some nuts. Can't detect any bitterness. \n\nFeel: Medium bodied, loads of carbonation, dry, can't feel any alcohol warmth. \n\nOverall: Delicious. It hides it's abv very well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a chalice glass, the &quot;best before end&quot; date is &quot;L.03.02.2026&quot; which I understand to be March 2, 2026. I also understand the bottled date is five years prior so that would indicate this one was bottled on March 2, 2021.\n\nAPPEARANCE: pours a hazy, brown color and there are larger bits of sediment floating about when held up to light, bountiful two finger head that slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is some lacing on the glass, medium carbonation, a beautiful beer!\n\nSMELL: bread, sweet chocolate, dark fruits like fig and raisin.\n\nTASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet bread and chocolate with dark fruits like fig and raisin, the 9.2% ABV is well disguised.\n\nPALATE: medium body and somewhat creamy, medium carbonation.\n\nOVERALL: this is a great BSDA, I love this style, one of my all time favorites but hard to find, Chimay Blue is the other I can recall having and this one stacks up very well, I will buy this again and will recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beige head that fades to a rim and a bit of lace.

Very smooth for 9.2%—no alcohol burn. \n\nF: Medium bodied with lively carbonation.\n\nO: This is the first beer of the style I’ve tried so I don’t have anything to compare it to. Once I try more, I’ll revisit my review. Still, I’m not surprised it’s #1.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks a light brown. Large head that lingers. Aroma of sweets, sugar and caramel. Taste is similar with chocolate overtones and figs and slightly dank like a dubbel.\n\nFeel is quite light and sweet. Alcohol very well concealed. A very smooth brown ale with some dankness. Very nice",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy, dark amber to mahogany coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of slightly bready, caramel malt and candied fruit, with hints of brown sugar, spice and honey as well. Taste is a great balance of slightly bready, caramel malt and strong candied fruits, with notes of fig, date and plum, as well as lighter apple and apricot, distinct brown sugar and honey, with some spicy accents of clove and cardamon as well. Finishes bittersweet, with a strong sweetness and some candied fruit, brown sugar and hints of spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light carbonation.\n\nWhile this certainly makes for a very rich and complex example of the style, it's just too sweet for my personal taste, which is somewhat mitigated by a light bitterness in the finish, while I can also appreciate those spicy accents, but those overwhelming caramel malt, brown sugar and honey notes are bit much for me, bordering on cloying, while the fruity notes feel quite candied as well, resembling those candied fruit bits you get in fruitcakes. This certainly has a certain feel of fruitcake drenched in honey to it overall and while some may love that, it's really not for me. I much prefer the darker and a bit more roasty and bitter Rochefort 10, which is a lot better balanced to my personal taste.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased at the LCBO on 11/11/21. Stored at 4 C, on it's side, and poured into a chalice. \n\nAppearance - Pours a maduro brown, it's the spitting image of the wrapper of the cigar I'll be smoking after dinner, a CAO Flathead Carb 660, with a medium thickness white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film, a little thicker in the center. \n\nSmell - Strong fruits with a nice nutty, malty undertone tying it all together. I'm picking up raisins, currants and it reminds me of fruitcake. In the best way possible, I like a rich, well made fruitcake. \n\nTaste - Just a slight hint of alcohol burn at first taste, which is quickly killed by the maltyness. The above noted fruit flavours then rush in and it's a long finish more malt and baking spices. \n\nFeel - I love the creamyness of this beer, it's full bodied with carbonation on the milder side of medium. Nicely coats the mouth, enhancing the finish. \n\nOverall - This is one of my favourite beers. Top 3. I prefer it over the 10. The mix of the flavours and just how it's so beautiful tied together is something of beauty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Cloudy, saddle brown. Mousse-like, tan head with great retention\n\nAroma: Fruity esters: plum, apricot, apple\n\nFlavor &amp; aftertaste: Follow aroma, plum, apricot, apple. Low bitterness\n\nMouth-feel: Medium to full- bodied. Moderate carbonation. A little creamy\n\nOverall: Outstanding. Would never know this is a 9.2% abv beer. Nice looking pour with excellent head and retention. Layered fruity esters in the aroma &amp; flavor. These beers always fool me at first. Their aromas seem one or two dimensional at first, but as you make your way to the bottom of the glass, keep swirling and sniffing and more complexity comes out. Very easy drinking. No flaws in this bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark raisin brown in color. Poured with a fizzy, tall, off-white foam with medium low retention. Aromas of dark fruit, sweet fig, and mellow dark malt. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Dark fruity flavors, fig and raisin, with mellow dark malts - similar to aroma. Very low spicy hop flavor followed by pleasant boozy warmth through the end. Finished dryly as the fruity and malty presence was overtaken by the booziness. A pleasant, boozy, cool weather ale. Very nice.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased as a single bottle from The Cellar (Troy) for $5.39. Poured into a crystal pimp chalice I got off Craigslist.\n\nL - Pours a deep, dark brownish amber with a magnificently fluffy and well-retaining three-finger tan head.\nS - Fig, stone fruit, and sweet plum with notes of toast and spice. Little bit of a boozy dried apricot and pound cake.\nT - Raisin and fig are very upfront. The flavor slowly shifts from dark bread crust and plum to a symphony of red apple, cacao nibs, and gingerbread. Towards the bottom of the glass is a resonating boozy note, which backs up some concord grape and molasses. Prune and caramel finish. Well-balanced.\nF - Silky, velvety. Full-bodied with medium carbonation. Incredibly thick. Gives you a very warm feeling by the time you finish. Strong for sure. Satisfying to drink.\nO - I've had every beer from this brewery, but I love that I can finally review them all this week! This brew for a long time was my favorite. Incredible complexity from start to finish. No doubt some of the best flavor in the world of Belgians for under $6. This is a Belgian yeast bomb, and I wouldn't have it any other way! Fruity, bittersweet, and complex. This is one of the best beers you'll ever have the fortune of drinking. I can't recommend this enough.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dried cherry, banana, salted caramel, cinnamon &amp; fruitcake on the nose. Salted caramel, some peppery spice &amp; apple on the palate. Medium body &amp; acidity. Slightly more complex than the 6. I'd imagine it to be good with grilled carrots, and savoury cheeses. With the additional fresh fruit impression, I actually enjoy the purer warmness from the 6 a bit more.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very drinkable. I’m not a fan of IPAs that feel thick enough to bite. This one was smooth without being watery- good balance. Good flavor. Well done. \n\nMy first Deschutes brew. Will try more.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Delicious and lots of hops. Pours with huge head (4 fingers) that leaves tons of lacing. Lots of hops aroma and flavor finishing into mango. Silky and almost creamy mouthfeel. Just a bit lacking on bitterness to throw off the balance. Very very good overall though.",

I was so excited to crack one open, pour it in a tall glass, and let it blow my mind. \nWas I in for a surprise when I got my first sip….this stuff is terrible. Maybe my expectation was, and still is, way too high. I even checked the expiration date on the can…it’s not even close close to the expiration date. I dumped out the first one, grabbed a fresh glass, and tried it again. Ughh, this is just nowhere near a “world-class” rating. Now I have to leave the other 10 cans at a friends house.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev While not a perfect traditional version Saison, this beer has become a essential household favorite. I was extremely skeptical at first because my standard for Saisons is high. This beer pours a clear golden into a tulip glass and holds a clean white head, but not too much. Finishes distinctly edgier than that a traditional Saison, but the bittering hops resemble a slightly citrusy and grapefruitlike finish. As an individual and enjoyable beer, I cant find many faults. The taste is smooth and well balanced. It finishes clean and crisp. On occasion during the lakefront summers, I add a splash of lemonade. Of the zillions of beers the Boulevard makes, this is my crown jewels favorite of theirs.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Extremely pretty beer. Bright, orangey yellow with a strikingly white head. Nose is Belgian yeast with subtle barnyard notes. In the mouth it's soft at first, with prickly carbonation coming to the fore as the beer sits on the tongue. \n\nThere's the usual Saison peppery, funky yeast profile and candy sugar sweetness that dominates at first, with some American hop character following, mainly on the orange/grapefruit side of the spectrum.\n\nBeer finishes dry and peppery. \n\nVery nice beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazy bright gold with a tower of snow white foam that rings + sheets; challah dough and musty lemon rind with bits of bubblegum, white pepper + flowers; honey on fresh bread, pears, marmalade, a bit of cellar, slight rubber bands + pepper, then herbal, grassy, spicy finish; med, thick, smooth, no heat. \n\n4.25 4 4 3.75 3.75\n\nA good looker, and the nose says a lot: sweet, low on phenols, high on esters, and with a thread of farmhouse. \nThe taste is as advertised: orchard fruit esters piling onto a pils + candy sugar base (I’m guessing) with not quite enough pepper or clove, but an unexpected hint of earth instead, then a bunch of hop aromas without much bitterness. \nThis is too sweet, both literally + sensually. The main thing about saison, to me, is the dryness, and regardless of the final gravity, this doesn’t give the impression of finishing dry. You’d never call this “crisp”.\nI’ve heard it’s American hops in here; if so, they’re boosting the esters with citrus + other fruit where they shouldn’t be. And the 38 IBUs need to be closer to 45 or even 50. \nDon’t get me wrong, the craftsmanship is on point: handsome, burn-free, and goes down easy. \nAnd I read where this is a food beer; I can see that - it *needs* food to cut through all the fruit on show here. \nBut it’s not what the Belgians call “digestible” - and whatever its other merits, I can’t forgive it that.\n\nI wanted to love this, and it’s tasty, but I didn’t want a second.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $13.99. I purchased this in early February 2021, even though it was from a high-turnover store, and it was canned on 8/19/20 (best by May 2021). So it's over 15 months old. No big deal though as I've had this beer aged and I've had it relatively fresh and it was enjoyable either way.\n\nLook: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a frothy, thick, rocky off-white head and a subtle haze. The head slowly subsided to almost nothing, but left behind some nice lacing.\n\nSmell: Very aromatic with notes of citrus - lemon peel and grapefruit pith and zest - along with pepper and funky saison yeast. Smells both hoppy and dry. The nose is also somewhat &quot;juicy&quot;. Makes me think that it is going to be mouth-watering and refreshing. A bit of alcohol on the nose as it warms.\n\nTaste: Delicious. Amazing that this beer, in a can, has such a long shelf life. It may have lost some of its hoppy aromatic qualities and brightness, but it is still good. While the nose gives the impression that the beer is going to be juicy, this beer is far from it on the palate. Up front, it's slightly sweet and citrusy. There is a grainy, bready maltiness that comes through in spite of the hops. The effervescent beer quickly transitions to its spicy, bitter, extremely dry, grapefruit pithy finish that lingers super long on the palate. It's crazy that this beer is 8.5% ABV. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and I would have believed you if you told me that this is 6.0% ABV. The &quot;funkiness&quot; is reserved and I don't get any off those off-putting medicinal flavors that sometimes come along with other farmhouse ales.\n\nFeel: The carbonation is perfect and the body is medium. Nice mouthfeel.\n\nOverall: What a great hoppy American saison. It's awesome that this beer is so good and so accessible, coming from a brewery with such wide distribution as Boulevard. I do think that I prefer this beer when it is fresher. Even still, it is solid and it has developed a different character with a bit of age on it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This brew boasts a pale gold color and a huge, frothy off-white head. The nose is extremely hoppy -- excessively so for a saison. The carbonation is perfect and the high ABV is not evident on the palate. I love the base beer here; the malt &amp; yeast characteristics are a joy. The heavy, IPA-style hopping, however, is a major distraction. If the hopping were significantly reduced and/or reliant upon, say, German hops, I'd love this beer. As it is, the brew strikes me as a confusion between an IPA and a saison.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 10/14/21 On tap at Tacos and Tattoos in Kendall, FL (outside Miami) $9 for 12 oz, but what a great beer. Beautiful golden color.

Outstanding!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1620\nTank 7\nBoulevard Brewing\nDate: Enjoy by 3 Oct 2021\nI am trying the top ten of every style, and this one landed on my radar. The Pour created a frothy and creamy white head with excellent retention. The slow dissipation left gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, pale straw with amber hues. Yeasty particles prevent clarity. \n\nThe aromas are funky farmhouse, straw, a touch of horse blanket, earthiness, floral esters, a touch of cloves, and herbal notes. \n\nI taste a touch of horse blanket, cloves, toasted crackers, bready, floral esters, oranges, white pepper, herbal, straw, and a touch of farmhouse funk. \n\nThe mouthfeel is somewhat dry and a touch spicy. \n\nThe body is medium-light, has medium carbonation, and has a lingering finish. \n\nThe beer has the hallmark flavors and aromas of a great saison. Tasty beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (12oz bottle into tulip glass) \nL: Gold orange in color. 1.5 finger white bubbly soapy white head. Not the stickiest lacing but it’s present. \n\nS: very strong clove, floral, and fruit notes. Particularly ginger orange, and grapefruit. Clean hops smell, malt sweetness. Zesty. A little barnyard yeast, not much. \n\nT: Once again the floral and fruity notes are first. Grapefruit and a tiny bitter tang from the hops. Clove. The alcohol is hidden well. Peppery finish. Not heavy on the barnyard yeast notes.\n\nM: medium bodied. Middling in terms of carbonation compared to Belgian saisons, which is not particularly a bad thing. Very refreshing, pleasant finish. \n\nO: Impressed by this one. It’s big on the floral and fruit notes, more orange/grapefruit rather than lemon zest in my opinion. Could use some more “farmhouse” feel but I’ll be buying more of these.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very good ale. This is my first saison, so i wasnt expecting the hoppyness, but it was a nice surprise. There is a slight banana flavor from the wheat. It has a nice creamy texture and makes for a very easy drinker. If it wasnt $4 a bottle i could down 4-6 no problem. Boulevard has been doing a great job with there beers, and this is another home run.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The best saison/farmouse ale ever, IMO. Notes of spices - clove, pepper. Banana aroma from the wheat. Crispy, funky, spicy notes assault the senses and the high ABV ensures you'll just have one -- or will you?\n\nOf course, with all that yeast and wheat, the head pour is gigantic so pour tenderly and carefully and you will be rewarded ten-fold. The aftertaste is great and my burps were delicious following the first glass. A very unique beer, I've never tried anything that comes close except for a homebrew a friend of mine did years and years ago.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This thing smells sweet, sour and funky.\n\nIt tastes yeasty with all sorts of funkiness. No malts, no hops, just funky yeast flavors.\n\nIt's thin and smooth with a lot of carbonation. The finish is sweet for a second, then long and bitter.\n\nOverall it's a blast. Unlike other saisons, there is nothing fruit forward. Just the funk. It's good. I give it a 5.4 out of 6.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle, wine glass, best by 12/10/21. \n\nWhat a beautiful beer; golden color and a massive four finger billowy head that has stellar retention, we're talking a finger plus of meringue consistency bubbles. Needless to say, there's lacing. \n\nYeast spice presenting as coriander and other spices. Grapefruit, a little light malt sweetness, and ending a dry and slightly peppery. \n\nLightly sweet malt flavors, crisp, and peppery dry from yeast, hops, and alcohol. White pepper, yellow grapefruit zest, chamomile. It's moderate bitterness combines with a spice and hop bitterness to make a wonderfully refreshing beer. \n\nCrisp and effervescent with medium-high carbonation. \n\nI was surprised that I hadn't reviewed this before. It is a fantastic beer and Saison. It's well balanced, crisp, on the dry side, and has delicious elements of yeast, hops, and malt.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden yellow clear with light fading white cap head. Belgium notes mixed with easy breezy Saison make this a really nice summer brew with grapefruit peppery hoppy bites with a good 8.5% ABV left hook."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Well, the first beer I ever had, at 15 or 16 (now 26) with my dad should be the first beer I can conveniently review right now; having had it before from a bottle, can, tap, and my own little mini keg (which is awesome to have if your place can get them), from a glass bottle into an American pint glass, the review is as follows:\nF: Almost too crispy, and really likes to sticks to the upper back of the throat. Feels like something an elf would make, like more magic was used to make it carbonated than the yeast process itself. Too much, really. I cannot even tell when it's gotten warm.\nL: Pale straw, and I'd be suspicious of the person who sold me this &quot;gold&quot;. It lost its head (probably due to being my first official review) but she's an easy pour. Foam should level out almost perfectly if poured right, but don't expect her to stick around at all. Yeasty bubble rafts stuck around a bit.\nT: The taste is right there, and gone the very next. Sweet notes of this hoppy spark lingers slightly in the back of the throat, probably because it's hop extract. It does taste European, I'll give it that. Consistent taste, bit stronger as it gets warm; too warm and it's just mossy river water.\nS: Slight skunk with American ocean water in the morning.\n\nO: Sluggish buzz/drunk. It's just a beer with a different style, enough so it's unique from the others. Absolutely worth a try, and worth getting a mini keg. Would I bring this stuff to a party without a cool theme? Probably not.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev If it hasn't been skunked, then it's pretty tasty. It's a little too expensive for what it is though.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 7/12/21\n\nI’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it\n\nPours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather\n\nOh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla\n\nA medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%\n\nWell this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reddish brown liquid, off-white, slightly pinkish head that diminishes quickly. Dark fruit and oak fills the flavor profile, derivative of the Cabernet aging. A slight tartness like red wine vinegar, but also currants and berries. Delicious and complex, as the flavors unfold from first taste to finish.",

Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.\nM: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.\nO: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1598\nConsecration\nRussian River Brewing\nDate: 05 November 2020\nAnother sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present. \n\nThe aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical. \n\nThe flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky. \n\nThe mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering\n\nThe body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish. \n\nThis sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep amber with a cream colored head. \n\nSour and sharp with notes of leather and tobacco rounded by floral and wood. \n\nSour, leather, tobacco, up front with notes of citrus &amp; lime. A sharp sour punch, finishes dry and woody",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev What else can you say about this? Lively, funky, bright, full flavored, complex, refreshing... This is a great sour ale with a beautiful amber russet color. Carbonation is moderate and provides nice effervescence. The taste follows the nose perfectly with currant and bretty funkiness. So easy to drink at 10% abv. No real rough edges here. An excellent beer that few would find controversial.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Shared bottle, RBNAG 2011. Barrel aged 6 months, with currants added. Reddish brown colour. Intense farmhouse aroma, sour fruit, oak and spices. Sour flavour, good but not impressive.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is an excellent A+++ premium Beer all the way!\n*Aroma- Oak, Red Wine, Sour Ale/Yeast\n*Looks: Dark Sour Ale, good head\n*Taste: BEST. Oaky, leather, sour, black current, subtle cabernet wine notes, malty but super light/refreshing. Not heavy by any means. Super super easy to drink! Be careful with this since the drinkability is out of the charts and hides 10% alcohol so well. This is the best American Sour/Wild Ale that gives the world-class Belgian Sour Ales a run for their money! Although expensive at $15.99 a bottle, this Beer is not to be missed by any Beer lover. The alcohol at 10% is so damn well hidden. As the great JR from the erstwhile WWF would put” By God! This is the best American Beer. The taste, the alcohol goes from your mouth to your brain to the spine and gets you the best buzz on God’s Green Earth. Consecration 3:16...” \n*Overall*: 5/5 for me. This beer along side Pliny The Younger and Stone Enjoy By series should be declared National Treasures!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I understand that many brewmasters won’t even step foot in RR’s facility because they use Brettanomyces in this work of art but By God! this is the type of stuff no good beer advocate should ever live their entire life without trying at least once!\n\nBrown. Red. Dark. Seductive. And down right smoooooth. This Wild Sour is second to none in America as far as I’m concerned. Folks in CA and PA: don’t take it for granted!\n\nWord to the wise — Make the trip to Russian River, do yourself a favor and drop the $25 on 12 oz. bottle reserve. They’ll show you what you’ve been missing in your sour ale quest."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great beer highly drinkable ... beware if you get skunky ones ... make sure to buy in the 12 pack box .. dont allow alot of light to hit it ... they become skunky when the hops go bad with light ... should be smooth tasting with no skunk flavor.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Clear light yellow with a fizzy white head that swells some and quickly settles, leaving minimal lacing behind\nAroma: Corn, light bready notes, cereal grains, some skunky wafts, and a very light floral note\nTaste: Starts grains and bread before corn along with the lightstruck/skunk note shows up and mingles. Floral note is very subtle but noticeable some after the initial grain and skunk hit subsides as well as being prominent on the close\nMouthfeel: Light, decent body – not too watery, medium-high carbonation, and a crisp finish with zero dryness\nOverall: This is okay. A solid and decently refreshing cerveza without a ton of corn aroma/flavor and though most folks, myself included, know and feel the skunkiness is a flaw, I’ve always kind of dug it since I dig the skunky notes of hops’ cousin plant. Easy enough to drink",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light yellow beer that tastes like skunked water. Doesn't taste as syrupy cheap as a Budweiser level brew, but for the price you could do way better. A beer that's only succeeded on the strength of its beach brew advertising scheme. It's light, the taste is mostly inoffensive water with a hint of grains, but the flavorless quality only highlights the skunk.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev great beer. sure you can get the so called 'skunkiness' in the clear bottle but to me its not a totally undesirable taste therfore i would rate this beer above all of the American mass produced lagers such as bud, Coors, miller. pretty much on the same playing filed as other mass produced Mexican lagers (Modelo, Dos Equis), and mass produced European lagers (Heineken, Stella).",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev In an ever changing world, corona remains the same. The bottle looks great in instagram pictures when youre on the beach and the bottle feels great in your hand.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Crystal clear pale gold with a modest head. Corn and cereal nose, fairly clean. Mild malt body, faint flavour but nicely crisp. Ok for what it is.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nah, I passed this beer up well before the Covid pandemic. They put lime in it to cover it up. This is a summer lager and a bad one at that. Clear bottle means if you leave it out in the sun it will get funky too. Every possible way to ruin beer was invented by this company. Save this for the cinco de mayo idiot who shows up at your party for tacos and fiesta.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm not going to rave about how great this beer is, because it's not. But it's certainly not awful, either. It will pair decently with Mexican food, but this beverage will not be a memorable experience along any meal that accompanies it. The initial taste replicates a respectable brew and a spicy/bitterness follows each sip. It is nothing more than an average beer and anyone expecting more will frankly be disappointed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer is extremely overrated and nothing special. Enjoy it with a lime on a sunny afternoon if anything."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Honey colored with no head to speak of. Nose is slightly sweet, but also a bit pungent. Tasting is where the magic happens. Bitter is the best adjective available, but it is great bitterness that follows through the entire palate. Great beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1554\n\nMy continuation for beers I usually would not consume. The beer is 44 degrees and served in an IPA glass. The pour created a two-fingered off-white head. The head retention is excellent; it slowly dissipated, leaving some lacing on the glass. An amber yellow with orange hues, charting around SRM 7. This beer is clear with some carbonation bubbles. \n\nI first smell floral esters, pine, herbal, and biscuits. Nosing further, I recognize lightly toasted malts, grapefruit, a hint of dankness, a touch of mango, and pineapple. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are floral esters, pine resin, herbal, biscuity, lightly toasted malts, pineapple, and grapefruit.\n\nThe mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish. \n\nAn excellent IPA Full flavor and bright.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I first fell in love with this beauty while sipping on a pint in a Mexican-American restaurant in downtown Ithaca back in '16. A great IPA with carefully balanced malt and hops. ABV is slightly strong but not too boozy.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Brownish red color with a half inch of light tan head. The nose is chocolate, toasted whole wheat bread, rye, wet grain, and a touch of coffee. The taste is almond toffee, brown bread, molasses, hazelnuts with the skin on, roasted corn, and a delicious maltiness. Very nicely balanced beer that goes from mildly sweet to barely dry to a light lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is a pleasant creaminess that borders on chewy. The key here is the malty grainy toffee taste. This is a very good drinkable beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very good beer, complex and chewy, woodsy flavors of maple syrup, raisin, butterscotch, cocoa, toasted bread, caramel, vanilla, licorice. The expected sweetness for the style is nicely balanced by a touch of bitterness and even a hint of minty pine as the flavors linger. Excellent smooth rich feel, thick but not sticky, with a great jolt of lively fizz. My personal favorite of the Scotch ales. A malt monster, not for hopheads. An excellent beer as close to flawless as I've had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The best!!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, nut, cocoa, and dark fruits. Taste is sweet of cola and dark cherries, nutty roasted malts and a definite smoked flavor. Some marshmallow as well. Nice medium chewy mouthfeel. Alcohol is held in check by the full malt flavors and overall this is a nice ale.",

This is the last of a 4-pack that I bought in late 2020.\n\nPours a muddied brownish-amber colour, with a deliberately rough pour producing half an inch of foamy beige head. It leaves behind a thin collar, but little else worth mentioning - though a good swirl does leave some spotty lacing and legs behind. Mostly just sweet on the nose - lots of caramel and toffee, with notes of cherry red licorice candy, dates and figs; these obscure subtler suggestions of toasted bread, molasses, plum and alcohol.\n\nA fine beer, indeed - complex and flavourful, though the scales are certainly tipped toward the 'malt' side of the equation, with an almost fruit cake-like flavour at the forefront. There's caramel, toffee, toasted bread and molasses, as well as cherry, prune, date and fig; hints of cocoa and smoked malt at the finish, leading in to a slightly warming aftertaste with lingering hints of toffee, earthiness and dark fruits, as well as a touch of booziness. Medium in body, with relatively low carbonation levels that weakly brush against the surface of the tongue; feels smooth and a little slick on the palate. If you've got more than one can, you might want to pace yourself - it's easy to pour down the hatch, but as Samuel Jackson once said, it'll get'cha drunk.\n\nFinal Grade: 4.2, an awesome A-. Old Chub has been on my wants list for a couple years, and I'm thrilled to strike it off. I don't know if this is the best scotch ale I've ever had - it's tasty for sure, with a varied array of flavours, and the 8% is exceedingly well-integrated. That being said, the smoked malt aspects are fairly subtle, and overall it's a little sweet for my tastes - minor flaws for this style, of course, if they can even be considered flaws in the first place. If you see this beer and are in any way curious, do not hesitate to purchase it - I'll be doing so again at the first opportunity.",

Earthy, smoky, toasty, grainy flavor, a touch of licorice, more caramel sweetness. Finally, at the very back of the palate, a modest amount of floral hops.

Mostly tastes like a big, sweet brown ale, but hints of the scotch ale come back in the back end.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber with a tiny head that dissolved pretty quickly, however, there was some nice lacing left behind. \n\nSmells mainly of caramel malts, toffee, coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit.\n\nThis brew evolved as it warmed, initially when it was cold I was only able to pick up the caramel and the coffee up front with a hint of the dark fruit, but the latter flavors and aroma came alive once it warms up. When it warms it approaches cloying, however I am completely fine with that because sweet beers are my thing. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty tasty brew, cheers! Only thing that's somewhat disappointing is that I'm not picking up much of the smokiness. I paired this with lamb chops.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer pours pretty dark brown. Reminiscent of dark cola. Is has a half inch head that fades slowly. The leaving hand on all the way through. Smell is typical dark ale, carmel notes maybe a little cocoa. Then drinking it, this is fantastic. Like a flavor boquet in your mouth. There is something lingering that I tried to discern. About halfway through I figured it out! Cherries. A faint but noticable taste of cherries. One thing to notice, there are some sort of solids floating in the glass. Not sure what they are. Visible in both that I have had from the 6 pack. Not too concerned though because the flavor is great. I'll keep buying this one for sure.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Simply Beautiful. Deep clear amber that makes you want to dive right in. Which I did.\nSmell and taste: Smokey Malt. At 8% ABV there is a ever so slight booziness. \nFeel: Warm to the soul. Sweet on the tongue with a little bitterness left on the palate.\nOverall: What a pleasant brew. Had this one many times and have never been disappointed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark mahogany color with red reflections, very creamy cream-colored cap with a discreet persistence. Scent, bread crust, caramel, chocolate, licorice, light smoked. The drink reflects the olfactory sensations, the malts dominate with a sweet gentle path balanced by a delicate final bitterness on herbaceous tones and by the solid ABV. The body is very soft and round and the carbonation is low.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 12/16/20 &amp; consumed 3/7/21: Slight sweet malt nose; amber hue with tan lace; medium mouthfeel with very soft carbonation; taste has a medium bitter caramel malt taste that transcends to a dry placid finish.

After a few minutes, cracker malt and grassy hops come through.\nT: Crackery malt, grassy hops, then slight bitterness in the lingering finish.\nM: Fairly light body, medium carbonation.\nO: Haven't had a Pilsner in a while, been on the PA/IPA/DIPA train. Definitely a crisp change.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Labeled German Style Pilsner. Look and feel is pilsner and acceptable within the style. But, all I taste from this beer is grassy hops. To call it a German pilsner, this falls short by Victory. They need to sample Warsteiner, Wernesgruner, Spatan, Bitburger, Paulaner, Kulmbacher, etc. Mexico made Bohemia Pilsner is a far better German pilsner than Victory Pils. That said, it is a decent American pilsner if you are looking to scratch that itch.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.3%. Clear golden colour, moderate to low white head. Nice aroma of floral, grassy and herbal hops, some sweetish malts in the background. Medium sweet and malty flavour, followed by distinct herbal hops. A good pilsener indeed, but some European ones are better.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a bottle, pours a mostly clear yellow with a thin white quickly dispersing head. Pronounced aroma of floral hops and lemon. Tastes is a crisp bitter hops, plus grassy citrus (perhaps grapefruit) tang, plus, sweet malt. All this with refreshing carbonation and flavors that 'sustain'. Nice.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The beer is a crisp straw color with a good head that really lasts for a while. The malt and spicey hops are on the nose with lemon notes. On the palate, the beer is is sweet with herbal, spicey and lemon hop notes. It is well balanced. The mouth feel is fry and bubbly but the two don't mix here well. Overall, a decent pilsner but not great.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours an almost clear straw color with a short lived head and some light lacing. \n\nSmells and tastes of bready malt and floral hops. At first sips have a mildly bitter finish. As the glass warms floral tastes come out. \n\nLight body and medium carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle, tulip, best by 11/23/20. \n\nLight golden beer and a white sticky head that together just look crisp. \n\nSweet cracker malt, mowing sweet grass, and a whiff of sulphur. \n\nThe initial taste is corn and crackers. That sweet corn remains an undertone to very floral, sweet grassy hops that carry me through to a slightly herbal, crisp finish. \n\nRather a full body, but crisp with plenty of carbonation. \n\nFor some reason I had always thought this was a bohemian pilsner, probably because it’s hoppier than most German pils, which is also what makes it more to my liking.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Kinda reminds me of blue moon",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours very golden, 4 finger head. Nose is overpowering European hops. Taste follows, a bit too much hoppyness to be considered balanced. Nonetheless, it is still a good beer.\n\nEdit: Having had this side by side to other pilsners, this falls far short. Overly hopped, not nearly enough malt in the base to balance the absurd amount of hops. Simply too hop forward to quench the thirst or even simply enjoy. This drinks more like a pale ale or india pale lager. The high rating on this and other sites simply means the reviewers around here just like overly hopped liquids. This is not a good example of a pilsner, let alone a german pils.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance, is yellow and fizzy with a large white head. Strong aroma of floral hops. Taste is unusual, fruity hops that are strong and insistent, like a hope taste in a pale ale rather than a pils, body is thick, mouthfeel is smooth and dry. For me this is too much like a lagery IPA for my liking, possibly more like an IPL but I wouldn't describe it as a proper pils. Whilst it's a nice enough drink the hop bitterness takes away from the refreshment aspect."

Less black malt, earthy notes, and root beer. \n\nOverall: This one surpassed my expectations. What a beer. Intense chocolate, espresso roast, but goes down smooth and clean enough to make you long for another sip. Definitely a sipper and hides the alcohol extremely well at 10.2% (Final Rating: 4.40)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours black with a medium persistent rich tan head. Smell is roasted malt, some coffee notes, maybe even a little dark fruit. Taste has a big sweet backbone but it's overwhelmed by the bitter roasted malt. Great malt profile that's hard to place. Dark chocolate and coffee notes, but that's a bit of a cop out to describe what's a more complicated malt taste. Spicy warming boozy finish. The most noteworthy thing here is how surprisingly balanced and drinkable this is. Heavy for sure, but it goes down dangerously easy. Nicely carbonated. Really great imperial stout and a great beer for a cold January evening.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle poured into Teku glass. Picked up from liquor store for $2.79. 8/13/21 printed on the top of the back label, so this is about 4 months old. \n\nAppearance - Opaque black body. Medium brown 2-finger head with good retention, lacing and stick. 4.75\n\nSmell - Dark roasted character primarily. Then some caramel and chocolate and vanilla, and alcohol. It really doesn't hide the alcohol very well. 4.25\n\nTaste - Dark roasted coffee. I just now read the description on the back label and it literally says word for word &quot;dark roasted coffee&quot;. So yeah, it sure lives up to that. Baker's cocoa noticeable too, as it notes. It's not bad by any means. But this style has very stiff competition, and I rate within style. 4\n\nMouthfeel - A little harsh. Boozy. Full bodied. But a relatively clean finish for the style, which isn't saying too much. 4\n\nOverall - Pretty solid beer. Pretty middle of the road for the style. No major flaws. Easy recommendation, especially for the price. Good value. 4",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'm not (yet) much of a stout guy, having cut my teeth first of IPAs and, more recently, sours. But beer is an adventure, so here we are!\n\nSierra Nevada straddles the line between craft and macro pretty well. I've been disappointed by their limited edition IPAs, which lean heavily into the bitter without much balance. But I was pleasantly surprised by the Narwhal. A very sippable stout with a deeply roasted flavor that never crosses the line into burnt. Strong but not overpowering. Dark as sin with a light head.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce bottle packaged on 8/21/2020 poured into a DFH tulip. Thick tan head over an inky brown body. Smell was of malts, chocolate, molasses and char. Taste followed the nose. Mouthfeel was very creamy whether from cellaring for a year or maybe just natural. I can see why others hold this in such high regard. An excellent Russian Imperial Stout which will be present in my cellar going forward.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I can't say much that hasn't been said, so cutting to the chase this is a very good RIS deserving of the rating. \n\nIt pours a thick looking oily black, very clear. \n\nThe smell is of chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, char, molasses and I think just a hint of licorice.\n\nWhat I find surprising in the taste is the chocolate, but this is fresh and I look forward to letting this age and seeing how it changes, but right now I am getting a significant chocolate flavor, that seems slightly sweet at first but as the coffee and roasted malt takes over, the sweet sensation fades to a hefty but short-lived combo bite of char, espresso, acridity, and some bitterness. Coffee acridity and char lingers a little, but pleasantly. \n\nEven young, no alcohol beyond a pleasant warmth. I'd call it medium body, somewhat creamy, just enough carbonation to hold it up. Glad I have five more to play with later, anticipating this to be even better with some time.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cheapest quality craft beer drunk that isn’t an ipa. I imagine this would taste amazing aged a few years. Unfortunately it tastes a little bland for the style fresh and the alcohol taste is definitely stronger. Overall great for what it is.",

A pour into a pint glass left a gorgeous 1-1/4 inch foamy head, which held never fully depleted, and left a perfect, relentless trail of lacing. This brew is black as midnight! The taste? This is my kind of beer.. Solid bourbon over coffee and chocolate, subtle vanilla/ rum/ molasses sweetness.. robust decadence. More than a bit of booziness, Sierra Nevada is not for the fainthearted, uninitiated, or nouveau drinker. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy , too sticky.. and the aftertaste is all bourbon. But if you like a good stiff beer, this one's for you!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, shared by gunnar. Pitch black colour, moderate to low brown head. Nice aroma of chocolate / cocoa, molasses and coffee. Same elements in the flavour, add a little liquorice and decent hops, and you’re there. Good stuff.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Black with a tan head that is rather impressive for an imperial stout. Aroma is mostly chocolate &amp; coffee, maybe some caramel too. Slightly sweet with a hint of bitter. Lots of chocolate &amp; coffee flavor followed by some complex malt &amp; hop flavors. The coffee type bitterness seems to increase the more it is consumed. No alcohol flavor but mild stomach heat. Velvety smooth with good carbonation. Delicious!",

You immediately know what to do ; you traipse back inside to their fridge and crack a Smutty. The Finest Kind. Notes of pine and grass complete the symphony; the briskness of arriving autumn tapered by the flowing IPA approaching your extremities... warmth. You don’t just feel home, you ARE home.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours... well I don't know. I had 3 of them within their own cans. The aroma is hop-forward with a hint of citrus, maybe pineapple?

Leaves no trace of lace.\n\nBouquet:\nA hushed duet of semi-sweet hops and tiny speckles of pineapple. Fresh citrus cuts in front of these quiet performers, playing a lurid yet catchy jazz solo which nearly tunes them out. \n\nFeel:\nA slick, medium body with a nearly impalpable booze finish that has the gentle warmth of a springtime sunrise. The carbonation plays a subtle yet imperative, supporting role. \n\nTaste:\nA drizzle of pineapple syrup over a fistful of tangy, citrus hops. Any potential acidic bitterness is bumped out of the picture by a biscuity, malt backbone.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a translucent copper with two fingers of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is sticky, resiny, floral, citrusy hops with a hearty biscuity, bready malt backbone. 'Oldschool' IPA vibes, but in the best of ways. Balance is clean. Flavor profile is resiny, floral, citrusy hops in a sticky mash-up. Biscuity and bready malts offer up some support and relief to the hop bite. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy texture.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Gave the look a four because it looks like a Newcastle Brown Ale. However, my understanding is that this is now a Lagunitas product. Combined with the recipe change five or six years ago, the firm’s obstinate refusal to do away with the clear glass that ruins the beer and selling out to macro garbage like Lagunitas, this is undrinkable swill. One of the admonishments from BA is that we’re supposed to be respectful of the brewer. That statement is obviously ridiculous, taken out of context. I understand the idea behind it though. As such, I didn’t give it straight ones.\nI have had Newcastle Brown Ale in not a few pubs across the pond, as far back as 1997. Reviewing that beer would be a wonderful time. Drinking this (er, taking two swallows and pouring out the rest) was such a departure from those halcyon days, I may have unconsciously used this beer as a stand in for my deep regret of having returned to the Disneyland Freakshow States of Oligopoly. \nWhatever the case, this is tragic. No, this was never the finest beer. But it was relatively inexpensive and decent (out of a keg) - pretty much the opposite of whatever this is.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drank this so much and so often in the 90s I certainly tried, and failed, to replicate it when I took up brewing. Wasn't even close, enjoy one very now and again, but of course there's better browns about these days.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark brown look with a nice foamy beige head that recedes to a ring. Ruby look in light. Malty smell, rye bread smell, New York bagel hints. Low bitterness taste with a bready, malty, low low hip taste. Pretty bland. Watery but still vicious feel in your mouth. No super creamy, but not super citrusy. Middle of the road beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I still remmeber stealing a few of these out of my dad's minifridge to bring to a neighbor girl's house, swigging it while grimacing, pretending to like it...\n\nIt's a supremely bland take on the brown ale, with tons of budweiser flavor and none of the savory goodness a true brown ale should have. Gutter tripe",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My Favorite Brown.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev They can do better. The first time I made my own beer for a youtube video, I made a kit called &quot;back to basics beer&quot; It was nothing fancy, 6.6 pounds of DME, some copper colored grain in a bag some hops and Nottingham yeast packet. My beer, with mistakes I made like squeezing the bag, stirring the wort, not mixing the priming sugar with hot water and some other rookie mistakes, my beer came out tasting better than a New Castle Brown Ale. NCBA is good with making beer bread with it, but not drinking it. This is just okay I prefer Bass Ale over NCBA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev What could they possibly have been thinking when Lagunitas turned Newcastle into this syrupy brown pablum of an excuse for a beer? This was a unique ale in almost every way, but foremost in flavor and texture. Now it is entirely unremarkable. Avoid this like the plague if you are expecting anything like what this justly famous ale was known for.",

Two-finger quick-to-dissipate tan head.\nS - Bready, nutty. Some biscuit and toast notes. Slight pepper on the back.\nT - Caramel. Toast. Pumpernickel bread. A slight sweetness, but not sweet overall.\nF - Extremely carbonated. Refreshing. Despite the color, it's light in body.\nO - I would say this beer sets a certain bar for a certain type of beer that's cheap, satisfying to drink, and goes well with every meal. Not a bad beer in the slightest, but I wish it had more of a bitterness to it. On the pricier end of the spectrum for a macrobrew, but I wouldn't mind getting this every so often. Would recommend trying at least once.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (Bottle). A good but somewhat overrated beer. Aggressively carbonated. Better in the Good Old Days when it was stronger.\n\nRerate, draught in Newcastle: I found the colour to be darker brown than the bottled version (can that be?), and the flavour was fuller and richer - even though the pub tried to ruin it by serving it ice cold.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Newcastle, 12oz. bottle poured into my weizen glass(20oz.) starts with a nice three finger head of a light tan foam. After several minutes it did settle back to a thin cap with a bit of lacing left behind. This ale is a dark brown that is somewhat orange when held up to the light. This beer is clear, so I can observe the moderate carbonation cascade up.\nThe aroma is light bready malts.\nThe flavor starts with a crispness up front, the light hops, giving way to sweet caramel malt flavor.\nThe feel is light, a bit thin.\nThis is an easy one to drink, the flavor is ok, the feel is light. I wish I would have one of the originals to see what all the fuss is about! !",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is not Newcastle brown! Please alter the name as you have completely altered and ruined my favorite brown ale! Because you have done this I will not be drinking Brown Sugga,Pilsner, lil Sumpthin, or any beer offered as a Lagunitas product. Thanks for somewhat destroying a part of my beer experience!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is not Newcastle Brown. Have some respect for a brand that has been around since 1927. Awesome, you own it now, Langunitas. Free enterprise at it's finest but if you're going to completely change the recipe at least have the decency to change or at least alter the name to 2.0 or remix or something. To all of the basically kids that are giving the lol to people like me, you just don't get it. I've been drinking Newcastle since the early 90's. You may as well hand me a bud light and say &quot;here's your newkey&quot;. NO IT'S NOT. This is not about whether or not this beer is any good. If you like it then fantastic. The point is you can't just fancy up the label and call it the same thing. Have some respect for the brand. I personally will not buy another Langunitas product again and that's my choice.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a deep ruby amber color that is dark, but some clarity. Moderate tan head. SRM of 20. (3.75)\n\nAroma: Moderate aromas of baked nuts, brown bread, with hints of caramel. A bit of A1 Steak Sauce on the aroma too. (3.75)\n\nFlavor: The flavor follows with more brown bread, baked pecans, walnuts, cashews, lightly laced with caramel. Malty, but rather dry at the end. Has sort of a Roast Beef flavor too. (3.50)\n\nFeel: Lighter bodied. Moderate carbonation. Finishes clean. (4.00)\n\nCompared to Get Up Offa Dat Brown 1/18/21: Pours a similar color with a larger head. More brown bread, nuts, and ester flavors. More steak sauce and roast beef. Less malty. I'd say it leans a bit more English. \n\nOverall: A pretty good brown ale. Has some hints of fruit esters that I percieved as A1 Steak Sauce. I also detect a bit of a roast beef flavor here. ... I call it how I see it.\nBut nevertheless, it has nice brown bread and baked nuts flavors. Also has a decent amount of carbonation to give it a nice body and keep it dry. Drinks quite nice and I would say pretty standard for an English Brown Ale. (Final Rating: 3.68)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours from bottle a light mahogany, solid 2&quot; inch head, lots of lacing left behind throughout the drink. Nose isn't too powerful, but notes of caramel and earthy hops. Taste tilts more towards those earthy hops than I remember from pre-Lagunitas bottles, but as it warms and on the finish, the maltier caramel elements poke through a bit more. Mouthfeel is full and creamy."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.5 oz bottle notched 1 0 2 (my research shows this is a batch number and means nothing) poured into teku glass at fridge temp 9.5% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with just a hint of light penetration around the edges. The head (or lack thereof) never fully develops and presents as the finest, razor thin ring around the glass. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring coffee and a hint of booze. The taste is bittersweet coffee, chocolate and slight oxidation. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, there's not a lot of life left in this bottle. I wish this beer was still imported. I would try fresh given the opportunity. Scores are skewed up as this bottle was just purchased off a room temperature shelf this week and has clearly suffered.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.5 oz bottle, born on 9/18/19, poured into a snifter at 52 degrees F:\nL - black with a hazelnut head that lingered\nS - coffee, chocolate, roasted malt\nT - very dry, malt flavor with coffee and a bit of chocolate on the finish\nF - thick mouthfeel, very dry, little carbonation\nO - Fabulous beer, very dry with strong bold flavors of coffee and roasted malt",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Taste of dark roasted coffee is up front along with roasted malts that have a burnt-toasted character and a nice bitterness that lingers, but not too long. Nice imperial stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 341 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 9.5%. Black colour, moderate tan head. Aroma of coffee, roast malts and dark chocolate. Rich flavour, but not too sweet, notes of roast malts and strong coffee, also plenty of bittering hops. Hints of dark bitter chocolate and unsweetened liquorice. Good beer, but not as outstanding as expected.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev WOW. This beer is really something special.\nLooks like any other deep black imperial stout does. Beautiful black in colour with small brown head, leaves some lacing.\nSmells like roasted malt with some subtle dark roast coffee. Very inviting.\nThe taste of this beer is amazing. Nice roasted malt, caramel malt, coffee, and some vanilla maybe in the back. Some chocolate notes and brown sugar are present as well and it's all very well balanced. I didn't notice any of the fruit notes other people have reported. I drank the bottle in like 2 minutes without even noticing so this is definitely a dangerous drinker.\nThe mouthfeel was quite pleasant and full bodied. Doesn't coat the mouth but has that medium-full body with light-medium carbonation.\nOverall at $14 for 4 bottles this beer is insane. This is the best overall Canadian beer I've ever found and I love Dieu du Ciel. Such a great beer and huge recommend for anyone with access to it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good looking Imperial Stout.\n\nSmell: Roasted malts, moderate coffee and some very mild brown sugar notes. The coffee and the roasted malts are the star here.\n\nTaste: The taste profile features prominent coffee and roasted malt notes, and some very faint brown sugar notes. The finish is fairly dry featuring the roast malts and coffee notes lingering to the end. The beer has a mild alcohol presence.\n\nMouth-feel: Medium bodied with a generous level of carbonation. Not the thickest stout but it still has a good mouthfeel.\n\nOverall: A good coffee stout. The flavor profile is that of a prototypical stout with a real roasted malt backbone plus a nice coffee presence. A good pastry stout is tasty but sometimes it's good to go back to the basics.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased based on a rave review from Foss Co. in Golden, an accolade to take very seriously. Still, at $5/12 oz I wasn't expecting something quite this ... exceptional. By appearance it's an average imperial stout, jet black with a thin tan head, but oh wow. The reviewer who called it &quot;something like hard cold brew&quot; pretty much nailed it. Delicately chocolaty and dark fruity, with a seamlessly integrated bitterness upon a clean but comforting body. An elegant palette of bold and beautiful flavors that never overstay their welcome. (By the way, hard cold brew does exist, and it's disgusting.)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a bottle that looks to be dated about 4 years old. Black as night with minimal chocolate milk head leaving scant lacing ,appears rather flat. Nose is muted coffee,smoky roasty malt and a bit of sweetness. Taste is mostly smoky with a slight bitterness. Interesting. Finishes almost like an espresso but drier and woody.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Black with compact and persistent hazelnut head. Scent of chocolate, coffee, toasts, vanilla, smoked wood, dark fruits, sweet ethyl bourbon note. Beginning with chocolate cake, plum and then coffee, roasting and hoppy finish. Aftertaste rich in roasts and alcoholic notes with herbaceous persistence. Medium / high and creamy body, low carbonation. Very balanced and elegant drink. Delicious.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Received on trade with @MATTS2896. \nYou've heard of hard iced tea, yes? For Peche Mortel, think hard cold-brewed coffee (if there were such a thing. Who knows, maybe there is).\nA - Like coffee, with a slight khaki head\nS - Cold brew coffee, with some molasses stirred in\nT - More complex than the nose. The coffee blends with roasty (something, maybe from the malts), raisins and licorice\nM - Medium light body, and a silkiness that is unusual in a stout that is not very heavy.\nO - the only mortal sin would be passing up the chance to consume this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev First try on this one, won’t be my last, may revise in time\n\nPoured deep brown black with a frothy two and a half finger caramel head. Head retained like a dollop of cream and was included in every sip(gulp). Beautiful foam lacing \n\nSmells incredible, a step above most coffee stouts, a punch of roasted coffee comes to the fore with subtle notes of dark fruits, raisins, dates, plums, etc. \n\nEasy Coffee bitterness, hoppy in a sense, while somehow sweet and warming. Absolutely lovely, the base imperial stout notes are there but enhanced to another level.\n\nFeels full through a pronounced head giving it a latte/cappuccino-esque umami. Rounded out while having a sting and thinness at once. Truly magical\n\nI imagine there are many more of this style that hit everyone differently, and while I (usually) never drink before 5pm, I had this one for breakfast. Absolutely perfect in the morning, though I wouldn’t suggest more than one until late afternoon. As that would be a (insert obligatory dad joke here) mortal sin"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 650 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11.0%. Pitch black colour, moderate creamy tan head. Intense aroma of cocoa / chocolate. The flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa, but the sweetness is not too extreme. Also some roasted coffee notes. A moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish (Chinook and Willamette) balances some of the chocolate sweetness. Very drinkable for an 11% beer. I had no problem finishing the bottle - but if you hate chocolate, this is clearly not a beer for you.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've had many opportunities to drink Choklat Oranj and really liked it. Had this one for a few years and thought a snowy Christmas would be a good time to drink it. Really hits the spot. I guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing it'll do. Looks like motor oil with very little head. Just like an imperial stout should. With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Slightly thick, smooth as silk and just about right. Overall, a really good imperial stout. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available any longer but should it pop up again i'm definitely getting another bottle or two",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 22oz bottle. No dating information found.\nBlack colored body, with ruby back lit highlights. Two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap. Leaves very little lacing.\nAroma is similar to a chocolate malt. Smells very sweet.\nTaste is sweet but also bittersweet, and with a little smoky char. Displays many types of chocolate, from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate. Roasted malts are there for support.\nMouth feel is about medium, but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. Good carbonation.\nThis is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate, fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. Ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a brown so deep it appears to be shoe polish black. Garnet colored when bright light is passed through it. The pour produces a strong finger of foamy, moderately lasting, mocha head that leaves a rounded surface cap, a respectable collar ring and a pasty wash of lace 1/2 inch above the collar. The presentation is above average for a higher octane Imperial Stouts. Aroma is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate... deeply roasted malts, with hints of toffee, spice, prunes and a little alcohol booze. Taste is even more chocolate. Rich dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate syrup, chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate pudding, vanilla (like Oreos and milk), something nutmeg-like and alcohol spice. Puts me in mind of a deeply chocolate eggnog (if there is such a thing). There is little alcohol booze (for the ABV) and a faint hint of dark fruit. Velvety smooth in the finish it has almost no prickle between the finish and aftertaste but the hint is there. The aftertaste is earthy, chocolate, slightly bitter, roasted and burnt. Alcohol is evident as spice, warmth, flavor and maybe bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, smooth... velvety smooth, tongue coating creamy and chewy with a very thin peppery prickle.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Christmas Eve snowfall, a fireplace and Santa bringing me a case of Southern Tier Choklat. I'm set for the winter. Great velvety feel, pours almost black. But the aroma and taste are the stars here. First, they line up. None of this smells like one thing and tastes like another. The chocolate coffee balance is perfect. At 10%abv you should be sipping this beer and frankly no matter what the abv, this beer deserves to be enjoyed slowly. Alexa. Play &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; by Nat King Cole. And tell Santa to make that two cases of Choklat.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: It pours black with a dark brown head. Head retention is moderate. \n\nSmell: The initial aroma is a strong deep dark chocolate aroma. It reminds me of a brownie as it warms a bit. \n\nTaste: This has a rich malt flavor with dark chocolate and cocoa. There is some roast and some slight burnt flavors. There is a bit of cherry in the background as well. Dark fruits are very low. \n\nFeel: It has a rich, velvet like texture that is smooth and creamy. It has a moderate amount of bitterness to it. \n\nOverall, it is a very rich, chocolate beer. The dark chocolate is the dominate flavor of the beer with some supporting elements in the background.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev As a rule, I don't drink Stouts, but my wife does and I tasted hers. This was a great beer! The main thing that got me was the taste and mouthfeel. I could taste Chocolate and Cherry with good body, and there was no lingering aftertaste that I have found with most Stouts. We were visiting in South Carolina. Wish it and their Chocolate Orange Stout was available here in Virginia.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a delicious dessert beer. Roasty coffee mixes in with a chocolate pudding sort of flavor. The beer is somewhat creamy with plenty of chocolate. Really good stuff, but a little heavy. Probably best to share or drink slowly. Not hot, just really rich."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Astounded that I have not reviewed this yet. It is the single beer that I have never fell out of favor with. Others come and go as tastes change but this one always hits the sweet spot for me.\nPours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while.\nThe aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these.\nThe taste is where this really shines. Crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip. \nThe feel is ideal for the style, I am not sure it can be improved.\nOA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all.\nReally good beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pretty good rye IPA. Dark amber color with ample white head. Rye flavored IPA with nice flavor profile and few off-putting flavors. Overall eminently drinkable—not too bitter for an IPA, not too sweet. Well rounded and well crafted.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.6%, 70 IBUs. Reddish brown colour, big and lasting off-white head. Nice aroma of floral and citrussy hops (dry hopped with Amarillo), also sweetish notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour has also notes of orange marmalade and caramel malts, but is not extremely sweet. There is a distinct hoppy bitterness towards the end, with grapefruity and resinous notes, lasting through the long aftertaste. Good stuff.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a medium-dark copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is sweet with a hint of caramel. Tastes starts out slightly spicy and finishes with a good hoppy bitterness. Good mouth feel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is my all time favorite beer, not necessarily because it's the best beer I've ever had, but for many reasons including sentimental ones, so I will try to view this as objectively as I can.\n\nPoured from a Michigan exclusive release can into an IPA glass. \n\nColor is deep caramel/red tones. Head is darker than a typical IPA and sticks to the glass like glue\n\nSmell is peppery and malty, slightly sweet. Pleasant, not overly intrusive.\n\nTaste follows the nose but much, much stronger. Peppery bite up front, followed by the sweet from the red ale characteristics. Finish is a lingering rye pepper flavor. Excellent and memorable.\n\nMedium bodied, smoother than you would expect mouthfeel. \n\nOverall, this is a delicious beer that is also interesting to drink. I'm so glad that they are packaging this beer again after a long hiatus, and consider myself lucky to be a Michigan native so that I can get this beer easily.",

According to the stamp on the can, this was canned on &quot;03.09. 200019034.&quot; Apparently, Founders has an in-house time machine, and this beer was retrieved from the era the Dune books are set in.\n\nPoured into a Mad Bomber IPA glass, this had a nice, but, fluffy, beige colored head that sat on top of a dark copper, slightly red colored beer with some nice clarity. Said head took a long time to drop and left lots of lace behind. \n\nPeppery, spicy Amarillo hop and rye malt notes greeted the workers at my olfactory. Some sweet, bready malt notes as well.\n\nTaste is spicy and peppery up front. Earthy, Rye malt flavor comes to the fore especially at the fadeout. Fairly good-sized, bready malt backbone to this, which isn't surprising given it's midwest DNA, but is not sufficiently massive to be disturbing to a PNWer like me! \n\nMedium bodied, with an almost creamy mouthfeel.\n\nReally like this. If it were local to me I'd have it in my fridge on a regular basis. Thanks, Whyteboar!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Now I'm trying to figure out a blind tasting, courtesy of a @foundersasap in our NBS BIF #9\n\nI am a little baffled by this one. \nIt's a garnet tinged amber color. Light sandy head that rises a finger or so, loosens up, and quickly recedes. (I'm assuming it would have a little more head retention had I opened earlier).\nReally pretty color.\nSmells of rye, some earthy hops, and a hint of caramel malt.\nTaste is rye, buckwheat, a tad of pine resin, with a gentle almost floral honey note. Also a smooth pepper note peeks in.\nMouthfeel is slightly less than medium. Low carbonation. Finish is a tad slick.\nOverall, I'm guessing a rye IPA, or an Amber ale with some rye in the mix.\nSo what is it?",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear deep red with short head but substantial. Very good lacing. Slight sweet citrus smell but my cold beer didn't have much aroma. Taste was outstanding, prominant smokiness cuts the hops bite and alcohol. Very well balanced."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 fl. oz. bottle, thanks to my son Steinar. ABV is 7.2%. Cloudy dark brown colour, big and creamy tan head. Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An &quot;arrogant&quot; beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reviewed from notes.\n\nPours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.\n\nThe smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.\n\nThe taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.\n\nEverything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer &quot;feels good&quot;.\n\nOverall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Oak Aging just adds to the flavor of this already powerful ale",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The &quot;oaking&quot; process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original. Starts hoppy and bittersweet but immediately increases in bitterness to finish dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lingers long in the aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev **\n06/01/2013\n\nAroma is pure hops and barley. Dark copper color, but translucent. Small white head. Thin feel. Low carbonation. A bit too strong and bitter, though I think the oaked version of this beer us a touch smoother than the original. Some good flavors, but all over the place. The pieces don’t come together here.\n\n**",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A- Probably the best write up anyone will come across on a beer bottle haha!! This pours with a great caramel colored head that is dense, starts off about a finger thick and has awesome retention. The beverage itself is muddied, brown and with plenty of visible suspended yeast particulate. The carbonation seems to be plentiful and smooth. As for lacing, it is really nice, with lots of small circular clumps of foam stickily hanging on to the side of the glass.\n\nS- First impression.....wood chips, and of campfire! Beyond this there is vanilla, slight coffee and chocolate notes, some dense dried apple, caramel and toffee sweet malts and the finish is rummy sweet yet bitter from the hops....a very nice balancing act between rich &amp; malty, oak, and bitter.\n\nT- The flavors follow suit to the aromas, with the richness of the rum coming through very well....almost liqueur like. I am getting beautiful caramel/toffee sweetness, vanilla, oak cask, some campfire smoke. The bulk of the beer is yeasty, bread like, of cream, nuttiness.....just a full spectrum of balanced goodness! \n\nM/O- Mouthfeel is creamy medium/full bodied, and the carbonation is about as smooth as one can get! I give this full marks for drinkability and I'd love nothing more than to enjoy more than one of these delectable Ales.....the alcohol is so well hidden you don't even know there is any.....what a delight to drink! Simply awesome and worthy of being one of my favorite beers!"

Very thick white head that stayed resilient for a short while. You can taste the rye backing up the hops with this one. Has a slightly different bitter background other than hops. Finishes less dry than other IPA's. Has a mild sweetness that blends well. The nose is more prominent than other in this sampler pack. Almost rustic; sweet, pleasant and malty. A darker color than usual IPA's, as to be expected with the rye. A brown color, almost like an amber beer was mixed with 1/4th west coast ipa. In the nucleated glass I poured it into, its maintained persistent carbonation bubbles rising to the top. More so than a lot of other IPA's to an extent. Not overly carbonated though. Maintains a thin, but thicker than usual lacing even minutes later. A good amount of carbonation, maybe the slightly higher end but still in a good way, as per usual with most Sierra Nevada beer's I've tried so far.\n\nOverall a tasty beer and a nice experience, coming from someone new to rye beers.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: Pours a deep brown with a brief 3 finger tan head that fades to a smooth cap. It leaves lots of soapy lacing on the sides.\n\nS: Aromas of caramel and molasses. No hop aromas.\n\nT: Taste follows the nose. And with only 15.5 IBUs, you're not going to taste any hops, either.\n\nF: Smooth with tingling carbonation, moderately full bodied. At 9% it's strong, but it's not going to knock you on your butt.\n\nO: Overall, it's a good value. An excellent take on Belgian-style strong dark, by a solid Canadian brewery. This and Maudite are probably my favorites from UniBroue.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I bought this for the Trippel tasting weekend, not sure why, but here we are. Obviously rating as a Belgian style Dark Ale.\nPoured dark, like reddish cola and managed to get about 5 mm of head of beige foam which pretty much stayed the whole time.\nThe aroma was more dark fruits like raisins and prunes; not sweet at all, very pleasant.\nThe taste followed, mouth-filling flavor of malty goodness.\nThe feel was almost viscous, which considering all the flavor and the ABV, it made perfect sense. Excellent sipper.\nThis one turned out to be a happy mistake, I'll definitely revisit it on purpose.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Globe Glass\n\nPours a murky dark mahogany color with some reddish hues, and a medium tan head that recedes quickly leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing\n\nThe aroma is sweet; consisting of cherries, raisins, dates, brown sugar, a mild spiciness, and a pronounced booziness.\n\nThe flavor follows the nose closely, with a mix raisins, plums, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of spiciness. Also, as with the nose, there is a strong booziness, but not overly strong, just enough to alert you to the 9% abv. Full bodied and moderately carbonated.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice beer that I will be revisiting",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours a cloudy, very dark brown with a finger thick head of tightly packed bubbles.\n\nAs with many of Unibroue’s offerings, they have a hallmark style with their Belgians — leans fruity, and leans on the subtler yet complex side of things. This is no different. Complex nose that is hard to pick apart the malty side, spiced fruitcake, gentle cloves, fresh dark fruits like cherry. Molasses and toffee.\n\nFlavour follows the nose pretty tightly. Alcohol is well hidden but the warmth it has adds a dimension to the flavour profile, a woody sherry like flavour. More malt here than on the nose, especially on the finish which recalls toasted bread and spongy chocolate coffered toffee and sugared apples. Bits of yeastiness wax and wane throughout your palate as you sip it.\n\nIncredible mouthfeel. It foams very, very hard in your mouth but the carbonation is not particularly prickly. This gives it a very foamy mouthfeel on the way down. Medium bodied beer that is relatively sweet, no real bitterness here. Medium-high level of carbonation, especially noticeable in that sip, but the carbonation is not overly biting. Nice subtle but long finish leaving a gentle sweetness, yeasty grains, and dark fruits on the palate.\n\nAs mentioned before, I find almost all of Unibroue’s offerings to be milder on the flavour strength than Belgian styles from Belgium itself. That doesn’t make it bad, but they lean towards a more mild and complex flavour profile. They also tend to be more fruity than malty, and that is the case here. They write that rum flavours abound in the nose and palate, my experience has been with the fruity side of the beer it has a strong port or sherry side rather than rum, but you can get a rum taste. It’s just not as strong as other Belgian styles or malty Eisbocks. \n\nOverall it’s quite a formidable beer, just as good as anything out of Belgium, while carving out its own unique niche and noticeable flavour profile on its own. At the same time, mild enough to be enjoyed by any beer drinker, even though new to the style. Unibroue really does not tend to miss on any of their beers",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A real beauty to look at, from the dark brown body to the large, lasting tan head to the graceful lace. Layers of rich malts in the aroma where you can pick out dark fruit, pitted fruit, molasses, brown bread and probably a few other favorite descriptors. Just don't count on too many hop varieties. Taste leans the same way although the hops come into play a bit more. Spiciness is more noticeable, especially in the aftertaste. Sweetness is a factor while bitterness is minimal. Mouthfeel is full bodied and decently carbonated. Check the ABV before guzzling more than two.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Delicious strong beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Thick creamy head that can runaway if not poured carefully. Good amount of lacing that doesn't have any intentions of leaving. Strong dark grainy, slightly sweet smell. Strong sour notes, light bitterness and classic Belgian taste. Somewhat astringent on the backend. \n\nI love Unibroue's offerings and this one doesn't fail to impress. For sure in the top tier Belgians. You can tell it's strong however as the alcohol is present.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It was nice to pick up three Unibroue singles a few weeks ago. This was the one new-to-me brew of the bunch. And what a great brew it is. Unibroue seems to always make very easy drinking versions of styles that are often not the easiest.\n\nThis pours a gorgeous deep brown with tons of fine foamy head. The aroma is subdued (my beer is warming), but appetizing and a bit boozy. The taste is delicious malts and yeast. I don't think this sample is very old, but this style would age well. I should get a sixer and put some up.\n\nRecommended. I will be happy to have this again some time - it is a nice and easy version of the style while not being phony or wimpy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Dark brown color, not quite black. Tan tall head that dissipates into a centimeter of coating on top. Moderate lacing that sticks. \n\nS: Black cherries. Sweet malt. Undertones of alcohol. I might be crazy but it smells a little bit like coca-cola. \n\nT: sweet and thick are the dominant characteristics. More dark fruit, cherry and raisin. Bitter/sharp on the back end that can make it feel not as heavy as it really is. \n\nF: medium-full bodied. A nice level of carbonation. \n\nO: close in profile to Belgian darks. Has some interesting qualities of fruit and tartness but still doesn’t top actually Belgian’s to me. Still very good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nothing to say that hasn’t already been said. Impeccably well crafted example of the style. Hard to believe it’s not made by monks in a Belgian Abby. Oh Canada!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Dark brown beer with a huge beige head. Very fine and complex aroma with vinous notes, also notes of oak, spices, cocoa, red berries and dark fruits, hints of barnyard and tobacco. The flavour is sweet, vinous and fruity, quite smooth for 9% ABV beer. Moderate hops. Many of the elements of the aroma stay with you through the flavour and aftertaste. An excellent beer!",

Leaves some strings and partial walls of lacing.\nAroma of the earthy, metallic yeast, along with apple, date, and cherry, with a little dark malt.\nTaste is cherry and date fruit, and some dark malt; this combo is sweet. Mainly at the end is the yeast, which dries out the palate through the after taste.\nMouth feel is full. Some spiciness on the tongue. The higher ABV% does bring a boldness. Very good carbonation. Low bitterness.\nThe dryness at the end entices another sip but be careful with the 9%; it will warm you up in the hurry. Would be a good food pairing with a sharp or strong cheese, or with a stew or lasagna.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: Dark brown with a light khaki head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind a fine lacing around the edge of the glass (tulip).\nS: Dried fruit (cherries and dates) up front followed by Belgian yeast, malt, and some alcohol.\nT: Sweet and full. More dried fruit and maybe even a little browned apple. It has a port wine character up front. The finish is classic Belgian phenolic yeast. Spices, fruits, a bit of hot alcohol on the exhale and a clean, lingering finish.\nM: Medium bodied with a lot of tingly carbonation. \n\nA great beer to pair with a meal. It's not too sweet and not too dry. The carbonation clears you palate for the next bite or sip."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled\n\nChimay Blue is a god-tier beer. Red is one that is not quite as acclaimed, but if it matches the quality of Blue I will be very impressed. Also, despite my love for Belgian beers, I have not had very many Dubbels, though I thoroughly enjoyed the one’s I’ve had. Let’s see if this legend lives up to the hype\n\nPours a murky mahogany color with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that very slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nThe nose here is beautiful balanced with the dark fruit and subtle spice complementing the chewy malt. I’m picking up on aromas of gold raisin, fig, dark toffee, allspice, brown bread, clove, and a hint of caramel\n\nThis focuses on the malt way more heavily in flavor, but works in its advantage. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting raisin, sticky toffee, brown bread, light black cherry, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of sweet black cherry, clove, doughy malt, light vanilla, molasses, and caramel\n\nA medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and luxuriously creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a wonderful sweetness\n\nSuch a wonderfully crafted beer, absolutely perfect for a warm summer night. I’d get it far more frequently if it wasn’t $8 a bottle",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I like the red Chimay as it gives the taste of a Tripel with a lighter ABV of 7%. Complex beer with many of the fig/banana/ sweet candy flavours of others, without a lasting hangover. This bottle was a little light on the effervescent side, and the head was gone in a flash, with not much for carbonation through the ending dregs. \nI am preparing myself for our annual holiday, Canada Day, when I will only drink the colours of the flag, Red and White. \nNext up, Chimay White!",

Some haze. \nSmells like sweet grain and caramel. Tastes like dried fruit like dates, figs maybe some apricot with a bready sweetness.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 9/22/16\n\nWell, after having KBBS, the highest rated beer in the world and a heavily adjuncted Stout for review 1000, I figure a classic, no frills Stout is the logical next step. I’ve never had this one fresh, but I’m excited to try it regardless, especially for the Cellaruary thread. Let’s get into it\n\nPours a muddy dark brown with a finger of tan head that immediately fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing\n\nIt is pretty wild the complexity a Stout can have without barrel aging; everything speaks for itself without any distraction. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark toast, toffee, earthy bourbon, light roast coffee, and charred oak\n\nI know the age and abv definitely play a role in bumping up the complexity and robustness of this beer, but it's an impressive thing regardless. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, black cherry, caramel, charred malt, dark bready malt, bourbon, light raisin, and a touch of red wine. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, rich red wine, charred malt, toffee, black cherry, and a touch of acidic coffee\n\nA full body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a somewhat hot beer. Finishes off dry with a lightly tart fruitiness\n\nThis is solid stuff right here. I really can't believe I waited this long to try it.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer has always been good, quite good. A couple times great. What I've found is that it varies quite a bit with batch and age.

Very dark in appearance, as one would expect. Very strong roasty smell of boozy vanilla. Very intense flavor with some vanilla, hints of chocolate and overall sweetness.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Opaque black color, huge alcohol aroma and flavor, sweet flavor, but by no means cloying, long warm finish. The alcohol in this beer overwhelms the tastebuds to the point that the stout character is not detectable. But it's really good!",

Very bitter and sweet, the coffee is bitter and sweet, the hops are bitter, the malt is honey-like in flavor and feel and sweetness (i.e. pure sugar). If I can describe the taste in cave-man terms - &quot;chocolate sweet, malty, then bitter coffee alcohol burn&quot;.\n\nThis is a big, thick, chewy beer, and it hides the 18% astonishingly well, actually able to fold the &quot;woody&quot; alcohol flavor back into the rest of the attack on your taste buds: coffee, chocolate, honey, and all the sweet malt duking it out on the sweet/bitter battlewargrounds, making a mess all over your tastebuds",

No light coming through at all, even directly to light. A serious looking beer.\n\nS: A lot going on here, but much of it is kind of buried beneath a strong, hot boozy aroma. Bourbon and port mostly. Dark fruits like plum and raisin, medicinal cherry. A hint of vanilla, roasted malt. This is a complex aroma, but a bit heavy on the alcohol.\n\nT: Vanilla, roasted character. Dark fruit in the mid-palate. Finishes very heavy on the port alcohol character. Hard to unpack a lot of the flavors in here due to the heavy alcohol content. \n\nF: A bit oily and coating, but burns a bit going down and when held in the mouth. \n\nOverall: There is a lot of good in here, but it is buried under a ton of alcohol. On an experimental level, that's kind of the point, and I'd like to revisit this after a few more years to see how that continues to mellow out.

Found it to pour a little thin and found the mouthfeel to be a little thin as well, especially compared to some of today's thicker pastry stouts.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!\n\nPoured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.\n\nNose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.\n\nMore promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol &quot;heat&quot; is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.\n\nMedium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel. \n\nThis is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amber hues and sticky sweet. Booze and pine. Caramel malts. Noticeable lack of citrus on the nose and in the taste. Musty hops and dark fig fruit. Bubbly to the finish. Outrageous bitterness becomes more pronounced as it warms, rounding out the flavor profile and improving the taste. Overall quite nice. And at 12% ABV, it will do the trick.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nPours the color dark wildflower honey, a deep amber with sunny hues of orange.\n\nBouquet:\nSyrupy sweet hops, mango, citrus, and pleasing, earthy yeast after-notes.\n\nTaste:\nYe gods, hops! A spectacular symphony of hops: musty herbals, bright florals, and sharp citruses. All riding in on a lush wave of lavish treats, like butterscotch, caramel, and raspberries. Finishes with a clean, powerful heat.\n\nFeel:\nFull-bodied. Satiny molasses with a bubbly bite. The treacle-like qualities don't overstay their welcome, but the bright, effervescence lingers like a miniature fireworks display, as its tickling bubbles burst brilliantly in all corners of the mouth. The contrast is delightful.\n\nReviewer's Notes:\nBottle aged for 3 years at 42 degrees Fahrenheit, no exposure to sunlight. Bottling Date: 05/10/2016",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Boy this one’s good. Whew. Powerful and strong yet flavorful and clean. So-called “triple” IPA obtained fresh from Founders via growler. Purchased on 9/6/19. Start off only decent, pours a honeyed medium amber color with a little white head that quickly settled to a thin film. Also just a little scarce spotty lingering lacing. Even with a rocky pour, the fluffy white head had settled quickly. The aromas, however, were just incredible. Beautiful fruity hops of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, guava and lemon. Also some nice malt, floral and herbal hops, bread, caramel and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, very rich and flavorful with good balance. The strong hit of hoppy bitterness was well offset by the sweeter malt backbone that had a good presence. Mouthfeel was excellent, sticky, slightly luscious, smooth and coated the palate. Good amount of carbonation. This was definitely a sipper, the higher ABV was quite present even with the beer cold, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’m happy that Founders brought this one out of retirement to serve it on tap at their brewery.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Oooooh. Almost brown-orange. Easily the prettiest of the four IPAs I ordered as a flight at the Founders brewery. Persistent lacing and continuous bubbles. \n\nSmell: It smells wet, the way that yeasty Belgians can, but in a way that I know it's not actually going to taste like that. It's weird; honestly it smells a little &quot;off&quot;, but the taste is fine.\n\nTaste: Astringently hoppy (which I like), \n\nFeel: tingly, foamy. Thick and resinous but so effervescent, so quite a contradiction in mouthfeel\n\nOverall: compared against Founder's 12 Feet Under, I'd say I prefer 12 Feet Under. Maybe it's just because I have a fond place in my heart for things like Dogfish 120, or because barrell-aing anything is a great way to my heart. This is fine, and very hop forward, but doesn't have the depth of 12 Feet Under. Dogfish 120...12 Feet Under...120 Feet Under? I smell a collaboration in the future. Get on it, Founders!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle from the cellar. Bought in 2012. With a cabinet full of barley wines and belgian darks, this is a real standout. Low carb, low to no head. Deep copper/red color.

Too bad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smell of butterscotch. Taste starts as butterscotch and slowly fades to nearly the taste of the last sip of a sweet bourbon Manhattan. Aftertaste sticks around for minutes. Perfect mouthfeel. I really enjoy this beer, and you should too!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks promising. Smell promising. \nTastes average. Feels average. \nJust like a woman looking super hot from behind, only to realize that her face is... meh, not that hot.\nYou men all know the feeling!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Packaging-5/5- I'm going to talk about the packaging here for a second. This beer comes in a distinct thin bullet can with a powdery green tint and golden/rusty orange embroidered sign on the front. The design is great and it really does make this beer stand out from the others. It has a distinct classic and weathered look that's oddly memorable and visually represents what this beer is, or is trying to, perceive. Looks great.\n\nL-Pours a lively one finger headed ale with a finger and a half head and a golden amber-ish color. Subtle bubbles are there as well.\nS-Smells like a very well crafted standard imperial IPA. Malty front with some hints of butterscotch and molasses. Piney, and earthy hop resin is there. Also, in some way, I almost get a candy-like Sweet Tart aroma. Smells great.\nT-Not bad on the flavor. Malty sweet upfront with a bitter bite at the end. Subdued enough to invite other flavors as well. There is definitely some mandarine orange here, with a hint of grapefruit.\nF-A medium bodied, juicy mouthfeel with a dry and refreshing finish.\nO-Quite the experience. From the can to the finish I enjoyed this beer thoroughly. It's hard to come by an imperial IPA that is made so well and is so drinkable. Glad I got to try this!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Such a pretty, orange/rusty colour in the glass with a bright, white, persistent head.\n\nThis can is reasonably old so aroma is restrained. There's some caramel and pine and a little bit of orange peel.\n\nThe flavour though... Oh my, the flavour. This beer is proudly IPA, even with age on the can. There's piney, resinous notes, some diesel and dankness that has taken over from where I would have expected fruitbowl citrus in a younger beer, but it still tastes fantastic. It's no longer able to hide its alcohol but it's only adding to the pleasure of the newly evolved whole that this beer has become. \n\nCan't wait to taste it fresh!\n\nCheers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks fantastic for the style. Pours a beautiful, cloudy golden hue with a nice two finger white head which dissipates to leave a sticky white lace as it recedes. Smells fruity and hoppy. Slight citrus, pine, hops, and something l can't quite put my nose on, floral, but it's pleasant. I like it. Taste is slightly citrusy, floral, piny, hoppy. Great flavors that come togethet nicely, but a bit overcomplicated for my taste. Really love the unknown floral type flavor though. So faint, but it's there. Feel is great from start to finish. Medium carbonation turns slightly creamy towards the end. Overall, a fine brew that hides the 9.1% abv well. 10.99 for a sixer. Not terrible at all. Glad l grabbed em.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev slim can, best by Nov 14, 2021 (oops), into THAT! NE IPA snifter. \n\nJuicy medium orange with a finger of head, no lacing as it recedes.\n\nAroma of pine, citrus, juicy yeast, spruce, and slight onion. \n\nFor being a month out of date, this is still tasting fantastic. Wonderful alcohol citrus notes all over the place, with some more tropical notes following. White grapefruit, mandarin orange, lychee, pineapple, peach, and mango all dance around some oily pine and circus peanut. I'm very impressed. \n\nFeel is carbonated, juicy, slightly resinous but less than you'd think when considering the name, with well hidden alcohol. \n\nOverall, really surprised I'm jamming this one. I thought it'd be a drain pour but there's still some life left and I really like what's here. This is probably my favorite Sixpoint IPA now. Gonna pick up a 6 pack when I encounter it again. Incredible stuff, very impressive. This is the Sixpoint of old times. Damn cheap too.\n\n$1.66 @ Binny's",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev draught\nMedium light gold tinged orange look. Persistent, off-white head. Medium, sweet spiced, medium roast malt aroma, with a bit of a Mandarin orange peel wave. An off dry, medium caramelized malt body, which supports the tangelo peel and a touch of grapefruit peel, as the overriding flavor, which carries to a long finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355ml can.\nL: Opaque, burnt orange with an off-white, creamy head that leaves arcs of lacing.\nS: English toffee.\nT: Caramel, overripe citrus and resin. Not too sweet, not too dry.\nF: Medium/full body with an oily mouthfeel and some background alcohol heat.\nO: An approachable DIPA. Not a hop bomb, not overly boozy (the alcohol is well hidden). The malt really carries this beer. It’s sweet and luscious but not cloying. Could easily drink a few of these but would then fall over, so best not.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 10/14/2021- Hazy pale gold with a robust head that leaves a foamy lace as it recedes; Mouthfeel is a little flat, as if it expended all that sparkle to make itself look good. :) I do like the taste; My invalid sniffer finds it neutral-ish; Yes indeed, quite tasty; Well, for that flavor coming in such a good looking beer it really ranks this one up there. And the mouthfeel, its maybe not so bad now that I get used to it. Ooh. Do I have a new favorite? I calculated the Smell score from the average of the other scores. that's right, innit? If I had a sense of smell I bet I would like the way this one smells.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a slim, tall 12 oz. can into a Perfect Pint glass. Translucent orange color with thick creamy white foam head. Nose of piney hops. I guess resin refers to pine resin, and there’s a bit of that but it’s not a major component. Taste is typical of a good double IPA, lots of hop up front tempered by malt but not too sweet. Also, it’s not a hop bomb. What do we have here then? Perhaps a “well balanced DIPA.” Mouth is slightly viscous/creamy and crisply bubbly.\n\nOverall: I really like this. It’s similar to my favorite DIPA, Dogfish Head’s 90 Minute IPA, but less sweet and possibly more enjoyable. I’ll have to do a head to head comparison sometime. Highly recommended.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev after a long day at work, sitting on my porch sipping Sixpoint Resin, wonderful way to end the day. Citrus, tangy, hoppy, refreshing not much else to say, highly enjoyable",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Feels so light for 9%.\nReally sneaky. Very balanced.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Medium gold color, mostly clear with one finger off white head, nice lacing. Citrus and lightly sweet malt flavors dominate into the finish. Very clean taste, somewhat soft.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by Oct 1 -21 it says on the can bottom.\nGolden amber and opaque but not hazy in the light, deeper amber in the shade. A tall sticky white head forms and slumps quickly to a dense ring with drapes of lace.\nSmells of wildflowers and conifers supported by a doughy sweetness with hints of ginger and lemon zest.\nThe flavor is almost weak up front for such a big beer - no flood of tongue heavy sugar that warns of the heft. \nBalance is the word - malt and hop bitterness blend well and while I know the 9% is there, the malt depth is as solid as the hop character. Rich, medium bodied caramel is spiced with grassy, piney hop acids and a nutty toasted grain thing goin on making this a tasty swallow-er not a sipper. \nThe finish is on the dry side with a hint of fruit.\nI never like the marketing of beer with terms like &quot;dank&quot; and resin since there is nothing reminiscent of cannabis in this beer despite the remote family connection to the hop plant. \nBS keywords aside, this is almost as awesome as the first time I had it 10 years or so ago and high on my list of go-to brews when I only want 1.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On a first date, she picked up five cans or Resin IPA from her residence and we shared them over pizza. We had a wonderful time and I loved the beer. To me, I[m 69 now, so my smell and taste buds are a bit shot, but this was the smoothest and best beer I ever had! I have Michelob Ultra, but the IPA was far superior. I may have to travel 12 or 30 miles for a local seller or maybe ca;; the brewery and take a ride during the week and visit the brewery in NY. I give it 5 stars.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Dark yellow, slightly orange color, slight haze\n\nS: Slight pine but with a clean and crisp smell\n\nT: It is a double IPA so you will get lots of hops but they seem balanced and not overpowering. Leave a long bitter sour aftertaste that lets you know you just drank some hoppy beverage.\n\nF: Pretty smooth for a hoppy IPA, long finish.\n\nO: Lots of alcohol and smooth flavor. This one can creep up on you. Not my #1 overall a very good Double IPA",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a dark gold with a one finger head. Smell is pine, melon and herbal notes. Taste follows with some sweetness and malts. Not overly hoppy which I appreciate. Fairly smooth going down with medium fizz. Hides the booze well. A little dry in the back end. A winner.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml can, at the Granite City (JDW), Aberdeen Airport. 9.1% ABV, 103 IBU. Orange colour, moderate head, slightly off-white. Surprisingly moderate aroma of American piney and grapefruity hops. In the flavour, however, both the piney / resinous and grapefruity notes are very distinct - still the beer is reasonably well balanced, the malts are sufficient, with a certain fruity sweetness, and where I expected an unbalanced resinous hell, there is actually as much smoothness as you can expect from a 103 IBU beer. Might well buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Super hoppy IIPA with a ton of resiny piney aspects to it. Look is a light gold, was expecting something a little bit darker for the style. Smell is just dank hoppy goodness with a slight citrus twang to it. Taste is hops, citrus, lemon, slight malt. Excellent beer for a big hop craving.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Best by 6/14/21. \n\nL---Lightly hazy, rich Amber color. Fluffy white head had good retention and left really nice lacing. \n\nS---Sweet, hoppy, green. Resin &amp; pine as advertised. Some citrus (grapefruit, orange).\n\nT---I didn't get malts on the nose, but there's a malt backbone in the taste. Everything else from the nose follows through.\n\nF---Medium bodied and we'll carbonated.\n\nO---A really nice IIPA. Should've bought more than just the one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden yellow with a 1 inch white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.\n\nAroma of pine, grapefruit, lemon.\n\nTaste follows nose: Pine, grapefruit, lemon, tangerine. Resinous.\n\nMedium bodied, lively carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.\n\nNice resinous IPA."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It doesn't smell ancient.  It smells fruity and hoppy with malts in the background. Like a sweet smelling IPA.\n\nIt's bitter up front and a little spicy somehow.  Then the bready malts are really strong.  It is also fruity the entire time.\n\nIt's a medium mouthfeel with a normal amount of carbonation.  The finish tastes like a pastry, both like bread and honey.\n\nIt's pretty damn good, not as exotic as the description promises (not a hint of saffron).  It's an interesting beer. I give it a 4.7 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Smells of honey, white grape juice &amp; grains; subtle boozy aroma. Taste follows the nose, this really reminds me of white grape juice that is carbonated, it is good though. Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth finish. Very interesting brew, I was happy to try it, but I don't think I would purchase again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Opaque, deep amber appearance with a small head and very little lacing. Sweet, honeyish aroma with varying degrees of maltiness. Flavor reintroduces the sweetness, as well as soft fruit (grapes, kiwi) and spice (particularly in the aftertaste). Vinous, medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel; long lasting finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev All I taste is saffron.\nWho drinks this stuff on a regular basis?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle from a mix-6, split with my wife and poured into a snifter. Aroma and flavor are white grape, dry honey, and surprisingly little alcohol for the 9% abv. An interesting beer and much more drinkable than I expected. Fun to try but not something I'm likely to buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Figured it was time to give this beer a whirl. \nThis bottle is ancient indeed...6/28/19, so a little over a year old at this point. Poured into an Ommegang snifter. \n\nPours a surprisingly gold color (I expected burnt orange like a barleywine) with a fluffy creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a mossy ring with lace built up on the sides. \n\nAroma is pleasantly fruity and bright with elements of grape and citrus, slight pineapple, slight melon. Everything is brighter than expected. I guess I should shift my focus. \n\nFlavor is a bit wasted at this point with some oxidized hops in tow somewhere; trying to re-align, I spot some more vinous but still white grape-ish notes, some oak barrel, a little bit of muscat, some melon rind, white grapefruit, honey, chive, and a bit of cilantro or other fresh herb. \n\nFeel is crisp and starchy, but has a nice sticky yet oaky barrel barrel presence. Alcohol presence is rather high but to be expected, though feels more along the lines of a 12%'er. Drying finish with that microfiber sponge feel. \n\nOverall this beer isn't bad, and I should try to find it fresher to get a better picture of it. Dogfish Head continues to be the curator of off-centered shit and this is definitely one of those examples. I like it though, it's twisted and won't fit into any of your neat little polite food tray-sized niches. \n\nPrice paid : $3.69 / bottle\nWould buy again : Probably, to try it fresher.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 1/22/20\n\nAncient ales, huh? My first one of the series, I didn't even realize they were doing a batch this year\n\nPours a lightly cloudy orange/gold with just a white cap that fizzles away to a ring of bubbles very fast and leaves no lacing\n\nQuite the odd aroma here, I'm picking up a lot of different notes. There's an earthy, peppery spice carrying through, white grape, and raw honey all combine to make an odd but not bad scent\n\nOh yeah, that's a fuck ton of saffron in the taste, not really something you expect in a beer, even though this is brewed with it. The honey comes though strong in the beginning, sweet and unrefined, and only gets sweeter as the sip progresses. However, there are tart fruit notes to finish, mostly white grape, peach, and green apple. Oddly enough, the flavor reminds me of some strange nitro energy drink I had years ago that I think was supposed to be grape flavored and had some spice as well\n\nPretty light body and mild carbonation, this thing bounces back and forth between tart and sweet to keep things interesting. Finishes just off dry\n\nA perplexing beer for sure. One could argue that this is a great example of a beer with non traditional ingredients and pulls it off due to lack of expectations. Others however, might say that this is hardly beer and is not good. Regardless of how weird this is, I like it quite a bit. DFH always keeps it weird",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nPours a diaphanous shade of burnished gold blended with vibrant, daffodil yellow. Forms a dense, white froth, similar to the creamed bubbles that crown an authentic cappuccino. Leaves a geometrically perfect circle of sudsy white lacing that thins out the further it reaches, but endures unbroken all the way to the end.\n\nBouquet:\nBushels of honeysuckle flowers, trailed by a delicate mist of Moscato, puffed cereal grains, freshly sliced Honeycrisp apple, and a trace of orange rind that gently ushers the aroma away from being too sugary.\n\nFeel:\nA medium body that's granted manly heft by a foamy, nimbus texture I've never experienced before. Imagine if cotton candy were ghost and that'd put you near the mark of this ale's magical mouthfeel. A caress of sinful silk with a dry, Riesling finish.\n\nTaste:\nHoneycomb slathered in sweet, golden nectar. The honey aspect is earthy and intensely real. Not store-bought honey, not honey flavoring, more like: caveman who owns his own beehive, honey. This primal delight is followed by juicy white grapes, a liberal layer of powdery saffron, and a far-off melody of malts melded with tart fruit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice fine head about a finger thick, lots of small carbonation bubbles. Clear gold in color. Smells like white wine/ champagne. It's hard to pin down the flavor, pretty unique. Like a mild bitter ale with hint of white grapes but nothing stands out which is good in it's own way. Finishes pretty dry. Overall, it's decent. Worth trying but not particularly my kind of brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled on 6/28/2019, revisiting this classic after who knows how many years. \n\nLook: The beer is translucent with a slight haze. Straw - pale gold. Some visible carbonation. A bone white head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer, with some larger bubbles here and there. Some lacing at first that eventually goes away.\n\nSmell: The nose on this pops with sweet and bready grains, and bright, vinous white grape that has white wine qualities. Apple and apple skin. Honeysuckle. As the beer warms the ABV becomes slightly noticeable, but not in a distracting way. \n\nTaste: The taste is sweeter than the nose suggests, and the honey really comes out in the flavor. It’s bit heavier on the palate than the nose, as the white wine quality gets a bit lost with the sweetness. Quite bready and sweet with some yeast esters showing. The beer does dry out a bit. \n\nFeel: Medium level of carbonation that offers some nice lively body to the sweet flavor. Starts sweet and dries out. \n\nOverall: The nose on this beer is great. The flavor profile is a bit sweeter than the aroma suggests, and I’d love more of the grape profile in the flavor. That being said, this beer is very drinkable for 9%, and overall very enjoyable. Happy to have revisited.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a copper-orange with bits of grit and particles suspended within the liquid as if they were frozen in time. Head is a finger and a half of off-white foam with modest retention. Aroma is honey, caramel, orange, tart green grapes, grassy, herbal and floral hops with a bit of biscuity, toasty malts behind. Very odd, but bright, aroma. Flavor profile is dense, layering notes of safron with tart, juicy grapes, orange rind, and honey. Malts form a light bready, earthy base, but the overall consistency is 'sweet'. Mouth feel is lightly pulpy with that suspended grain playing a role within the texture. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, thick and rindy with hearty notes of grapes and honey making for a sweet and off-center brew. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle from Brewers Haven. Clear, medium golden body with a small cap of foamy head. Grainy aroma, malty, reminiscent of some of the emmer or spelt beets in Germany. Taste starts out malty before turning over to some savory, herbal flavors, woody, juniper. I guess the ancient Sumerians had it pretty good...",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 06/28/19. A light orange color with an odd look due to the tiny specks of suspension. The light carbonation is a nice addition though. No head. The aroma is nice. It does smell sweet like wine. Taste follows the nose and I get some sweetness that would make me think of soda pop almost. The flavors on the tongue are like an orange drink. It tastes good but it doesn't seem beer like at all. The mouthfeel is very nice. I think you pour this into a cup and tell someone it's soda pop and they wouldn't know the difference. That 9% ABV would be a BIG surprise though. Overall an interesting experience that a beer nerd would appreciate from the truly great craft brewer Dogfish Head, Milton, Delaware.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reviewing a bottle that is at least 2 years old.\n\nPours a clear orange/yellow.\n\nSmells and tastes of honey. No malt no hops. Sweet and clean. Almost wine. \n\nThe first bottles in this six pack had a bit of a funky taste as I recall. Time has got rid of this.\n\nThis is a unique and potent brew!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Miller Lite beer is terrible. I hate lite beer, I hate miller and mix the two? You get a beer that makes you pee, too much foam, and not any flavor. This beer is for generation X and people who were old enough to get an Atari. People who drink this do no deviate from it because they saw the advertisement with the Christmas lights and decided that a lite beer was for them.

That's honestly probably the point, but it makes reviewing it kind of pointless.\n\nThis is very light bodied, almost water-like, with a vague off putting sweetness on the back end that's faint when very cold, but comes out stronger as the beer warms up a bit.\n\nThis isn't the absolute worst of this sort of beer, but it's still not really recommended at all.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16 oz. can poured into 20 oz. plastic cup.\nLook: No head, very light golden color, excellent carbonation, no lacing\nAroma: True to style, it had a slight maltiness, nothing to set it apart from others\nTaste: A touch bitter, no complexity, no finish, watered down\nFeel: Excellent Carbonation. flavor stays in mouth after swallowing\nOverall: Maybe it is the style, but it was not impressive. Like beer-flavored soda, nothing really stands out except the tongue-tingling.\nPairs with light cheeses light mozzarella and fried foods."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of my favorite beers ever, the dark, almost caramel flavor of the apricot is a much better compliment to the IPA style that you might think. A perfectly balanced beer and a great pickup if you can find it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The appearance was always a nice amber to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace to a semi-filmy lacing. The aroma, woah, absolutely freakin’ awesomely apricot to peachy goodness filling a super nice semi-bitter piney hoppiness running about the nose. The taste was mostly bitter but lead to a nice semi-sweet citrus-ness concerning itself to try to run itself about a nice aftertaste and ended up leading to a fairly same finish. On the palate, this one shows a nice sessionable quality running about it and still lends a hand to a nice carbonation running about its body and shows that there is nothing overbearing of the sorts on any end. Overall, good fruit beer that shows a decent bitter hoppiness trying to make it come across as an AIPA.",

A turbid swirl of hazy golden orange pushes a most bountiful dense, white, fluffy head to the rim. The retention is solid, and the lacing is layered and clumpy.\nNose is bursting with citrus and slightly acidic tropical notes. Orange, grapefruit, and tangerine lead the way. Overripe mango, pineapple, and some pepper-like notes.\nTaste goes in a little different direction. Definitely orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, and mango. Puling some melon, pineapple, and peppery grass notes too. But it's going in a harsher direction than initially hinted at. More bold than balanced. There is still a lot going on that I like, but she's a bit more than assertive.\nMouthfeel is fluffy, active, with a bitter finish.\nOverall, a very tasty, boldly hopped NEIPA. Maybe this can/batch was a bit stronger than usual. I'd love to give this another shot in the future."

I haven't seen many people describe it as a farmhouse ale, but that's how I would best describe it. The ABV seems a little stronger than 7%, but I'm not on my ass after a few. Not your &quot;after yard work&quot; beer; it's not what I would call &quot;refreshing&quot; -- more after you have showered and are getting ready for dinner. All things said, I would probably opt for Sofie, but Matilda is right after. My only disappointment -- they changed the label. The label below was classic!"

Lots of tiny, brilliantly white bubbles in the head. An attractive beer. \n\nS: Beautiful banana aroma backed up by clove, with wheat coming through towards the finish. It's almost like some sort of baked good - not quite as dark and richly spiced as banana bread though. Maybe akin to banana cream pie? Regardless, it smells amazing. The wheat starts to come through more strongly as the beer warms. \n\nT: Similar to the nose, although the individual flavors aren't quite as distinct as the aromas. The banana melds with a soft wheat character before finishing with a bit of lingering clove. There is a faint pear-like quality as well - I notice it most on the finish, alongside the clove. \n\nM: Medium body which is swept away effectively by the relatively high carbonation. Very pleasant to drink. \n\nO: A great weissbier - not the best, but certainly well worth drinking. While the quality of the beer doesn't threaten Weihenstephaner, I feel as though I could drink more of these in one sitting (and the comparatively lower price point, at least near me, makes that more feasible as well).",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The beer is a hazy, translucent, bubbly yellow color, kind of straw but looks more burnt orange when held up to a light. Some yeast sediment is in it. Ample carbonation leaves a huge soapy white head that lingers.\n\nThe aroma is slightly sour and mildewy, some orange and lemon juice, big white wine/white grape must come to think of it, hay, toasty biscuit, slight sweetness, and white pepper.\n\nThe taste follows the nose pretty closely. The main flavors upfront are of dry white wine complimented by a nice tart citrus, (orange and lemon peel) and subtle barnyard funk, with hay, toasted cracker, and a white pepper floating in the background. The wheat and effervescent carbonation give this a fluffy and extremely pleasant mouthfeel. It closes out on a perfect balance of the sweet-dry spectrum. A hint of sweetness to tantalize the taste buds but dry enough to beg the next sip. This brew is wonderfully made. Holy mackerel. I see why many people consider this to be the quintessential Belgian tripel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Westmalle Tripel.... it's been a minute since I've had a tripel, and I quite enjoy them, first time with this one.\nPoured into a stemless total wine glass. Hazy gold body, huge soapy white head off a gentle pour. Loose, large bubbles, bone white, slowly fall back to a 1/4&quot; thin head that persists through the life of the beer. Large chunks of sediment despite an attempt to decant.\nNose? Banana, bubble gum, peppercorns, candi sugars, candied lemon peel. A lot going on, complex, no diacetyl or dms, phenols out the wazoo. No hops to speak of. Yeast driven nose, everything else is buried. As it warms there is a slight white wine smell coming through.\nTaste, Bananas, bubble gum, alcohol, rock candy. Slight lemon on the aftertaste if I look hard. No hops, no grain, dry. As the beer warms there is a vineous note.\nMouthfeel- thin bodied and dry. Phenols give a suggestion of sweetness as does the alcohol. Effervescent. Each sip bursts into small bubbles as it hits the palate.\nOverall. It's a well made beer, the yeast phenols push it into hefe territory for me. I much prefer Karmaleit when it comes to the style. Not sure why I got so much banana from this bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy bright orange color. Mostly opaque with a moderate amount of suspended sediment. Thick two finger white head forms on the beer, settles in, then dissipates leaving just a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. The aroma on this is lovely - it has notes of malts, white grape, apple, pear, some light banana, and some floral hop notes. Its subtle, refined, yet complex. \n\nThe taste follows the nose with notes of rich malts, belgian yeast that leans into the fruity side of things with notes of apple, pear, white grape and just a hint of banana. Along with the fruity notes come some spiced notes - clove, allspice and peppercorn. Moderately spicy, but not overly so. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish with a light floral character. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, and somewhat warming. Very carbonated with a bright, lively mouthfeel. \n\nOverall this is an outstanding tripel and one I will absolutely revisit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev An absolutely gorgeous glass of beer that lasts to the last sip. Cloudy pale orange white sudsy head, but no lacing. This was flavorful and aromatic, banana, clove, caramel and a hint of pear. Smooth, creamy texture, long lasting carbonation. This is just a really great beer, I just didn't like.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy, golden amber coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smells of caramel malt, floral hops, with hints of citrus, some fruity esters and hints of toffee. Taste is a great balance of caramel malt, fruity and slightly spicy esters, with notes of banana, apricot and clove, as well as lighter floral, bitter hops with hints of orange rind and toffee also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with some banana, orange rind and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.\n\nThis is actually the first time I've had this Tripel and while it is very good indeed, it doesn't quite reach Tripel Karmeliet or Chimay Tripel to me. The banana notes are quite at the forefront here, which I'm not a huge fan of, while the spice is noticeable, but a little subdued. Nevertheless there's a great balance of malts, hops and esters to this, with quite a rich and full body and mouthfeel as well. I was actually surprised by how much hops, relatively speaking, are left in this at just over one year old and would love to try it fresh sometime, which just might edge it a little closer to my aforementioned favorites. Also, considering that this has the highest ABV out of any Tripel I've tried so far, it really doesn't feel overly boozy at all.",

Will have to come back to this (many times!) to develop my palate a bit more. Suffice it to say, it’s very enticing. Delicious aromas of yeasty breads, wheat, and spices waft around. Banana’s and specifically green apples make up a strong fruity backbone — less citrus and juicy, more of that smoother textured fruits, the aforementioned creamy bananas, silty earthy apples. Again, that tasty savoury aroma appears almost heavy in my nose. Maybe I know what people mean when they say ‘doughy yeast’ now\n\nTaste does follow the nose, and is remarkably complex in many ways. Spicy fruits up front here for me, apples cloves and nutmeg, a little sweet with maybe only the slightest hint of hop bitterness. Savoury in the middle with tasty grains and malty notes, candi sugar, and banana. There is a very long finish that rests on a gentle bitter-sweetness, remaining with a doughy taste on your tongue. \n\nMedium bodied, this is well carbonated but not carbonated too strong as to overpower the flavours. Coalesces into a creamy sip on the way down, finishes dry and bittersweet leaning on the sweet side. \n\nI love overpowering malty Tripels, which is not what you get with Westmalle. Instead, you get one that is a little gentler, but melds an enormous amount of wonderful aromas and flavours into a perfectly blended and smooth beer. No note stands out too much, each has its place and they wax and wane in and out together to create a remarkable experience. Absolutely wonderful beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is what great Belgian beer should look, smell and taste like .... Fluffy white head, pretty color, beautiful bouquet and lovely feel ... Big thumbs up!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A marvelous beer. Pours with a complete white head. It has a very malty scent. The flavor is very strong and this one sneaks up on you. Loved it. Not perfect, but I don’t know what would be better.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev World class! Great tripel. Citrus, resin, pine, light malt, little bit of an alcohol sting. Smooth going down. Two thumbs up!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Brouwerij Westmalle &quot;Tripel&quot;\n25.4 fl. oz. brown glass bottle &quot;BEST BEFORE END: 2022/11/30&quot;. Sampled on 2022/01/23.\n$11.99 @ Total Wine &amp; More, Cherry Hill, NJ\n\nNotes via stream of consciousness: Another beer that's slipped by without me reviewing it. I used to drink a fair amount of this back in the days when craft breweries were few and far between, and I almost have to laugh because back then the big bottles of Belgians were the expensive beers! These days it's the American craft breweries that are taking all the dollars per ounce. It's poured a hazy golden body with a slight bit of an orange sheen beneath a massive head of rocky bright white foam. The head retention is amazing. It started at about an inch and a half tall, maybe more, and it's still an inch tall ten minutes later. Obviously the bubbles rising from below help, and I realize now that I've got it in a large Duvel tulip that's etched on the bottom to create nucleation points for the CO2. The aroma is fruity with apple and banana, a little spicy/woody/earthy (coriander, peppercorn, damp forest), and just lightly bready/biscuity and malty. It's not the boldest aroma in comparison to a lot of newer beers out there these days but you certainly won't miss it. Besides, why does a beer have to have a massive aroma anyway? On to the taste. I think, not surprisingly, that it tastes as it smells. It's fruity, a little sweetish (sugar, honey), cracker-like, peppery, subtly floral, and crisp and dry. There's an undertone of alcohol that enhances the peppery spiciness and bitterness, all of which work together to offset the lightly sugary sweetness and fruitiness. For being a beer that's made up of only golden malts it lingers for some time. In the mouth it's crisp due to the very fine-bubbled, natural, and effervescent carbonation. It warms to become slightly airy though, and creamier. I can't really tell where the body is because of the carbonation. On one sip it seems medium-light but on the next it flips to medium-full. I'll just go with medium for now. It's been a while since I've had this; the last time I think was in Roma, Italy in 2015 but it's mostly as I remember it - this one seems to have a little less banana, but that could just be my changing tastebuds. In any case, this is a classic of the style and basically fault-less. It might even have been the first golden tripel but don't quote me on that. \nReview #7,725",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2 oz bottle, dated March 23 2021.\n\nIt's a gorgeous beer, lots of foam and bubbles, with a mouthfeel to match. The smell and taste are bananas and cloves, and of course the classic yeast. It's not sweet. \n\nI've had Westmalle Tripel before, but never rated it. My highlight memory was in Brussels several years ago. It was my first visit to Belgium, and day after day was filled with wonderful Belgian beers, all new to me then. We were in the main fine arts museum in Brussels, overdosing on paintings, and stopped at the cafeteria. I grabbed a bottle of beer from the cafeteria cold table, put it on my tray. I knew nothing about what I had just grabbed. But the beer stopped me cold in my tracks. It was wonderful, and nothing like an American cafeteria line beer. That brought home to me how different the beer scene in Belgium was. We weren't in a beer geek bar, we were in a run of the mill cafeteria. And the Westmalle Tripel was like nothng I'd ever had. Great stuff.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2oz bottle, 6mo old\n\nCloudy, tons of suspended sediment, REEKS like banana Laffy Taffys. Peppery banana, little clove, pretty sweet but not overly so, nutmeg, dark fruits, little bit of green apple, just a touch of lemony hops. As it warms, the alcohol heat comes out and the flavor gets more complex\n\nSimply one of the best beers readily available to me",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 11/30/20\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Tripels but I respect them for what they are. And I know this is considered a classic beer by many, so I'm very happy to finally try it. I never used to see it around anywhere beer shopping but it just popped up one day last month and I figured why not. Let's pop it open\n\nPours a cloudy dark gold with 2 fingers of creamy thick white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nThere's a bit of an earthy funk in the nose in this one that I'm digging, it keeps it balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet pear, apple skin, wet hay, lemon zest, doughy malt, and overripe banana\n\nThe taste here is quite complex, but it all melds together very well to create a nearly crushable beer. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, lemon zest, white wine, candi sugar, white pepper, and light floral hops. The swallow brings notes of sweet doughy malt, white pepper, honey, clove, floral hops, and overripe banana\n\nA medium body pairs with moderate fine carbonation, resulting in a downright drinkable beer for the abv. Finishes mostly dry with just the slightest hint of warming alcohol to let you know that it isn't messing around\n\nSeriously wild how easy this one goes down. A very good beer that is getting me excited to seek out more quality Tripels",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance is an extremely clear golden color with loads of foamy head with very good retention and lacing. Aroma is heavy on the yeast, with cloves and bananas both present. Taste has yeast and fruity esters...banana, clove &amp; grains that all work very well together. Alcohol is very well hidden. Lively, crisp and clean. An excellent Belgian Ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 33cl bottle. Bottled 2020-10-26, best by two years after that. Poured into a New Belgium tulip I had around.\n\nL: Lots of head (probably would have been less in the right glassware), good retention. Dark golden, a little hazy.\nS: Banana, yeast.\nT: Lots of fruitiness, a little spice, maybe even a little hop bitterness in the end. All these flavors linger and mix for a long time post-sip.\nF: Light and fizzy. Nothing about this beer tells you it's 9.5%...\nO: De Garre might just top it in style, but for me it's the best tripel that's widely available in the US.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful beer. Smells like a nice cinnamon banana, yeasty and fruity. Flavor is very well developed and hits many points, bready, hoppy, fruity, and a slight spice. I’m probably not the best at explaining this beer, but it’s delicious. Great carbonation and fluffy head must be mentioned!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks golden and hazy. Smells of yeast and banana. Taste of yeast and a bit of bitterness. Overall its alight.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Served in a Delirium Snifter \nCracked the top open and a waft of semi spicy orange/doughy scent wafted across the kitchen Steady even pour unleashed a mountain of head, all stick to walls type of mystery. This is the glue that holds us together lads!Took an extra 3 minutes to drain the bottle into the snifter. \nFirst taste was fruity and rich with raisin and banana undertones to a slightly bitter first draw. \nI start to notice a bit of cloudiness, so take another draft, and notice a slight change in temperature affects the flavour in subtle ways, to enhance even more tastiness. Great! 3 beers in 1! \nThe fluid level goes down and the bitter after taste rears it's head, but not enough to stop another quaff. \nABV at 9.5 arrives quickly, Bing Bang Bombed. \nI would be amongst the 1st in line to rate another bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Note: 1 Pint, 9.4 fl. oz. bottle. Bottled 11/16/2020. Best Before: 11/16/2022\nAppearance: Hazy gold, big frothy white head with great retention.\nAroma: Yeasty, banana, bubble gum.\nFlavor &amp; Aftertaste: Yeasty, ester flavors. Surprising bitterness. Quite dry. Slightly warming, alcohol hidden but noticeable.\nMouth-feel: Light, highly carbonated.\n\nOverall: Doesn't look like it would be a big beer, but it is. Looks light, but drinks more medium to full bodied. Very carbonated. Very elegant complex beer. Banana like esters, a hint of bubble gum. A little surprised by the lingering bitterness, but it's not offensive or harsh at all. Very high quality.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fantastic ale. Aroma of banana bread, cloves and yeast. Taste is velvety smooth and complex. The 9.5% alcohol is just right. This is a benchmark ale by which others are compared and few surpass."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A near opaque matte, dull rust/copper body with an aggressive but not violent red clay tinged head. Lacing is pretty good. Nose is a mix of toast, spice, and yeasty notes including a little bubble gum. The toasted grain lays a nice foundation for a mix of orchard fruit jam and fall spices. The opening feel is nice, punching in around medium with a softness, but the carbonation ends up a little less restrained than the head it helps produce. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with quite complimentary flavors.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH Goblet Glass\n\nThe beer pours a murky copper color with about three fingers worth of foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving some light lacing behind\n\nThe aroma is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread, raisins, plums, banana, and caramel. There is also a spicy aroma that compliments the sweetness\n\nLike the nose, the flavor is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread and dark fruits. Lightly spicy with some caramel and toffee that rounds it out. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated with a smooth finish\n\nOverall, Maudite is a nice beer with a lot going for it. Very nice",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a bottle from 2011, so please take that into account with this review. \n\nIt pours a muddy reddish-brown that seems to be in line with fresh, but not much of a head. Clears decently as it warms up.\n\nThe smell is fruity, both the raison fig contingent and some nice apple. Slightly spicy, peppery, heavy on the bread. Very weak banana when fully warmed.\n\nThe taste opens sweet and spicy, black pepper and coriander. The pepper sensation lingers thru and continues well after the swallow. The sweetness morphs into the fig/raisin fruit thing rather nicely. I thought the malty bready notes would be stronger, but they show up almost as a third layer of flavor. There's a toffee flavor that I think can be chalked up to age. It's kind of a subdued malt bomb where the malt is strong, but the supporting cast gets equal billing.\n\nMildly carbonated, peppery tingle lingers, sweet but not sticky, and towards the dry side despite the sweet part.\n\nOverall, this tastes pretty fine. I'd buy it again based on how it tastes now. I'm feeling it has lost some edge but has mellowed into something pleasant.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cloudy, deep ochre colour in a tall goblet. Generous 4-5 inch head slowly condenses into a thick two inch head supported by the carbonation over the next 15 minutes.\n\nSmells are lovely and complex. Overall spicy smells up front followed by gentle malts. Lots of bread, spices, peppery stuff here. \n\nWhat a lovely taste. There are three parts on most of my sips. The up front — strong and peppery, coriander and Black pepper. Followed by the middle, which comes quickly after the spicy sip — malts and hop character swirl around, sweet bread and yeast followed by some grassy, clove-like bitterness. It ultimately finishes with the strong malt, yeast backbone, and the coriander and orange citrus notes can absolutely be noticed here. \n\nAs the beer warmed and I continued to sip I noticed a tiny bit of candied plum flavours in the finish, which again, was strongly malt forward and relatively sweet. \n\nBeer is medium-ish bodied, smooth, nice carbonation, the alcohol doesn’t present a strong bite here anywhere. Finishes sweet but mostly dry. \n\nThis is overall quite a gorgeous beer. The one time I’m happy to be in Canada when it comes to beer is being so close to Unibroue. We can’t import international beers, and our offerings are tightly controlled by the government liquor boards, but we always always always can get the first pickings of Unibroue’s beers. Their winter collection is awesome. Maudite is an excellent beer and it has been 10 years ago when I first tried it, and is excellent to this very day.",

No real hop presence and the 8% booze is hidden too. the nose is sort of mild overall, but is appealing and works for the style.\nThe first sip reveals a medium body with slightly syrupy texture and fine tingly carbonation. Feels like its a little bit of a bigger beer. \nFlavor is malty up front with caramel and some brown sugar and then rolls to a bit of green apple hit and quickly gives over to spices of clove and cinnamon. I get a bit of black pepper bite on the finish and mild warming booze on the swallow.\nThis is a fun beer to revisit after quite a hiatus. Im going to circle back to many of the Unibroue line again. This is worth a sampling for a Dubbel with some spiciness.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A 2016 version, poured out of a 32oz crowler that I picked up @ SLL in Sept. 21. I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgaard. ABV is 9.8%. 50 IBU. Cloudy brown colour, low beige head of poor retention. Sweetish malty aroma, notes of caramel and oak, hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. Not as sweet flavour as I feared, malty and oaky, caramel and dried figs, well balanced with the hops, a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Would buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent.",

It's nice and refreshing, and would honestly pair well with any sort of summer fare. It's an incredibly drinkable wheat ale, with plenty of inoffensive qualities. It's just that nothing really stands out, except for the beautiful three-finger head that lingers to the completion of the brew.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Picked this one up at the local liquor store because I remember going to Chicago Cubs games as a kid and seeing 312 being advertised and sold all over the place. I thought why not give this one a try on this beautiful Memorial Day here in Michigan. I will say the bottle on this one is beautiful. I am a guy who drinks straight out of the bottle and I will say this is one nice-looking bottle compared to your other generic wheat beers. This beer has a very wheaty smell and to me smells just like a &quot;beefed-up&quot; version of a typical American lager such as Miller or Coors. That smell goes right into the taste because this is a very wheaty/grainy tasting beer. While it is filling, this is a smooth beer that would go great with a day on the lake. A nice 6 pack of this stuff will serve you will an incredible day on a summer day.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.4%. Pale golden colour, hazy when the yeast is poured in, moderate white head.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1713\nAbrasive Ale\nSurly Brewing\nImperial IPA\nDate: 17 Dec 2021\nAnother beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent. \nRipe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal. \nInteresting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank. \nThe mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers. \nThis is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a light chill haze pale yellow, nice white head laces very well.\n\nAroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.\n\nTaste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.\n\nMouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.\n\nOverall a solid big IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This was a wonderful throwback IIPA, with a heavy dollop of bitterness along with the grapefruit, melon, and tangerine hop flavors. Body is phenomenally crisp and drinkable given the high ABV. Wholly worthy of its lofty reputation, and well worth a repeat visit - frequently, if at all possible.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinda a wishy washiy color but that was the only close to negative part of a review I could come up with. And I am never looking for negative stuff anyway. Great beer from a fine brewery. I got a 4 pk from my Total Wine here in the Daytona area and am glad they had it for sure. Limited somewhat but maybe I can sneak over there agian tomorrow and pick up another 4 pack. Well worth it.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace. \n\nNose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward.\n\nTaste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor. \n\nFeel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch. \n\nThis is a such a great beer. Quenching and easy drinking. You could fool yourself into seasoning it until you fall on your face. So tasty and satisfying, I can go for another, and another, and another,",

From a 16oz can, bought somewhere recently for a bit o' coin... \n\nIt pours a rich, bright, medium golden color. Has a slight smidge of haze, but it's mostly clear. Carbo is steady, though the head is a thin layer of fine white foam, with light lacing. Has a nice aroma, with tangerine, pineapple and pithy grapefruit all present and accounted for. Body is medium to medium-plus, and it passes smoothly over the tongue.\n\nTaste is more on the sweeter side vs. bitter.... Has peach, tangerine, pineapple, a hint of honey, a smidges of guava and passion-fruit. Has some subtle bitterness in the finish, though it is predominantly semisweet. Solid and tasty!

Canned on 11/18/20 and enjoyed in a snifter on 2/21/21.\nA: Pours an orange gold color with a half inch of white foam that dissipates fairly quickly. Minimal haze and semi-transparent\nS: Smells bitter with pine, resin and grapefruit as well as some orange rind, citrus, and apricot. Malts smell of caramel and biscuit and there is a bit of the dank cannabis smell. \nT: Wow! Hoppy bitterness on the front end, but has body and malt character to balance out the hops. Taste is similar to the nose with pine, resin, grapefruit, orange, and apricot but the citrus is more pronounced. The dank cannabis taste gets more pronounced as the beer warms and begins to dominate the after-taste and over come the floral after-taste. The biscuity malt also become more pronounced as the beer warms\nF: Smooth, abv is well hidden with right balance of carbonation. Leaves your mouth a bit dry but makes you want to reach for the glass again. Very balanced and leaves your mouth feeling refreshed. \nO: Another great Surly beer! Extremely well balanced and has all the qualities you want in an IPA. Definitely would buy again"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can with a big smudged date on the bottom\n\nLooks like a movie beer, very slight cloudiness with a nice cap of foam that sticks around. At least it isn't riding the hazy train, I'm going off the rails with these hazy grain (IPAs). Smells like earth, pine and caramel malts. Drinks a little slick and feels higher than the 8.2% listed, but a well-balanced IPA nonetheless; read: malt forward to most. Grapefruit rind, fresh grass, fresh grass that costs $20 a gram (also known as WEED, DOOD), and also a pine tart finish\n\nIt's good but nothing worth seeking out. As far as hops, the bill here could pass as a pale ale or even a lager... I imagine they are cutting costs and hoping no one notices. Maybe some will like a pale ale that happens to be 8.2% - I think it's kinda lame",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful, clear and golden body; nice slow rising carbonation; thick and billowy white head with excellent retention. Big aroma of mild caramel interspersed with spicy, pungent hoppiness; a touch of pine resin. Sweet and peppery flavor; caramel again; anise. Heavy body; chewy residual sugars; mild coarseness; semi-dry overall.\n\nThis is sample was a bit dated (bottle best by date: 05/06/21), yet it still has a fine balanced and depth going for it. It may be a bit sweet in the taste and mouthfeel, but how much the age of the beer may play a factor in this, I don't know. Still, I like it and would love to try it again.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a golden color, but clear, not hazy. Very strong pine resin on the nose with malt in the back. Taste is powerful hops and pine, a bit of sour malt.

Make it your last of the night because it's going to be hard to get a neutral palate back afterward.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 0.5 L bottle\nGlass: .5L Schneider Aventinus Weizenbock Vase\nServing Temp: ~45 degrees F\n\n\nLook: Medium brown that is opaque from the yeast. I can't see my fingers at all through the glass, not even at the narrow point. 1.5&quot; beige head dissipates to a thing coating and then disappears. This is abnormal for Aventinus; I find it to be typically a foam bomb, especially if it gets to 50 degrees F when pouring. Next time I have one, I'll update my look rating.\n\nSmell: Absolutely wonderful. Spiced plums and pears. Rum-soaked dried fruits such as raisins and currants. Rich brown sugar. Overripe bananas. Bread dough.\n\nTaste: As good as it smells, if not better. Cloves bite at the front, which keeps the sweetness dampened and balanced. Rich toffee and toasted caramel with plums, those rum-soaked dried fruits and the overripe banana. Whole wheat bread. Some pepper and maybe a dash of cinnamon. Finishes somewhat dry with lingering sweetness and cloves.\n\nFeel: Rich and creamy with a body that is on the heavier side of medium.\n\nOverall: What a joy to drink. A phenomenal beer. This earns it's World Class reputation. Although one can smell and taste rum-soaked fruit, the alcohol is quite well hidden. Very easy to drink. Dangerously so. .5L at 8.2% is about a 12% 12-oz. Goes down smooth as silk but will then hit you like a sledgehammer if you aren't careful. Great stuff. This is one of my favorite beers, and has been for well over a decade, if not 2. Absolutely worth trying.\n\nAnd this is for a 2.5 year old bottle that made the trip across The Pond, assuming the date on the bottle is the bottling date. If the date the Best By date, this is even older. It is better fresh vom Fass.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a tulip, a large three finger head manifests. Tiny bubbles at the bottom, thick ones at the top, it slowly coalesces into a permanent, two finger thick dense, rocky, creamy foamy head that lasts the entire time. A slightly hazy, deep red-brown colour, this looks absolutely phenomenal in the glass. An absolute triumph. It collapses into one of the densest foam heads I’ve ever seen on any beer — not sure what some of the other reviews below are about, but maybe their cans weren’t as fresh as mine.\n\nVery strong aromas of wheat and malt make up the base of the smell, slightly toasty. A little bit of boozy rum, and dried fruits like crispy sugared banana rings or raisins. Some spices and cloves of course! \n\nTaste follows the nose but there are some new flavours here, such as banana bread, some nutty flavours like almond, and maybe even a little bit of orange? Spicy cloves, toasty wheats, chewy malts, the works! Fig, raisin, rum flavours as well. Complex, and even a bit subtle at times. Except for those wheaty, malty, banana spice flavours, those are always up front.\n\nSmooth delicious mouthfeel, good carbonation that prickles your tongue without being too excessive as to wash away the flavours. Medium bodied I’d say, and it coalesces into a creamy gulp at the end of each sip. A nice long finish that is mildly sweet and keeps the general malts and candied fruits and banana on the tongue.\n\nMy oh my, what can you really say about this except for how good it is? I had to eisbock first and wanted to see how it compared. The Eisbock definitely concentrates some of the flavour, especially the malt and the darker flavours such as raisin and figs. So what is the difference? Other than the lower abv% here, the weizenbock keeps more of its dried and candied fruit flavours, and the orange/citrus fruit peel flavours as well. This one definitely has more banana in there as well. Both are champions of their respective styles, and in my opinion, the absolute top tier benchmark.\n\nThe Aventinus line is bold, beautiful, complex, and easy drinking. Absolutely phenomenal stuff. I’m overjoyed I grabbed the last 6 Eisbocks in all of Canada from the LCBO and always keep my fridge stocked with a couple of the regular Aventinus as well. 100% an absolute must try if you like German beers, or honestly, if you like beer in general.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'll preface by saying I went back to my job because I wanted the Eisbock but it turns out we just have this so I didn't exactly get what I wanted but anyways, I don't find this near the banana bomb some reviews say, I wish It was there more, to me this tastes very similar to the Belgian beer Kwak. Heavy on wheat and clove where as the spice and banana is super background. This is really good but idk how much I'd seek this in the future I really wanna try the eisbock",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's pretty funny to me how I've only had 1 Weizenbock before and now I'm jumping to the top rated one of the style.

Let's see what this one's all about\n\nPours a murky reddish brown with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nThe nose on here is just exceptional, much like a stronger and aggressive Dunkelweizen. I'm picking up on aromas of overripe banana, sweet raisin, rich toffee, brown bread, earthy wheat, clove, and doughy malt\n\nIt's equally rich in taste, with some more bite up front to keep things from getting overly sweet, which it borders on in the finish. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting banana, chewy toffee, orange rind, herbal hops, lightly spicy wheat, and light plum. The swallow brings notes of overripe banana, brown bread, lemon rind, white pepper, clove, and raisin\n\nA medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes semi dry with a lingering sweetness\n\nI really enjoyed this beer. It's super easy drinking for the abv and just straight up delicious",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Dark ruby brown in color with a frothy light tan head. Aroma of wheat and yeast. The taste is yeasty wheat, banana, clove, malt, and a hint of caramel sweetness.

The foam is smooth and practically effervescent sliding on the side of my glass.\n\nS: Wheat barley and hops. The cooler this came from doesn't have UV protection in the glass, and it's been shelved for 2-4 weeks, so it's a bit skunkier than intended. The ones in the back of the column and of course the back stock will fare better.\n\nT: Fresh hops. Roasted wheat and barley. Organic no doubt. It's a league above your average ordinary every day weizenbock. \n\nL: Not heavy. The dark color comes from the roast. Now, I do remember them being heavier and more syrupy in days past, but this current batch I'm handling, not so. \n\nO: Smooth, clean, light, and look at them bubbles.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 12/15/12: Pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. As the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange to amber color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about thirty seconds leaving some messy lacing roaming all around the glass. The smell had a nice sweet to spicy blend of rye malt to come across in a nice sweet citrus way. The taste was mainly sweet and lightly spiced through the rye, a light citrus runs through and leads to a quick sweet dry caramel to spicy aftertaste. There is a sweet citrus finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Sticky sweet malty notes run over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good DIPA."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I don't usually review this sort of thing because I drink out of the bottle but because it is an imitation of a Belgian Dubbel it foamed up and would have had a huge head... a lot like me but I'm not a Belgian knock off. I have to slurp up the foam to keep it from overflowing like champagne and like champagne the foam wash fruity and light.\n\nInitially it smells like a white or blush whine but then a bit of malt comes through.\n\nThe taste is like other trappist beers I've had. It's extremely fruity with just a little malt and then some bitterness. Like some kind of sparkling wine/beer mix.\n\nIt's very foamy and smooth with a ton of soft carbonation. It's finish is lasting fruit and bitterness.\n\nOverall it's much like a few other Belgian Trappist dubbels, trippels and quads I've had. It's the best of those though. I would give it a 4.7 out of 6 as a beer but for the style it would get a 5.7.",

Dry, yeasty finish with just a bit of warming alcohol. Delicious and nuanced.\n\nF: Medium-bodied and hugely effervescent. Suits the style.\n\nO: Delicious beer, and by far the most authentically Belgian-tasting American version of the style I've ever tried. I'd take this over Chimay Red 10 times out of 10. If it has a flaw, it's that it's a bit boozy for the style, but that's to be expected with its 8.2% ABV. Beer of Fame tick 177/250. Cheers!",

Light but noticable. Some malts as well.\nFeel: Light bodied drink. Extremely easy to drink. smooth going down - almost can sip this as easily as water.\nOverall: Not bad! This beer is world known and I'm glad to have given a review about my experience with it. If you follow what I've said just know this beer is great and definitely worth the try.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cooked up some Irish stew for dinner. Not super traditional, as I had no mutton so I subbed in beef and I also added carrots with the onion and potatoes, but either way it was absolutely delicious. Had some garlic bread too. Decided only a Guinness could go with this meal!\n\nThe look is gorgeous in the pint glass. It pours a roasted dark brown/almost black colour, compared to the ruby-ish lighter colour of the draught. Not nitro, so the head is tan/off-white, and lasts about 4-5 minutes but the lacing is good.\n\nSmell was the most underwhelming aspect of this beer. It’s fairly classic, dark roast malts and a strong coffee aroma. But the taste is where it truly shines. \n\nStouts are my first and truest love, so I’ll be honest. Not sure if I got the freshest, best batch in the world or if other reviews are off, but this was phenomenal. It tastes incredibly roasted, almost slightly burnt at times, malty mocha savoury notes, very creamy, perfect amount of carbonation. Lasts very long in the tongue and mouth, exhaling toasty bready barley notes through your nose. Definitely more bitter than the draught, but not excessively so, the bitterness comes from the darkly roasted malt notes rather than a hoppy bitterness. The last notes after a sip, after they dissipate, is a light and sweet malt in the front of the tongue with mild toasty character in the back.\n\nThe benchmark for stouts, in my opinion! It’s somewhat straightforward compared to some others out there, but that’s okay. It’s classic Guinness flavour, doing what it does best, and I was absolutely floored by how good it was. Like I said, either I got a super fresh batch or something magical happened, but this was phenomenal!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drinking it out of the bottle. Good taste, not as flat as the draft of the same. Way better than IPAs. Continuing my quest to find the perfect beer, it’s a snipe hunt, but journey is entertaining. Next stop is Pilsner Urquell. You should see the crazy selection at the tiny grocery up street in small town. Crazy selection. Like the 5.3 % alcohol. \n\nThis is probably not a summer day beer. But great in winter. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 11.2oz glass bottle\nThe look is fantastically dark doesnt let any light through. A tan head that's fine on top bit through the glass the bubbles look larger farther down. This is a traditional CO2 brew only draught is nitro. But the head retention is epic and leaves a layer of foamy head even after sitting for over 15 minutes of slow drinking (and forgetting about it) heavy heavy lacing.\n\nThe smell is rich with vanilla and roasty bitterness, maybe some light coffee notes. The fermentation character is present but subtle and there is a light tartness on the nose. Overall creamy and sweet smelling though. \n\nFlavor mostly follows the smell but with more almost savory roasty notes from the malt very smooth and enjoyable, but not very sweet as should be expected from guiness. Some bitterness from the hops bit nothing major just offering balance. Some of that fermentation character does come through slightly as well but not very noticeable. Almost too easy to drink bit very enjoyable.\n\nFeel is creamy yet smooth and very easy to put down not watery and is a bit thick but still quite drinkable. If it came in cans you might be able to shotgun it (but it doesnt) quite a lot of flavor for that though.\n\nOverall a good everyday stout that gives you more than a macro but not to much to be something you cant put down at a party or offend peoples tastebuds with something unfamiliar.",

Popping the cap off, the only thing coming from the bottle are a few small wisps of white vapor that doesn't bring any scent with it. Two fingers of root-beer-float-colored foam slowly settles into the opaque dark maple syrup liquid in the glass. Not syrupy to pour (unless you admit to dousing your waffles), there is a scent in there that isn't too far off maple syrup; not as sweet, but has a vanilla caramel aspect in amongst toasty malt, and even a little red wine. Man, this is smooth. For all of the foam on the pour, there is very little in the way of carbonation to interrupt the flow past the tongue. A slight hint of sweetness at the very beginning morphs into more bitterness at the end that serves the palate in combination with the sandwich.",

I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 650 ml bottle, as Southern Tier Imperial Crème Brûlée Stout, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks: At 9.6 ozs. should have poured it into a smaller glass. LOL. Nice thick creamy head about 1/2 inch tall. Great lacing on the glass. Smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom.\nSmell and Taste: This beer really does resemble Creme Brûlée. Vanilla, and burnt sugar on cream. Great combination. \nFeel: Nitro makes it smooth and soft.\nOverall: This its one of the easiest beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Bumped the OA score down some because of the short pour. Should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint. At least it would have come closer to filling my glass. I would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink, like desert.",

Boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time.\n\nFinish leans toward the bitter from the coffee, the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though.\n\nViscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little, but it’s a desert beer in every way, so this wasn’t surprising.\n\nNot a daily drinker, good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I wish I could give these folks a ZERO but its not an option. The Creme Brûlée beers were over pressurized and for the first 3 packs of 4 beers, I opened them over the sink as they would fizz on opening. The beer was in an area with no sun and a constant 69 degrees. A few days ago 3 beers of a four pack exploded. The tops pushed up and blew off. One top severed completely where the flat and round part of the can connect. Two of those cans shot 20 feet into my home spraying beer as they traveled. The third shot upwards to the ceiling. It was a 5 hour clean up job and we are still finding areas we missed and hand washing items that had to be rack dried to remove stale, very sugary, beer. Calling friends, family and my boss to tell them to remove the gifted beer from their home was amusing. The manager where I bought them said Southern Tier had other recalls on their nitros for the same reason so BUYER BEWARE. I called the company and left a message for quality control to call me. That was three days ago and nothing. Clearly Southern Tier does not care about customer service or their customers experience with their product. Had they called back to discuss the issue I would continue to buy their beer. Instead, they have lost a customer for life. There are just too many other good brews out there that I can try instead.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured out of a 12 oz bottle in to a pint glass, this beer pours a very dark brow, almost black color with a tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured. Head settles eventually to a pretty thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer of foam on the beer's surface with good lacing. Aromas of roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars for a bit of additional sweetness. A very decadent chocolate flavor here indeed. Has a crisp, slightly oily, also smooth and creamy, full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and slightly dry aftertaste. An excellent beer all around.\n\nEric",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is nicely balanced and smooth, but with a sharp hop bitterness that evens out well. Excellent",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I normally am not a big fan of IPA's but this one is really good. It is not overly hoppy and bitter, which is a plus in my book. It does have a citrus tang, which is not overpowering and is actually a nice flavor. Anyway, I recommend this to those who normally are not IPA drinkers. Founder's seems to make pretty good stuff.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;L: Golden yellow. Clear. Super foamy so pour cold and gently.\n\nS: Piney and resiny (almost soapy) to the extreme.\n\nT: Reminds me of a Benjamin Danklin from Fat Heads. I'm pretty sure that &quot;Wet Hop&quot; means they use an actual plant, and it tastes like an actual plant. That said, I can count the number of commercial brews with actual plants on them on one hand, and this is one of them.\n\nF: I hope you like alpha oils.\n\nO: It's a Fall to Winter seasonal and if you get a supply it will hold you over until Lake Eerie Monster and Danklin come out.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A perfectly festive beer for October and then the holidays...\n\nThis is one of those smacks-you-in-the-mouth hoppy beers. Calling it hop-forward really doesn't do it justice. Great lacing to go along with a copperish colored beer, and the smell is not only citrusy but fruity at the same time. The only nit I have has to do with it's somewhat watery mouthfeel, but it's mostly overlooked by the overall experience you enjoy with this IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a translucent orange with a white head that eventually dissipates after a minute or two. Even just opening the bottle you're met with a bouquet of floral hoppy goodness. After pouring it you get the full citrus tropical mango smell with very slight hints of pine and guava. The taste is very fresh and tropical with notes of pine on the finish. It's more balanced in the hops and malts than other IPAs with a caramel like sweetness shining through. It finishes with a slightly spicy hop bitterness and is slightly more carbonated than usual. This one drinks incredibly easily and definitely an ipa that distinguishes itself from the pack in drink ability coupled with a great flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazy deep copper color with a nice foamy off white head that leaves sticky lacing in my glass. Fresh hop citrus aroma, sharp citrus flavors, medium body. Every drink makes you want more. A very well done IPA."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A Saison found the day after Saison Day. Better late, but unfortunately, this was the only one available. Two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It's a light amber liquid, really not much different in color than most lagers. There is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. A nice modest and enduring white head is included. The glass lacing is even less. The smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. The taste is yeasty and perfume-llke, but mildly refreshing. It certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an IPA. Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee. Yet, for a once a year change, it wasn't such a terrible thing.",

Overall impression from the esters is leather and hay. For spices pepper and cloves come to mind. Dry at the end with a short lived after taste.\nMedium mouth feel, with effervescence. Excellent carbonation.\nVery refreshing, lighter summer ale that works year round. I would think the yeast flavors will change depending upon the time in the bottom.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours a near completely translucent pale straw color with two fingers of snow white foam on top. Head retention is great, with a pillowy layer of foam lingering long after the pour. Aroma is grapefruit, cracked black pepper, biscuity, bready and earthy malts along with very light herbal, resiny hops in a sticky mash-up. Strong dark fruit yeast easters punch through towards the finish, with a little clove. It's slightly sticky with a hearty Belgian quality. Flavor profile is clove, cracked black pepper, grapefruit, tangerine, and herbal, floral and resiny hops. Underlying notes of biscuity, bready, caramely and lightly earthy malts round out the flavor profile and provide balance. Focus is more towards the heavy Belgian yeast and clove and bread qualities. Mouth feel is medium-thick with an expansive, effervescence that doesn't just settle on the tongue, instead igniting, adding a touch of texture after the initial sip. Overall, flavorful and balanced with a good punch. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle Date: 2016\nPalate Contaminants: other beer\n\nColor is super dark brown that doesn't let any light through, even at the edges. Head is relatively dark, like a chocolate mousse, and the carbonation is fine.\n\nSmell has a lot of prunes, and it's fairly floral. Slightly metallic. I hope I didn't let it sit too long.\n\nMaybe I did. Prunes are still there, and there's lots of charred barrel. Some vague red wine grape, too. Any chocolate is not from the usually eaten part of the plant, more like tree nut husks. I might have a better impression if I was having it with barbecue. Yeah, there's oak, but it doesn't stand well as a flavor in this brew.\n\nAlcohol is pretty well hidden, and the weight is medium for type. Aftertaste is metal and charred wood. Carbonation is fine, but prickly with a swish around the mouth.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bomber into pint glass. Aggressive pour yields a substantial, persistent dark tan head. Dark brown looks black in the glass. Initial impression is dark chocolate, oak, coffee, and roasted malts. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is medium thick, but I was expecting thicker and creamier. Alcohol is remarkably well hidden. Finish is somewhat bitter and a little astringent. Not my favorite Imperial Stout by a long shot, but not bad.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just when I thought I had reviewed every Yeti out there, here comes one I haven't. Man these have been around, 10 years ago, these were pretty highly sought. Don't hear much these days, but that shouldn't take away from the beer's goodness. Pours a rich black with 2/3&quot; brown head. Aroma hits the standard roasted and chocolate malt combo along with a sturdy presence of oak on it. Did not know it was both french and American, would say the American is the stronger of the two in this beer, whereas usually french is more noticeable for me. Definitely fits the &quot;oaky&quot; descriptor either way. \n\nTaste has a nice touch of chocolate to it despite having no chocolate in it. The roasted malt is so pervasive that you get a coffee like component despite having no coffee. Good brewing technique and ingredients there. The oak remains pronounced, the bitterness is real, the alcohol is relatively innocuous taste wise despite almost being 10%. Solid chewy mouth feel throughout. \n\nIts a good beer, should be interesting to see if it survives as bombers have fallen from grace, I believe they moved the base version into a 4 pack, so who knows what the future holds for this beer that probably deserves to be in the Hall of Fame at this point.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours jet black with a thick espresso colored head. Huge coffee aroma with loads of chocolate intermingled. Flavor is overwhelming bitter espresso, fudge, loads of dark roasted malt, touch of vanilla, tannins from the oak chips round off the bitter finish. Thick and viscous, full bodied with creamy carbonation. Overall a very Espresso flavored beer, aged nicely.\n\n12/11/18\nBomber dared 10/21/15\n4.5 rating",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not quite as good as the Espresso variant, but still very good and unique. Looking to see how this ages past 2yrs where I'll have to revisit my review.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2015 vintage stored lovingly, poured from bottle into the test glass.\nA - Chalkboard backdrop, conceals, determined carbonation. Proof is the relentless mocha cap, and fine French lacing that clings to the inside of the glass.\nS - Bakers chocolate, bourbon barrel, toffee, roast malts, hints of cinnamon, alcohol, rises off the glass, then followed by dried dark fruits, touch of coffee, red raspberry, and tobacco broad leaf.\nT - After that aromatic introduction the flavors follow quite well, add some tannin's from the barrel, black pepper, a touch of anise\nM - Large feel, rich and bold, starts semi sweet, transitions to a softer feel, bitterness is a theme, the finish is luxurious,\nlingering on the cocoa meets bourbon date.\nO - Glad to have experienced this with a few years of rest, the feel connotes dessert, the slightly boozy tends to the adult side of our desires. Well worth seeking out, I will try a fresh version against the last 2015 bottle I have resting comfortably. This will be a nice taste test",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The oak barrel aging definitely smoothed out the rough alcohol bite that the regular yeti has. In addition to, the oak barrel has also lessened the chocolate brownie notes that I got with the regular yet, Those notes have mellowed a little bit. It's easier to drink because I don't want to drink a beer that taste like a boozy piece of fudge brownie, but it's nowhere close to being better than the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. Cheers! A-"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2 inch white, billowing, creamy, thick head with very good retention, that leaves sticky lacing around the glass and forms a rocky, uneven surface as it does recede. Hazy golden amber with very active carbonation.\n\nStrong aroma; I can smell it while pouring. Bready, light fruit, and spice. Sweet-ish.\n\nThe initial taste carries indistinct fruit - pear, perhaps, bread, floral, and peppery spice. A solid bitterness begins in the middle, along with some citrus, and continues into the finish and aftertaste. This is the most bitter of any tripel so far for me. The finish brings a bit of an earthy character. The level of bittering is in APA territory, which I was not expecting. In fact, the package of flavors, with the citrus, floral, and bitterness, is more APA than any of the other Belgian-style tripel ales I had. It is very tasty, but certainly different from others in the style. While the aroma seemed to promise sweetness, the finish is quite dry.\n\nMouth feel has a moderate body with the carbonation bubbles active on my tongue.\n\nOverall, a tasty beer, nothing out of balance, but a bit of an outlier in the company of the other Belgian tripels. It definitely brings more from the hops (citrus and bitterness) than do the others.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Lovely surprise. 33ml bottle purchased at grocery store in Belgium. Poured into IKEA 8 oz. glass. Surprisingly light, spicier and hoppier than I expected, and while you can tell there's a lot of malt involved, crisp, not sweet. Very smooth drinking and no alchohol heat - wouldn't guess it's a tripel. Not a lot of depth, but has the distinctive Belgian yeast banana-y flavors. A fastball right down the middle — nothing fancy, but a very nice example of the style. In the upper range of the 20-odd Belgians sampled this week.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Sampling a 330cl bottle at cellar temp poured into my chalice. Picked up at a beer shop two weeks ago and in my cellar since then. L20-540 on the label is closest to a date stamp I can find.\nThe beer pours a rich copper color with lots of fine suspended sediment floating around. A fluffy dense head of bleached white foam rises up 2 cm and almost overflows the glass. This foam sticks around as a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass. this lattice clings on throughout the tasting.\nAroma is some bready malts and fruity pear notes with a bit of general spiciness, never any booze notes. \nFirst sip reveals a medium body with soft and gentle carbonation.\nFlavor is some bready malt, green apple and pears and a bit of sweeter spices, maybe coriander. This isnt cloying or a candy sweet beer but Im not getting any sort of bite from hops nor peppery ABV. I just drank Allagash Tripel before this one and found these to be fairly different beers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Shared half a 12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. One finger foamy light head. Cloudy dark wheat color. Thin lacing.\n\nS - Light bready / cracker malts. Some heavy spice along with hops.\n\nT - A mix of malt and dry hops. A good mix of light malt and light bitterness. The floral taste hops have a little sourness. The bitterness is more pronounced as you drink.\n\nF - Medium-to-thin mouthfeel. Foamy carbonation. \n\nO - Overall this is a fine beer, but tried it immediately after the Chimay Blue, and this Chimay White was not as well-liked. I’m glad I tried it and would recommend it to people looking for a tasty light hoppy beer, but I’m not going to add it to my rotation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy, amber colour. Even with the most careful of pours, a three finger tight and dense head appears, with another finger tall rocky, foamy head. This is my usual glass goblet, but I don’t know what happened, tons of bubbles are running up all over little spots on the glass. As if there were nucleation points on the side, which there isn’t. As I waited to pour the rest of the beer in, I realized… the head is not collapsing. Not after 5 minutes, not after 15, and not even through the whole half hour I drank this beer. Something happened I’ve never seen before which is that the head actually grew in the initial minutes of the pour and the rocky foamy head coalesced into the middle of the glass like an actual mountain. I don’t know if this was just some crazy unique thing, but it’s so gorgeous looking I honestly want to give it my first ever 5.\n\nSweet, delicious doughy yeast on the nose. Caramel malts, tasty spices such as pepper, coriander, a hint of cinnamon. A bit of banana and cloves here too. Sugared apricot for the fruity notes. It’s a Belgian, and even more it’s an abbey beer, they just always smell so good. \n\nTaste follows the nose and then some. It is not disappointing at all. There is more balancing hop bitterness here than other Tripels, not citrusy, but a little bit grassy, funky and floral. Doughy yeast and moist, chewy bread flavours are unbelievably pleasant. Tripels and Quads can aim for a few different categories, some have those fruity esters like Westmalle, some aim for the sweet malt rum raisin flavours like Abt 12. Chimay White aims for a pleasant balance. There isn’t as much raisin, rum, dark fruit flavour here however, as the floral and mildly funky, wheaty malts balancing the sweetness and bitterness is more this beers thing. Gentle spices dance throughout the sip as well, mostly cloves. Mild funk adds a slightly savouriness to the beer. Toffee, caramel, and dried candy fruit rinds can also be tasted. \n\nPleasant and subtle finish that is dry in character, this beer is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Bittersweet on the palate as it dries. \n\nChimay White occupies a unique space in the Tripel category, but definitely deserves to be ranked higher. It stands out from the crowd and has its own little niche of flavours, enough to stand beside other unique tripels like Westmalle, Tripel Karmeliet, Rochefurt, etc. It’s not quite as malty and sweet as others, but still has pleasant chewy doughiness to it. It doesn’t have the deep molasses, rum, raisin character either, nor does it have tons of fruity esters. It’s very balanced and yet despite that still carries strong notes of its own character. \n\nAs for all Belgian Abbey tripels, it’s phenomenal. You really can’t ever go wrong with these brewers in this style!",

The balance of malt, hops and yeast is just absolutely superb here, with some sweet caramel malt and toffee, bitter and citrussy hops, as well as fruity and spicy notes that complement each other incredibly well.

Apricot prominent. Seriously deep and mystical.\n\nVery citrussy. Really overpowering, though also enjoyably intense. Better than Delirium Tremens as it has much more levels of flavour. Also, better than Duvel for the same reason. The balance of elements is mastered at a much higher level, this is a truly complex flavour on the tongue. The fizziness lasts for about a minute, and constantly changes taste. This is more than just a beer..! It is a creation of pure elegance and complexity. \n\nIs there a bit too much bitterness and orange peel flavour..? For some people, yes. It really depends on one's tastebuds. \n\nIt does have elements of Duvel. Though it takes to a new level. However Duvel limited edition tripel that I had a few weeks ago is as good as this, though more apricotty.\n\nFor me Chimay are the best Belgian Trappiste brewers by far. Blue is still my favourite ; )",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Maybe not the prettiest triple. it has a great Belgian funk but is a little rough around the edges.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells funky, fruity and spicy. Like a spiced wine with funky yeast.\n\nIt tastes like sparkling wine, cinnamon and other warming spices. It's also fresh and sweet.\n\nIt's thin with a ton of bubbly carbonation. The finish is dry, bittersweet and long.\n\nOverall it's a brilliant triple. I give it a 4.8 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: golden amber in color, hazy. A very large, soft, white head. Head lasts awhile, medium-high amount of lacing. \n\nS: As usual for triples: Forward notes of banana, clove, coriander, yeast. Some notes of hay. Taffy and fruit. \n\nT: Hops spice comes out here. Tangy. Still has that banana and clove. Tiny bit of apple. The hops balances back the sweetness.\n\nF: Not overly heavy, this triple doesn’t have that molasses feeling of heavier beers in this category. Medium bodied, high carbonation.\n\nO: A top triple for sure. It has its own character that I’m having a hard time finding which other triple is closest in profile. Not very sweet, not very spicy, nor is it very syrupy heavy. Balanced and mellow.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look : Into an Averbode Tulip, she sparkled and foams as she pours. Head dissipates evenly and mildly.\nSmell: Light when cold, Warms up to hop and fresh hay \nTaste: Most North American tasting Trappist I have tried. Big and hoppy, with a slight ABV bite. She is bitter but has complexity of sugar and molasses when warming. \nFeel: Rich and soapy texture (in a good bubbly way) that is reflected in a lot of West Coast IPA's. Texture is slight syrupy \nOverall : In a blind taste test I would identify this as as west coast hoppy IPA with a high level of richness. But what do I know ,I'm drunk half the time from drinking beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours hazy, golden straw colored with a huge billowing white head that takes forever to dissipate down. Aroma is very spice forward but in a soft and pleatsant way as opposed to harsh. Lots of clove and some cardamom. Bubblegum and some other nice fruity esters. Taste follows in that it’s definitely spice forward, but it’s a unique spiciness even when compared to other tripels. My beef with some of the not so well done tripels is that they can be a bit dense with limited drinkability but that is not the case with this one. It’s hard to explain but the spice, although very prominent, is of the lighter variety meaning less astringent bite. It lacks some of the fruity/estery/yeasty component of some of the style, not necessarily detrimentally so but it does lack the depth and complexity of my favorites.\n\n4.25/4.25/4.25/4.25/4.25",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - Golden/honey with a frothy white head that dissipate somewhat quickly leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing \nS - Belgian yeast and bright fruits along with hops, floral and earthy notes \nT - Follows the nose - bright fruit esters - pears, apricots, apples - along with Belgian, bready yeast and hops along with floral and earthy notes - a good amount of spice as well \nF - Light to medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp.\nO - A very good Triple, but honestly, my least favorite Chimay (but still a fantastic beer)"

Forms a half-finger of pale tan head that vanishes swiftly to a ring.\n\nS: Chocolate and coffee notes dominate the nose, with an underlying backbone of loam and some faint tobacco hints. As it warms, the nose remains similar.\n\nT: The taste follows the nose rather well, at least while refrigerated. Cold coffee and cocoa, with some loamy and tobacco notes. As the beer warms, a rather large bitter ash/pine presence swells up out of the background to claim center stage and hurl everything else into the background - apparently a hop presence that overwhelms my odd palate. Alas.\n\nF: Full and thick, like drinking a warmed syrup.\n\nO: While cold, I enjoy this stout. As it warms and the hop presence manifests, I unfortunately am not as able to enjoy it. Ah well. Please take my taste and overall scoring numbers in reference to the particulars of my palate - though as I enjoy other hefty IBU stouts like Old Rasputin, I feel validated in actually rating and scoring.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle into a beer mug\n\nL - Dark brown/black, 1-2 fingers of light tan head which settles down to a 1cm thick layer which is unusually dense that sticks around, sticks to the glass very thickly with fine lacing. Beautiful.\n\nS - Dark roasted malt, brown sugar and caramel, with the tiniest bit of licorice in there, no hops that I can spot. Solid stout bouquet.\n\nT - Smoke and blackened malt with very dark chocolate, small but sharp hop profile, licorice is nowhere to be found, the flavor is all somewhat muted actually, almost like everything has been watered down. Feeling pretty letdown here.\n\nM - Medium-heavy body, carbonation is moderate, at least it does drink like a real stout\n\nThis one is all over the place. It's gorgeous, it smells great, the mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Everything except the actual taste is here. Wish it had some more flavor, this shouldn't be the factor dragging down the rest of the beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A very nice looking beer pours pitch black, and dense. I did not expect the slowly rising head you get on bigger stouts one a 6 % one but that’s exactly what happened. A slow to rise creamy mocha tan looking head. Then it settles into rocky terrain creamy froth. As I stated a very nice looking beer. \n\nThe aroma to me is big in burnt and roasty. The things that come to mind for me are dark chocolate and dark roast black coffee. Also get a touch of something licorice like. \n\nTastes is nice burnt dark roast coffee. It also reminds me of those dark chocolates that are high up in the cocoa %. I’d even say there is almost like a burnt tobacco thing going on. \n\nMedium bodied but super smooth. It’s almost creamy because of the carbonation. Very nice big bitter lingering finish. I swear it’s almost like smoking a cigarette with coffee aftertaste. I haven’t had a cigarette in ages but you know you can never get that taste to leave. That’s what this beer does but in a good way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured moderately hard from a bottle into a snifter glass, quickly forming a few fingers of frothy brown head that slowly faded to heavy and leggy lacing. Deep brown body, totally opaque. Smell is a bit of licorice, moderate and not overpowering. Taste is malty in the background, some bitter chocolate and coffee, and ending with an aftertaste of hops. Drinkable, but really not my kind of stout with the bitterness and hops. Not quite medium bodied, moderate bite of carbonation. Drinkable, but just not my style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nAn impressive, double finger of creamed mocha froth floats steadily on a lake of imperturbable black. But while the head is twice as strong, retention is half as long. What little lace it offers comes in jilted, broken webbing.\n\nBouquet:\nChestnuts and sips of black coffee hiding in a vast field of dark grains. Hops appear and disappear on the horizon, too distant to rightly identify. While crossing that grain field, straining to get a closer look at those hops, you'll sometimes trip over a gnarled root of baker’s chocolate.\n\nFeel:\nSlender and supple, like tucking the tongue under a cooling bedsheet. A low yet continual presence of breezy bubbles brings the hidden hops forward during the linger.\n\nTaste:\nReallllly subtle toasted dark malts speckled with droplets of silky, chocolate milk and topped with crushed chestnuts. A lick of licorice bitters and herbal hops chase away the sugar, maintaining the manly lineage a traditional stout should boast: smooth, roasty, and mildly bitter.\n\nOverall:\nExceedingly mild, the casual drinker may have trouble tasting anything other than “dark beer.” A good starter stout for the uninitiated.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A classic American stout. I highly enjoyed this, the chocolate and coffee is balanced well with the Itty bitty licorice finish. For some reason I think I like this a bit more than anticipated. Definitely getting again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev As a new Michigander, I will be exploring the breweries of Michigan.. here is my first entry from Bell's Brewery, their Kalamazoo Stout. Upon opening, an earthy, hoppy, slightly metallic smell greets the nostrils. The brew pours dark, and forms a respectable mocha colored head, which modestly laces as you consume. The taste is good.. a bit overly hoppy to my taste buds, but the hops, and malt form a tangible licorice note atop the chocolate and coffee blend expected from a good stout. The mouthfeel is nice, substantial but not sticky.. this stout goes down smoothly, It tastes better as you go.. I'm looking forward to my second one, already. We have a winner here!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Seems like here lately the IPA craze (not that I mind it) makes it more difficult for me to find the dark beers I love here in Ga. \nBut I came across this and I am a fan of Bell's. So I bought and quaffed and enjoyed this stout. It is a solid, very good beer. Nice thickish pour, dark head. Smooth, complex dark malts some nice bitterness and alcohol at the end. If you are a stout fan you will enjoy this one. Another good beer from one of my favorite breweries.",

Some dark chocolate is there too, with a black licorice flavor. Surprisingly sweet for such a dark roasted malt dominated taste. After taste trails off with more a dry char.\nFuller mouth feel. Has some minor fizz in the mouth. Good carbonation.\nSuch a tasty beer, with its touch of sweetness posed against the dry dark roast/char/black licorice. It may not be sessionable but two of these in medium rapid fashion will be quite a treat (must like the dark roast and black licorice side of the taste profile).",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just a plain good Stout. Coffee nose is prominent, but I drank from a bottle, so take that as you will. Get a good black licorice finish, which I didn't know I would like but it fits this really well. Coffee/chocolate is more on the front of the taste. Overall really well done basic Stout"

One of the best looking beers I've ever had--color of a porter on the light side with a head of an IPA. Laces beautifully. It has a short, hoppy nose. Taste is excellent with the dry hops coming out from front to back of the mouth. Feel is a bit boozy and ever so slightly overcarbonated but that's the only real downside. Superior brewmanship from Firestone Walker.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reviewed off a note I made back in 2013 or so, even though the review is being submitted in 2020. Pours inky black, with a tight, small ecru head. Good lacing. The smell is not roasty, but lightly floral and fruity; more apple than berry. The taste is of a smoky, bitter roastiness. There’s a bitter aftertaste, but a clean finish. It’s like bitter chocolate, with a hint of ashes, leaving (perhaps despite these similes) an overall quite good impression. The feel is that of smooth, foamy carbonation. Great beer!

When I bought this it was sitting in a refrigerated cooler at a grocery store, and the date on it was 12/19/14 (at over 7 months old); my guess is, being chilled, it retained most if not all of it’s hopped flavor. It was a very good beer, with lots of hop flavor, and a very heavy mouth-feel. It poured very dark, with a nice, light, caramel-colored head. It is one of the better (if not one of the best) IPA type beers I have had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Firestone Walker Brewing Co. &quot;Wookey Jack&quot;\n12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, &quot;BOTTLED ON: 01/05/16&quot; so a year and 5 months old\n$3.99 @ Total Wine &amp; More, Cherry Hill, NJ\n\nNotes via stream of consciousness; A friend of mine introduced me to Wookey Jack about a year ago. He had a 6-pack at one of his parties and I ended up drinking almost the whole thing. It immediately became one of my favorite beers. I love that it's hoppy, but not so much so that the malt can't compete, and that the rye shows clearly; and looking at what I've got in front of me, given that it's well over a year old, it's surprisingly hoppy - I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. Anyway, I'm not sure when this was discontinued but I haven't been able to find it - I'm sure there are fresher bottles around, in fact this one from Total Wine &amp; More was probably bottled before the ones that I got from my friend! I bought it anyway, despite the price, because I like it that much; and to be honest, upon tasting it now the malt has held up extremely nicely as well. There's a touch of oxidation there, sure, but it's not bad, I'm still enjoying it. All of the dark chocolate is there, the softer fudge-like and caramel notes, the roastiness, the spice from the rye, and the pine and citrus from the hops - and if there's one thing that's missing it's that the citrus seems to have waned a little. Oh man, I'm going to miss this one. Hopefully I'll come across some that's been discounted and I can buy up the lot. I said before that if the new Leo v. Ursus beers were all as good as the Forte it would be worth it to discontinue some others, but sitting here with one in my hand I doubt that. This is the best black rye IPA that I've ever tasted, and probably one of my top 10 favorites - or at least one of my top 10 favorite dark beers, that's definite. A moment of silence. ... ... ... Wookey Jack, you will be missed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The appearance has a black body with a three finger off-white foamy head, leaves some clingy slightly foamy lacing in rings. The smell has some slightly roasted coffee. There is some rye, slight citrus/pine coming through in a spicy sort of way. The taste is mainly bitter, some slight coffee - but mainly subdued, hopped - yes, but balanced and extremely flavorful. There is a dry yet bittersweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, its about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable - maybe perhaps, and the ABV slightly felt. Overall, I’d say this is very good for a Black Ale and I would come back to this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a standard 12oz into a short stem tulip glass. 8.2% ABV.\n\nLook: Awesome jet black color, almost no head of foam, trace amounts of lacing.\nSmell: Roasted malts, sweet chocolate, hints of coffee. Very subtle pine as it warms.\nTaste: Much more hop forward. Bitter, piney, much more coffee. Even malt character that gives it a necessary balance. Really nice profile.\nFeel: Low but sharp levels of carbonation, smooth but sticky. Pretty light body.\n\nGreat beer overall. Incredible aromas balanced by a hop forward , malt balanced Rhye IPA. Exactly what you'd want and expect from the style."

Despite being a few months past its suggested best before date, the beer drinks surprisingly easily. The blending of sweetness and sourness is superb, while the mildly toasted malt adds an excellent level of depth and complexity.\n\nPouring temperature: 56 °F; bottling data: Best before 2021-11-26",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured semi vigorous, was late getting phone and head had dissipated to what you see now. It is actually pretty appealing though, a nice dark brown/red hued color with a creamy ring around the glass. Some floaties hanging out too.\n\nSmell is interesting and very unique...I keep getting all sorts of different smells each time. First it was all acetic, the came some tart cherry, then I got a weird funky note that almost reminded me of cheese, yes its definitely there, but it only shows itself every now and then; last note grape skin. At this point I'm very curious what this one tastes like...\n\nWow, that is certainly not what the nose told me it would be. Sure the sour and acetic are there but it is actually a lot sweeter than I would've ever expected. It is almost like cherry candy at first that quickly goes tart, reminds me of sour patch kids in reverse. There is also some baking spice notes that were no where to be found on the nose. I didn't pick up on oak initially but it does show itself in the aftertaste fo rme. \n\nMouthfeel is medium, typical belgian carbonations, a beautiful combination of both sweet and mouth puckering sour; they mingle on the tongue in perfect balance.\n\nTrying Belgian beers like this is always a treat for me. I don't drink them often but every time I do it seems I find myself being taken on a sensory trip all over the place. So many different aromas, then tastes and all always balanced in such a perfect way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a deep dark amber-cherry colour, the light carbonation at first might fool you as it grows into a two inch bubbly head, that collapses into a persisting one inch, soft fluffy head that lasts well over ten minutes. The lacing is off the charts on my tulip glass\n\nWhile many beers have that citrus zest smell on the nose, Duchesse has much more of a juicy smell instead. Dark cherries and malt are strongest here, Oak-y wine like must smells swirl around as well.\n\nThose wine like notes are up front for sure, the sourness is a light, tart cherry, and general fruitish notes (green apple, blackberries, oh, and wine grapes of course with that sourish thick skinned vinous chew). Nice subtle long finish, the malt backbone lasts the longest, and the gentle sourness finishes very sweet. \n\nDisagree with the review(s) that said it was one dimensional. This absolutely opens up, not just as the beer warms, but on the sip as well. The Oaky, wine, grape must notes are strong at first with the sweet sourness before opening up with some dark cherry notes. Mouth watering at this stage. And yet, it finishes dry and you get the real malty sweetness, notes of apple, blackberries, maybe raspberries but I’d at least say general juicy tart fruits. \n\nSoft carbonation that creates a gentle sip that goes down easy, but enough lasting carbonation to support a head that collapses into a thick fluffy one inch line that lasts almost the entire duration of the drink. Gentle sour notes pucker the tongue slightly before opening up. \n\nI haven’t had many Flanders red ales or lambics, krieks, etc in a long time so I can’t say this is a benchmark, but it certainly feels like it. Overall the looks, tastes, smells of this beer are gorgeous and it’s not overwhelming on any one area to scare anyone off. If you want a beer that goes hard in any direction I’m sure you could find it, but Duchesse de Bourgogne has the balance and yet complexity to absolutely satisfy, a gorgeous well priced sour",

It does provide some balance but for the most part it’s a sweetness bomb which admittedly I find a bit surprising. I do get some oaky notes to round it out. Very good but almost too one dimensional which again I am shocked by. 4.25\n\nM/D: Full bodied but not heavy, carbonation perfect, some mild puckering tartness made it more drinkable than it otherwise would be. 4.25\n\nO: Overall it’s a very good beer. Not my favorite style, nor is this my favorite in the style, but I recognize and appreciate that it’s one of the standards. 4.25",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 5oz pour for me in a flight at Raleigh Beer Garden.\nA: Looks like a dark black tea.

Follows the nose, but not overpoweringly sour.\nM: Light bodied and fairly acidic.\nO: A really great beer, certainly worth trying.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1519\nI thought I had consumed this beer, only to learn I have not. My co-worker raves about this beer. Years later, I am finally going to drink this beer ( I probably should have done this long before now). The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a one-fingered head. The creamy tan had so-so retention and left no lacing on the glass. I was hoping for some type of lacing or retention. The color of the beer is SRM 20, dark amber brown with a reddish tint. The beer is clear with some carbonation bubbles suspended mid-liquid. \n\nI get candied cherries followed by sourness. Another whiff I smell, oak, wine, malty sweetness, toffee, raisins, and earthiness. I want to say it smells like cough syrup but not with all the nastiness that cough syrup embodies. I love the aromas of this beer it is fragrant, sweet, and sour. \n\nA huge punch of sourness, followed by candied cherries, and oak. Next, I get sherry-like wine flavors, vanilla, malty sweetness, and raisins. I taste apples, earthiness with a touch of funky. \n\nThe mouthfeel is puckering, tart, and dry. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and full finish. \n\nThis beer is awesome, it has big rich flavors. Leaves your mouth watering but finishes dry. I can see why this is a timeless classic. I would not mind a few more of these beers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a bottle, stamped Best before 12-17-2021.\n\nJust a fabulous beer! Bright yet deep, tart with a rounded malty sweetness, fruity and funky. Well balanced with many layers of flavor.\n\nWorld-class for good reason.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Combined my reviews of 2017 and 2021: Brewery says it is a Flemish Sour Red Ale: Nose of red cherry wine with some must; deep red hue with tan lacy head; light and smooth mouthfeel with medium effervescent carbonation; taste of sweet, earthy cherry w/ some raspberry &amp; oaky notes and with just a bit sourness. Finishes crisp with a lingering fruit taste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 750ml bottle. Pours a dark red with a thin lacing of bubbles. Smells of sour cherries and straw. Medium body. Cherry flavor with some earthiness and a slightly sour finish. An excellent beer, and very distinct. Could probably pick this one out in a taste test!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (250 ml bottle). Pours with a large thick head, colour is copper. Intense aroma of red fruits, red wine vinegar and horse stable. Lovely sour flavour of fruits, notes of spices. Aftertaste says &quot;more, more!&quot;. A great beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On the attack I get black cherry the middle stays fruity maybe a touch of caramel. The finish drops off fairly quickly. The tartness you would expect seems absent. Still one of my favourites.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Among many of sours this is might be favorite that I can get here in Nashville. I buy a four pack once a week. It is splendid in every way. I love Rodenbach, Mort Subite among many, but amazing balance, mouth feel, the oak, champagne-like even. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is without a doubt, a benchmark, a standard, for any sour style beer. It is ridiculous that you can get such a great beverage for such a reasonable price. \nIt holds a dark amber/ruby color, with a white head that quickly returns to the brew hence it came.\nIt has a sweet and fruity smell to it, smelling of cherries, leather, and wood. \nThe taste is a superbly balanced sweet cherry, with a full bodied almost creaminess to it. I believe part of the &quot;creaminess&quot; I get is from the excellent mouthfeel. One could equate drinking this beer to drinking a tart cherry pie filling. An amazing beer."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Almost no scent when the cap comes off, this porter developed a nice tannish head but quickly lost it. The color is a very transparent reddish mahogany and is accompanied by the subtlest vanilla and a little cream... like the liquid accompanying a chocolate-covered cherry. The taste is totally vanilla, kind of like what my younger self imagined vanilla extract would taste like. It feels very much like a cream soda... round, easy to drink, and some carbonation going down. This is fine, I may get it again if in the mood for a lighter porter in warmer weather.",

The vanilla wasn't perceived whatsoever and left me with a horrible lingering aftertaste.\n\nFeel: Medium to high carbonation.\n\nOverall: Very disappointed with this one, particularly the taste. The vanilla wasn't at all noticeable and the flavor profile was unexceptional that left me with a bad aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle - review from notes - my 1337th review\n\nSolid and classic craft beer. I remember buying a case of this shortly after turning 21 and discovering the wide world of beer.

No lacing\nSmell: Like a Stout with hints of chocolate, no vanilla\nTaste: Stout not overpowering. Vanilla almost nonexistent. Some notes of cacao, but not much in aftertaste.\nFeel: Nice carbonation, coats mouth.\nOverall: This would be good with spicy food or just sipping. No guzzling, would be a waste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.69. Poured into a nonic pint glass.\n\nL - Motor oil black with a one-finger thin tan head.\nS - Toasted cacao nibs, toffee, and cavendish tobacco. Very malty backing.\nT - Rich cocoa and vanilla on the front. Notes of fig, lightly roasted coffee, and cola. Finishes with toasted chestnut. Little bitterness.\nF - Full in body. Smooth. Not too filling. Light in carbonation.\nO - What a bang for the buck! A good beer throughout, with not much too add but one critical note: not enough of a bitterness, nor much of a hop backing. Other than this, I will buy this again if given the chance.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice chocolate color with a nose and taste of vanilla and chocolate. Probably needs more bitterness to cut through the chocolate taste. More like drinking carbonated chocolate then a Porter"

Strong aroma of fruity American hops, old marmalade, caramel and crystal malts, alcohol. The flavour is very sweet, and the alcohol is not well hidden, but soon overpowered by a massive hoppy attack. Warming mouth- and throatfeel.Maybe too much of everything, but still a guilty pleasure to drink.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The pour from a tap into a plain pint glass brings an amber-brown fluid, closest to 16 on the SRM chart. There's a nice light biege head atop, but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma. There is rich body here, as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing. The initial taste is good, malty but with some hop contributions. What kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste. If a honey like finish to a beer sounds good, here it is.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle pours a deep amber in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine. Full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of pine and grapefruit. More of a strong IPA.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real treat, bought as part of a mix-a-six at Bartonsville Giant. Poured out of 12 oz. bottle into pint glass.\n\nL: Pours a rich cascading copper amber, with a big solid head that slowly recedes, leaving plenty of sticky lacing behind. Hazier than most beers I drink.\n\nSmell: Sweet but rich. I detect rye bread, malt, toasted caramel, and honey. Notes of vanilla and tobacco emerge as it warms. Also a very mild, almost stale fruit note.\n\nTaste: Luscious and luxurious. At first the hops tingle your tongue with bitterness, then you get the sweetness of the caramel and malts. There's something complex and smokey towards the back of the throat, like beef jerky. No burn whatsoever, and no tricks to hide the booze. For a beer of this alcohol content it is remarkably well balanced.\n\nFeel: Very little carbonation. Still, the beer doesn't feel flat or sticky at all. Very smooth and clean, somewhat chewy and thick but not overly heavy.\n\nOverall: Great beer. Most of the time I'm too broke to buy stuff like this but I decided to treat myself tonight. I'm glad I did. This isn't the most refreshing beer but it might just be the most palatable high-ABV offering you can buy.",

Alcohol is definitely present\n\nT: Starts off with a bready sweetness, culminating in a spicy grapefruity taste before a mild hop bitterness creeps and fills the mouth. The hop sensation lingers for awhile, creating a slight warming sensation.\n\nO: The alcohol is hidden well. This is a sticky sweet malty beer that's saved by a hop cleanse after every sip",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Old school West Coast IPA. Piney and bitter with some citrus elements, backed up by a silky, full mouthfeel. Pours a bright coppery orange with a thin, persistent head. It's possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual West Coast IPA and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which I forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!).\n\nCheers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very piney full ipa. Stronger flavor than most. Too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. All around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. I am a bigger fan of the Nelson and og lemon haze styles.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wonderful beer. Piney aroma along with citrus. Also has an earthy vibe to it. Taste pretty much follows the nose. Earthy pine dominates. Medium body and carbonation on the feel. This is an outstanding representation of what I would classify as a West Coast IPA. I use to be able to get this beer at Total Wine in Virginia in bottles. Then it disappeared. Now I can get it only in cans which is better than not at all. It has become my everyday go to session IPA although the cost continues to go up. Still well worth a try.",

The caramel character is a bit stronger than I like but it works fine with the resinous character. Bitterness is strong. Clean, minimal ester profile. Alcohol is evident on the aftertaste.\n\nM: Medium-bodied, creamy feel with a very dry finish. \n\nO: A well-crafted WCIPA -- less caramel malt character in the aroma and flavor and this is a top 5 overall for me.",

Incredible lacing. \nAroma of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange peel and caramel. \nTaste is very well balanced between malt and hops. Orange, grapefruit, mango. Caramel sweetness.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Growler into pint glass. Pours a crystal clear gold (SRM 5-6) with a persistent off-white head. Great lacing. Initial impression is citrus (pineapple, lemon, grapefruit), pine resin, and a light touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side of medium. Finish fades to a slight bitterness.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured moderately hard from a can into a snifter glass, forming a couple fingers of tan head. Head soon faded to nothing. Translucent orangey-brown color. Smell is definitely hazelnut, but not super strong. Taste is some hazelnut and roasty undertones. Tasty and mild. Pretty strong carbonation and light bodied. Not bad overall, an easy drinking hazelnut porter.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very slightly hazy mahogany brown color with a nice moderate tan head that retrains well but produces very little lacing. \nThe aroma is warm fresh bread, slightly sweet malt and just a hint of nuttiness.\nThe taste is light sweet malt, biscuits, a touch of brown sugar and nicely light hazelnut with just enough floral hops for a nicely balanced overall flavor, nothing overpowering or too understated \nThe body is light/medium and very smooth with mild carbonation. \nOverall, just a really pleasant brown ale, very nice.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nutty: my favorite.\n\nL- On the pour I got a 1finger head, as I drink there is light lacing. It is a deep reddish brown and the beer is almost hazy which is interesting, hopefully normal, but kinda cool.\n\nS- the hazelnut flavor definitely comes through and it compliments the yeast they used nicely. Not a lot of hops on the nose, but that's kinda the point.\n\nT- A warm (feeling/tasting) malty tidal wave of flavor dissipates into a pretty subtle hazelnut flavor with very light bitterness that also reminds me of a nut, not a lot of hops again.\n\nF- the feel is mostly consistent and overall enjoyable but if you think about it there is a slick lens that comes right before a dryness but that's quite easy to move past\n\nO- the flavor profile carrys this beer into nut brown ale stardom, as the hops from american craft brewing remove some of the nutty qualities from this english style. Sam smith still beats them out, but this is much more accessible and attractive to modern audiences.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nuts. Nuts. Nuts. Good. Better. Best. Nuts! (&amp; a fine nectar 'tis!)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance - Pours an opaque saddle brown with a slight tint of dark amber and burnt orange when held to a light. Little head that disappeared immediately. No lacing left on glass.\n\nSmell - First aromas are chocolate-caramel candy. Noticeable maple syrup sweet smell. Slight nutty and toasted grain scent. No detectable hops.\n\nTaste - Molasses, deeply roasted grain, chocolate cookies are the prominent flavors. Faint nuttiness and herbal or grassy notes were detected. It wasn't nearly as sweet as the aromas led me to believe. While there is a mild sweetness, there is enough bitterness to perfectly balance things. The aftertaste is both sweet and bitter and thankfully it lingers for a while. While the hazelnut flavors are barely there, this brew is still delicious.\n\nMouthfeel - Body is full and it hangs on the tongue for a while. Visually, the carbonation level looked low but in the mouth its actually moderate. This brew finishes dry and clean. \n\nOverall - Disclaimer: Like an old man, brown ales are one of my favorite styles. I like malty, slightly sweet, full, dark toasty beer. This one hits the spot. The sweet/bitter ratio is right, it has some complexity (which many brown ales don't), and the after taste is terrific. This review is based off of my first sample of Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. This won't be the last, though. Very highly recommended.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L- dark brown, with a light, airy head. Almost like cola when poured except the head is controllable just like any other beer.\nS- I could definitely get a lot of hazelnut off the smell. It took a second to hit me, but when it did, it was all I could smell. Didn’t really get much else off of it, the hazelnut was just too strong.\nT- Honestly, tasted like they mixed ale with hazelnuts and vanilla extract. Definitely wasn’t my thing. I had thought going in there may be an element of sweetness, maybe some brown sugar, and let me tell you there is NOT. None whatsoever. \nO- Maybe it’s just not my thing, but I will not be picking up another of these any time soon. I have a tongue for stronger, bitter beers, and heavy porters and stouts but this one just tasted dirty. Very bitter, very hazelnut. Not a big fan. Which sucks because I hate putting a beer down, but this just ain’t for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A good English brown ale. Liked the hazelnut &amp; mild bitterness flavors. The ABV mixed well with the complex flavors. Overall, a good start to the style- not too strong or watery.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Slightly cloudy brown body; fairly thick and dense light khaki hued head. Warm beer wort smell; roasted grain and nutty. Sweet and nutty flavor with a nice touch of vanilla; hazelnut; mild to moderate bitterness. Medium body; a bit of residual sugar feel yet also a tad watery overall; semi-sweet feel throughout.\n\nA very nice brown ale overall that combines some nice hazelnut elements to the overall taste and aroma.\n\nServed at 53° F and &quot;CANNED ON 05/20/20&quot;.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I get brown sugar and bread when I smell it, with just a hint of alcohol.\n\nIt does taste like roasted nuts and has a yeasty bready quality.  \n\nIt's thin and has medium carbonation.  The finish is nutty, yeasty and lasts.\n\nIt's still fantastic.  Not as extreme as Founders Underground Mountain Brown but far more complex than New Castle.  I give it a 5.4 out of 6.  It still may be my favorite but there are a lot of browns with more going on.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Color is just lighter than coke or Pepsi\nScent Is cream soda and hazelnut \nLots of carbonation and if there was chocolate in this they could call it Nutella\nFeel is nice.\nOverall like I said a little chocolate this beer would be awesome",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a cola brown with a puffy 1.5&quot; head that settles relatively quickly to a thick coaster of foam, no lacing. Nose a mix of mildly sweet malt, light cola, earthy noble hops, and a strong hit of ground hazelnuts. Taste is primarily hazelnut as well, backed by subtle sweet malt and floral hops. I found the malts and hops to clash a bit, but the nut flavors elevate the beer overall. Mouthfeel is a little on the thing side but with good crisp carbonation. A good, lower ABV alternative to bigger peanut butter/nut stouts and porters if looking for something nutty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a nice caramel color accompanied by a tan 1/2 inch head with good retention. Smells malty upfront, biscuity &amp; of course has a nice subtle hazelnut aroma. Taste is very malt forward, subtle amount of baked biscuit roasted flavor, then the nutty flavor from the hazelnut which is really nice, but not overpowering. Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth finish. Really nice beer, I was stoked that the hazelnut flavor of this brew was subtle &amp; didn't take away from any of the other flavors in this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 11/12/20\n\nI love hazelnut. I think it's under utilized in beer, as I've run across maybe 2 or 3 of these beers. Anyhow, I knew I couldn't pass up on a hazelnut brown ale. It seems like an oddball style to add hazelnut to, but I guess nut brown ale is a thing so it isn't too far fetched. Let's dive in\n\nPours a murky brown with ruby highlights and 2 fingers of tan head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nThe layering in the nose is pulled off wonderfully, constantly switching between dessert-y and nutty malt. I'm picking up on aromas of dried nuts, creamy hazelnut, milk chocolate, toasty bready malt, earthy hops, and rich toffee\n\nUnfortunately, this loses quite a bit of its charm when translated to the taste, but it's still enjoyable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dried nutty malt, earthy hops, a touch of dark fruit, and toast. The swallow opens up and sweetens things, bringing notes of rich hazelnut, milk chocolate, raisin, bready malt, caramel, and a touch of astringent hops\n\nA light medium body pairs with gentle tingly carbonation, resulting in a somewhat thin but still flavorful beer. Finishes almost completely dry, with the sweetness offset in the aftertaste\n\nThis one was a bit of a rollercoaster. If everything followed the nose, this might be one of the best brown ales I've ever had. But alas, that's not the case. For what it is, though, it's still quite tasty"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The complex banana-forward taste and the beautiful medium-bodied mouth feel work together to make this beer an immediate favorite.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer is exactly what I thought, years and years and years ago when I first heard of real craft beer, that it would look and taste like.\n\nPours a beautiful light orangey straw like colour, moderately cloudy in the glass. Four inches of rocky creamy head, like a little mountain, abide in the glass for a long time, even when it collapses 15 minutes later there is a layer of 1 inch thick head remaining. Simply put, it’s absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThis has a genuine barnyard smell on the nose. This is a generic phrase you hear a lot for saison and some other Belgian ales, but it is absolutely true here. Maybe because this is brewed at an actual farmhouse (they also produce bread locally and cheese you can buy) Leather and straw smells are strong, with some mild yeasty notes. Earthy, dirt like mist hits with the yeasty smells, like opening a wooden door on a dew-y, mildly humid summer morning. I’m not kidding, that’s not just flavour description, it really smells like that.\n\nTaste is wonderfully complex. You might get hit with lemon upfront on some sips, or grassy hop bitterness on others, I think it depends how much you sip with how much air. Evolves to a mouthful of sourdough bread and yeast after a few seconds. Barnyard funkiness is all over, waning in and out of the other tastes. Yeast, citrus, fresh straw can also be noted throughout the tasting.\n\nMedium body that ends with a sharp crispiness and dryly. Goes down smooth and easy, with the absolute perfect amount of carbonation. With my reviews I’ve always tried to do short, 3 paragraphs with straightforward descriptions, and I tried to keep it here too. Everything I wrote you absolutely will smell and taste, it sounds like a flowery review but that’s just because this beer is just that good. I’m looking forward to getting a bunch more as soon as possible and cellaring a couple bottles for the future. An absolute benchmark of the saison style and a recommendation to absolutely anyone who loves beer. Saison Dupont is remarkably complex and maybe most importantly, unbelievably delicious.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Continuing my trend of reviewing world classics, I pour a glass of Saison Dupont into a pint glass. The beer is a beautiful hazy unfiltered yellow-orange amber with a huge foamy white head. Ah yes, lots of barnyard funk on the aroma. I like that and you really only get it in saisons and some sours. Fruity esters dominate; orange, lemon zest, and some herbal clove and other spiciness. The taste is delicious. Like nothing i've ever had. A drying palate of barnyard funkiness (think of a rubber like quality) splashed with orange and lemon. The beer is kind of juicy. Slightly grassy, herbal, and fruity hops. There is a lot going on here. The finish is dry and clean with just a residual funkiness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1541\nStaying with the Belgium beer this farmhouse ale is next. I used a tulip glass and the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a massive three-fingered head with excellent retention. The off-white head is airy and foamy. Gobs of lacing were left on the glass as it dissipated. . The color is SRM 6, pale straw with amber hues. The beer is mostly clear with a few rouge yeast bubbles floating. \n\nThe initial aromas in the beer are straw, horse blanket, and sour lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, floral, a touch of fruity esters, wet grass, and a dank basement. Taking a few more minutes smelling the beer I get a hint of banana and white pepper.\nThe flavors in the beer are straw, funky barnyard, a touch of horse blanket, fruity esters, cloves, banana, mowed hay, toasted crackers, bay leaves, tarragon, and morning dew. \n\nThe mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, crisp, and slightly tart. \n\nThe body of the beer is light, medium carbonation, and medium-light finish. \n\nThis beer is fantastic, the only thing that I am not liking is the beer has a touch of light struck. The flavors of the beer would make Sunday dinner on a cool summer night amazing. The beer will pair well with any communal foods. I am enjoying this beer on a hot summer day. Cheers!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured cold from 750-ml bottle into a champagne flute. Quite the gusher: a tentative pour foamed right out of the glass. Once things settled a bit, the appearance was impressive. Clear, light golden colored body, with a voluminous snow-white head that exhibited good retention and some spotty lacing. Aromas and flavors are typical of the Belgian yeast profile (e.g. clove, banana), with floral, herbal, and barnyard notes. There is also a slight umami character. The finish is dry, with pleasant bitterness and a peppery spice kick. Great table beer that complements all sorts of food. Overall, an outstanding beer and well worth seeking out."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2019 vintage. \n\nAn aggressive pour resulted in a small amount of short-lived head that once gone left behind a cool looking swirl. Nice legs. Color is dark brown with a hint of light showing through around the very edges. \n\nAroma is fantastic and bursts from the glass. It's sweet with plenty of vanilla. There are some underlying notes that I'm having trouble distinctly naming, but they add a nice depth to the aroma. \n\nTaste is really nice, and quite complex. There's a roastiness that wasn't apparent on the nose, with the vanilla &amp; sugar present but well balanced. Hints of fig lurk in the background. Overall, it's plenty sweet but hovers just under the threshold where it would be too much. Feel is medium full. Very smooth, and low carb. An easy sipper. \n\nOverall, this is excellent.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 Vintage\n\nPours pitch black, oily and viscous. A thin, weak mocha colored head forms on the beer momentarily before dissipating leaving no residual head behind. The head retention is not great, but otherwise its a nice looking beer. The aroma on this is interesting. Initially I got dark fruits when I poured it - lots of prune, raisin and even some port, along with a lovely vanilla note. As Im sitting here sipping it, I am getting much more of this umami, almost soy sauce aroma on this one. Now that I have got that on the brain I cannot shake it. That being said, there are some notes of roasted malts, barley, coffee, and vanilla. There is a certain sweetness to the beer that is clearly present on the nose. \n\nThe taste is very complex with a lot going on with this beer. So there are the notes of roasted malts, with notes of dark fruits - prunes, raisin, port wine - all coming in. There is a surprising level of sweetness to this beer that accentuates those fruity notes. As those move across the palate there are notes of fruity coffee, and some piney hops. The finish is where that umami/soy character on the nose comes in on the flavor. The finish then has that umami soy with a slight salty note - although that may just be my mind playing tricks on me from that soy flavor. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish as well with some light piney notes. Feel is medium bodied but rather viscous. Moderate carbonation.\n\nOverall a complex and delicious Russian imperial stout from Three Floyds. I can certainly see why this beer earned the reputation it enjoys in the craft beer community. That being said, I can also see why it does not have the same cache it once had. Its an old school beer that just does not seem to fit in the current stout trends.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Green with sparkles wax - 2017 - enjoyed July 2021.\nPoured pitch black with a burnt coffee color head and lacing. The aroma was milder than expected but still very good; malts and coffee and dark cocoa, no hops found.\nThe taste was able to meet my elevated expectations. Of stouts I have had, I don’t think that I have had one better and I’m not sure I’ve had it’s equal. All the malts and coffee and cocoa (flavors from the malts and hops as no additives were used to my understanding) merge into a flavor that fills your mouth and makes you want more.\nThe feel was excellent, a bit thinner than I expected but that was when I still thought it was BA, which it apparently isn’t. \nOA - outstanding stout. The only knock is that it’s so freaking hard to get.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fantastic beer. Unique sweetness from the Indian sugar. Glad to try.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 Vintage. \nSuper creamy, full body, tons of chocolate and roasted malts. Coffee note is mild in both aroma and taste. No soy sauce anywhere; super smooth, thick, oily and full body. No alcohol burn but a nice warmth on the finish. This bottle was only slightly aged but I still have a 2nd in the cellar which I'll age for many more years ;)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 bottle purchased from a private collection for $25. Super excited i found it. I like the mystique surrounding this beer. Only available once a year. Only available at the brewery in Indiana. Rated super highly. Many derivative versions that are also rated highly, if not higher and single bottles that trade for hundreds of dollars in private circles on the internet. The multicolored waxes that adorn each year's vintage. The black wax that adorns mine. It's my son's birthday, so that seems like a good occasion to drink it. \n\nPoured out a heavy dark brown, nearly black, with a creamy one inch head that dissipates into a ring around the glass. Scents of dark raisins and other fruits, a bit of vanilla. The smell isn't very strong, rather on the weak side so i had to swirl my glass several times to release the aromas. Upon sipping, I'm greeted by raisin and rich sweet chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Perhaps a chocolate covered cherry. Notes of char and leather are present. Coffee is used in this brew but it's not too strong. The brew is mostly a sweet wash, with just a little bit of bitterness to balance it, hovering on the back end as it washes down my throat. Dark Lord is thick and syrupy, just the way I love my stouts, and sticks to my lips, sweetening them long after the swallow. Overall this is a beer to enjoy as a meal in and of itself, as it is hearty and rich, bold and strong at 15%ABV. \n\nI've read that this stout was there before stouts really came into their own, and that the overall field has risen to meet the standards this beer once set. It's better than some stouts, like i like it better than Old Rasputin, but in fact it is comparable in overall savory flavor to some Hoppin Frog stouts like TORIS. So while once upon a time some may have journeyed far and wide to experience this flavor, i think one can obtain beer just as good as this without searching too far from home. However, what an experience! And I feel like I've now joined a secret club. The Dark Lord club.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle, 2009 vintage, kindly shared by gunnar. Black colour, hardly any head. Aroma of heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee and liquorice. Intense flavour of roasted malts, coffee and liquorice.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Thank you eppie82 for this one!\n\n2019 Vintage (purple/glitter wax) poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. \n\nPours a deep cola brown - fairly fluid, abd sitting coal black in the glass, with no real head. A swirl forms a dark brown collar and some cling along the glass. \n\nNose: Big, bold roast lends some baker's chocolate, cacao, burned toffee, brown sugar, and a deep, almost savoury character. Yes, I understand where the &quot;soy sauce&quot; descriptor comes from. A bit of a meaty character, with some char and marmite, but this seems to be a product of the heavy roast. Some underlying dried cherry dark fruit. Definitely unique. \n\nPalate: Before I start, I will say that the savoury soy sauce note is strictly limited to the aroma. It doesn't show up here. Moving on. A few things stand out first. One, this stout is sweet. Very sweet. That unique concentrated cane flavour of the Indian sugar is present, along with the sweetness. Lots of sweet, tarry molasses, brown sugar, and even a blackstrap rum thing going on. The vanilla is definitely lending character, but not like a &quot;vanilla stout&quot; - it's tame, identifiable, and well-balanced. I'm not getting any coffee. The malt itself is so classically Russian, with big, super dark roast, earthy char, and all those bold roasty notes. The hops are also very old school, with earthy, leafy bittering hop character meshing with the roast. Approaching the finish, vanilla fades, and the blackened roast and earthy hops take over, pushing some sweetness out, lending some earthiness and char, but very little bitterness. The finish highlights this, with a touch of molasses. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: While it didn't appear so on the pour, wow is this one fudgy. Full-bodied, heavy, thick, and chewy, while not crossing the line into syrup territory. It isn't close to BBT or Assassin thick, but it's certainly in that same vein of luscious and fudgy. There's actually some nice, fizzy, albeit fine effervescence that pokes through a bit. Definitely some residual stickiness. \n\nOverall: This is an interesting stout. Today, we're inundated with all of these mega pastry stouts brewed with half a bakery. While there are &quot;adjuncts&quot; in here - vanilla, coffee, and Indian sugar, those flavours are dialed way back, to the point of almost feeling like a plain stout. It's the sweetness that really stands out. On top of that, it's the only dessert stout I've had that retains that classic Russian Imperial flavour profile, and that's unique. Picture a dessert Russian Imperial Stout. If that sounds good, then this will likely deliver.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very solid Russian Imperial. Definitely not the whale I chased, but very solid either way. A bit of an odd aftertaste, but enjoy the front forward and solid.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I love this beer. The old school whale. I still want to drink it and I still open these up for special occasions. I do think it's not the best fresh, so it's always nice to have older years on hand to drink.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Some people call this Soy sauce, which I cannot agree to at all. Even the bass beer itself is really really good. Tons of everything and obviously very great balance. (having said that, you oughta try one of the DL variants!)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Finally got my hands on a bottle this year. As good as expected. Surprised by the amount of dark fruits",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 vintage sampled day 2 of availability. Nose is prominent malty roast and dark chocolate, light coffee. No soy notes like some people mention in previous years. A bit thinner than past years, but still oily thick in feel and appearance. Flavors are actually discernible when fresh: char, malt, molasses, vanilla, coffee on the finish. Not a sugar bomb like it has come to be known for.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 version, picked-up at brewery, poured into Goose Island BCBS glass and allowed to warm.\n\nL: Dark motor-oil type look. 1/2F tan head with OK retention, leaves sheets of lacing and a floating cap.\n\nN: After an hour or so of warming, I get hints of vanilla and jaggery (what they call Indian Sugar). Definite molasses/brown sugar-type implied sweetness. Malty, no real notes of coffee or alcohol. Definitely understated to my nose.\n\nT: Taste more or less follows nose, but still muted. Really searching for that coffee and might not taste it at all if I didn't know in advance it was in there. Vanilla/brown sugar really the pre-eminent taste, though with some restraint. Malty, not much evidence of high ABV heat. All in all feels very muted as far as a world-class stout goes.\n\nF: Full bodied, little to no carbonation. Well-balanced, especially with control of ABV on the back end as you only get a tiny bit of heat at 15%, and that is impressive. Sweetness similarly is well-controlled, as this easily could get cloying, but falls short of that. The ABV certainly helps in that regard. But there's just not enough taste and I don't think any amount of aging will make that better since it already is well-melded and pretty drinkable.\n\nO: Big 3 Floyds fan and this new one definitely runs laps around the disappointing 2015 I traded for a few years ago (can't account for someone else's storage). If it's me, I punch up the coffee. It's good, but would not drive to Chicagoland again to get this - there's too many good premium stouts here in the East.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 2017 version of Dark Lord. Nice and deep and dark on the pour. Very little carbonation. Nice thin tan head. The taste was sweet, somewhat of a surprise. A bit of cherries and some nice fudgy, almost burnt chocolate come at first.  Then a touch of alcohol finishes the taste with a hint of vanilla. Overall, very good."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Tall, white head from a VERY gentle, drizzle down the side pour. Audible fizziness as I pour, almost like a soft drink. Very good retention leaving sticky lacing (and a nicely laced empty chalice). Slightly hazy golden body, heavily carbonated.\n\nThe aroma is not too strong, but sweet. Bubblegum, and a bit of banana.\n\nThe flavor brings the tastes promised by the aroma, sweet bubblegum and banana. The middle has very slight bittering, which does not last into the finish. Behind the already mentioned flavors is a lightly tart fruitiness, perhaps pear (hard to tell) along with a semi-sweet component - perhaps even vanilla - and floral. The finish is creamy and smooth, with an aftertaste of smoothness, maybe from the soft carbonation that is hard for me to describe, spreading out on the tongue. This aftertaste is exquisite!\n\nThe mouth feel is quite smooth (yeah, I keep using that word), with a gentle carbonation on my tongue. Moderate body.\n\nKarmeliet is malty, smooth, and yet heavily carbonated with a huge creamy head, not very (if at all) spicy, several sweet components to the flavor without ever entering cloying territory and finishing only semi-sweet. The feel of the aftertaste is, as I stated above, exquisite. Wow!\n\nAn excellent tripel!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A cloudy orange hued straw color, super bubbly big soapy bubble head. Dissipated relatively fast to a thin layer of opaque white.\n\nNose is very banana, bubble gum forward, has an almost bread like quality to itself, a touch of something refreshing like apple.\n\nTaste is similar to the nose with all the same parts except the refreshing appleness is more noticeable and on the finish.\n\nMedium body but it drinks very light, the carbonation is big when it hits the tongue, almost bubbles up the whole mouth. A really nice minor acidity on the finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear, light golden body; lots of fine carbonation; immensely thick and billowy white head; incredibly dense, thick and sticky rings of foam. Outstanding fruity aroma and pleasant esters; floral notes; candi sugar; peach and green apple. Delicate honey and fresh cut fruit on the palate; moderate sweetness; mild spiciness, cloves primarily but also hints of nutmeg and cinnamon; light bitterness; slightly phenolic. Medium body; light velvet feel; dry mouthfeel overall.\n\nWhat a fine tripel! Gorgeous appearance and aroma with a fantastically complex and balanced flavor profile.\n\nPouring temperature: 54 °F; bottling data: 06/04/23E (neck label)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wonderful triple. Pretty much the industry standard for the style. Only the monks can do it better.\n\nFull menagerie of banana, spice, fruit goodness countered with the peppery yeast and strong malt. Wheat is detectable, and the oats must contribute to the body.\n\nThis tripel leans into the subtleties without hitting the Trappist level of nuance. Great beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey/peach/gold colored with a tall foamy head which dissolves into a long lasting thick film and the aromas of sweet malts, some lemon, some honey, flowers, and mild banana.\n\nSmooth rounded sweet malts with some apple, banana, clove, citrus zest, and honey\n\nA fizzy mouthful that finishes with a clean peppery bite and a slightly pithy aftertaste\n\nA truly excellent example of the style",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip. \n\nThe beer pours a clear golden yellow with about three fingers worth of fluffy white head that recedes slowly leaving behind bits of spotty lacing\n\nThe nose is grainy and yeasty with notes of lemon zest, banana, a slight bit of spice and just a hint of floral hops\n\nSimilar to the aroma the flavor is biscuity and zesty with notes of banana and yeast. There are also hints of spiciness and light fruits. Medium bodied and well carbonated with a sticky finish\n\nOverall this is really quite a nice beer, deceptively easy to drink for the 8.4% abv.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wonderfully balanced, rich flavor, not overpowering",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2oz bottle\n\nLife can be an utter nightmare, devoid of pleasures and amounting to nothing more than a rigorous course of turmoil for damned souls, so once in a while you need a reminder that there might be more to this realm, and this is one such reminder, in beer form. Looks like a snowglobe, filled with various films and floaters. Smells like warm grain and banana. Powdery feeling, dry, banana and clove and honey, sweet but w/ burps of fuel sitting at 8%. Thanks for the brief reprieve you Belgian wizards",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very nice beer, has a very nice initial taste followed by a sweet almost Honey after taste",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is pretty much my favorite beer. I consider it an all-terrain brew, perfect for any occasion and easily paired with any food. The flavor is delicate and even light, but with a complexity that reveals itself in waves. Banana, bread, champagne...the flavors keep coming. TK is the pinnacle of Belgian beers in my estimation, which is about the highest praise I can give to a beverage.\n\nAre there any downsides to the Tripel Karmeliet? Well, you have to pour it carefully, because it's got a head like a champagne afro. You don't want to just drink a glass of foam, do you? Also, if you're drinking it right after a potent stout or lemon-bitter IPA, you might not appreciate its complexity. Best sipped slowly and thoughtfully with some fine cheese, a backyard cheeseburger, a mushroom risotto...well, anything. The TK is all about enjoying the good things in life.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My virgin palate can definitely smell the banana and then taste the bubble-gum flavor as I reduce the head to nothing. Taking the whole beer into my mouth I feel a sharp carbonated re-interpretated sensation of the previous sensations of bubblegum and banana eagerly cramming themselves into my being. The journey of this beer describes a young person engaging on a first time landslide while embarked on a adventure not quite known. Highly recommended!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear, deep golden coloration with a large, fluffy head and visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy and caramelly malt and citrus zest, with estery hints of green apple and clove as well. Taste is an excellent balance of doughy, slightly grainy and caramelly malt, hoppy citrus notes and fruity/spicy yeast esters of green apple, banana, clove and peppery spice. finishes with a medium sweetness and some caramel malt, citrus zest and peppery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Effervescent mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium/strong carbonation.\n\nThis makes for quite a hoppy Tripel with some distinct, floral and zesty citrus notes in addition to those fruity and spicy yeast esters, with the spice standing out as well. There really is an excellent balance of sweet malt, zesty hops and fruity/spicy yeast to this, making for a brew that feels rich and refreshing, complex and easy-drinking at the same time, while the ABV is hardly noticeable as well and there really is a fantastic, full and effervescent mouthfeel to this. Overall, this makes for a great Tripel that is perhaps a bit more hoppy than most, but balanced so well that it really makes for an exceptionally pleasant drinking experience.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer pours a bit of a murky golden, blonde color. The head is 2 finger, white, fluffy, and frothy, however, there's almost no lacing on the glass as it dissipates. \nThe nose, well, maybe I'm weird, ok, I know I am, but it reminds me of a hefe. I get a malty, bread, biscuit aroma, with some banana and cloves? There's also a slight, wild, funky, floral aroma, as well. \nTaste - Am I drinking a hefe? I get the hefe flavors here. I get banana, I get cloves. I get a wild funky flavor as well. A bit earthy, a bit floral. This is confusing me a lot. \nThis body is pretty good. Full, and good for the ABV. \nI like this beer, but if you told me it was a hefe, all be it, a strong one, I'd believe you. Good, but confusing me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Patrickbaeki out Thailand ( Belgian )\nL : Golden blond with a fine good durable white head\nS : Fresh , fruity , grainy and hoppy.\nT : Fruity , malty with a slight bitterness of hops.\nF : Dry bitter in the aftertaste but still soft.\nO : Top beer for a terrace in the summer , very good tripel .",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 330ml bottle poured into tulip. I just realized that this is my 400th beer review, I'm glad I got something like this.\n\nPours a clear brassy yellow with two chubby fingers of off-white head that leaves some splotchy lace as it recedes.\n\nSmells of lemon zest, peeled bananas, apple skin, honeyed biscuit, faint bubblegum, dusted pepper and some lively green hops.\n\nTastes of biscuity caramel malt, honeyed apple and banana fruit cup, a bit more lemon, coriander, more ethereal bubblegum, more peppery Belgian yeast and grassy hops.\n\nFeels big and jolly. Full bodied with frothy carbonation. Finishes off-sweet and a bit sticky.\n\nVerdict: Vigorously recommended. These robed weirdos clearly know what they are doing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Lighter and more crisp than other tripels, with a bready banana flavor and sweet citrus aroma. Only metric that falls short of a perfect 5 for me is appearance. Poured a nice thick head from the bottle, but a bit coarse compared to the finer, more creamy head on similar brews. Color is a bit too yellow as well, compared to the more golden amber tone that I find most appealing in this category.\n\nOverall, an incredibly aromatic and drinkable Tripel that easily earns its world-class reputation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smashing this Tripel like Ty Cobb is up to bat. This one roars as if The Big Train was pitching. Yes, large and in charge as if Kirby. F’ing Higbe walked into the room.\n\nI’m out."

Utterly ridiculous. People sound like they are reviewing a freakin cabernet or something. IT'S BEER FFS. Get over yourselves. This is a great beer. Very enjoyable. If you don't like it, great.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a crystal clear mahogany, half-inch off-white head that quickly fades, minimal lacing. Nose is light straw, lemon cleaner, and light roast as it warms - nothing objectionable, but nothing too prominent, either.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Feel is the main drawback here. Poured from the can into a Tulip, I got a slight metal taste like once so I don't think thats really a thing.

I buy a 12 when on sale..these were Friday special 12 pack $5 bucks..nice..so got two 12s. I prefer the taste (as most ) in and from the bottle.\nI would prefer more deep taste and a darker..and more then 5%. ABV\n\nBut when on sale..no brainer on $5 buck Friday at Albertsons..",

But I am beginning to learn what I like. I know it’s not a “true bock beer”, and I don’t care. This beer is amazing. I may just be some low-brow country redneck- based on the fact that I actually prefer my beer from a can, but I absolutely cannot express how much I enjoy this beer. My only wish is that it had a slightly higher ABV to give a little bite. Regardless- if you haven’t tried it, give it a shot and slow yourself to go to a happy place where beer doesn’t have to be super dark and complex to be good. Many folks are gonna hate me for my high review, but I will not back down. Shiner Bock is a high class, beautiful creation with history and culture, and is a true Texas treasure.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light biscuit and subtle noble hop nose. Light, slight hop and malt on palate. Crisp slightly dry finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Straw/pale gold, brilliant clarity. Head an opaque white with mid-size bubbles, lasts about 5 mins.\nAroma: White bread, toast. Light and quick.\nTaste: Malt: White bread, oats/wheat, nutty, very light caramel. Hops: Floral/lemony.\nMouthfeel: Light-bodied, slick-ish feel.\nOverall: Light, sessionable summer lager. Poolside beer. A little extra hop bitterness/bite than your typical. Lemony, goes well with pasta. Good by itself, inoffensive.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev As I sit on a rock in the shallow waters of the Pemigewasset River, I can't help but to sit an enjoy my fleeting moments of Summer with this years Summer Fest Lager. It has a pleasant golden glow that glistens like the water that runs over the white rocks. It is crisp like the brisk water that cool you off from the sun's August rays. Some earthy notes tickle your nose and you then taste this beer's lemony, malty goodness that ends with a slight bitter after taste. All in all a solid summertime lager, but nothing too fancy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look:\tLovely clear gold just what a pilsner should look like. One finger head that dissipated quickly. Slow rising bubbles but not a lot.\nSmell:\tEarthy spicy noble hops over a nice bready malt\nTaste:\tSurprisingly sweet at first. Bold and hoppy (like a pilsner of course, not hoppy like an IPA). Great balance between hoppiness and maltiness. And between sweet and bitter, obviously leaning more toward bitter.\nFlavor:\tTastes like a sunny afternoon in a Prague café. Herbal with lemon zest. Bready malt with a softer peppery bitterness.\nFeel:\tMedium mouthfeel, clean crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. Dry bitter finish.\nOverall:\tI have tried to steer myself away from drink all IPA’s all the time, so this is another in a stream of pilsners that I have tried. American Brewers are nailing pilsners, Everyone I taste is as good or better than the last. Looks great in the glass smells like what I used to think was a pilsner that was of European origin. When I was in Europe in 1980, I was embarrassed of behalf of American beer. The beers I drank in Europe inspired me to drink European beers for all of the 80’s and well into the 90’s. We obviously gained a lot of ground when IPA’s swept the beer landscape. I don’t know when American brewers began to equal the great pilsners of Europe, but they have.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light gold, pretty clear and a slight amount of head with some lacing. On first whiff you notice bready malts with that ubiquitous Sierra Nevada aroma that runs like a thread through most of their lighter ales and lagers. The taste is a nice peppery hop snap with a smooth malt backbone, biscuity, and a little herbal. It’s also well carbonated and super easy to drink on a warm day. This was from the second batch in June so there is no “fade” in this bottle. \nIn closing, what can I say that hasn’t been said before; it’s old reliable, SN, easy to find, the price is always right and they always do a nice job of coming close to the style they’re brewing with their own stamp on it. One bottle left in the second sixer and I do believe I’ll spring for a third with a heatwave coming this week, cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've only had this a few times, since I'm usually not drawn to lagers (except pilsners). But it really is a nice go-to beer when you want something simple and don't have much selection to choose from.\n\nPours with a transparent golden body and white head. Specks of lacing decorate the glass, but it's nothing to write home about. Great can art.\n\nBiscuit, lemon, lime and white pepper notes grace the nose, bringing a slightly funky malt base reminiscent of the kolsch style. Hints of basil and yeasty pizza dough on the finish. Simple, but nice.\n\nTaste is exactly as expected from the aroma. Just enough bitterness to call itself a beer. The hops are quite restrained and the lager yeast and malt shine. Farmy hay notes on the finish.\n\nSmooth and light texture. It could stand to be lighter, but not by much. It still tastes like food to me, which I consider essential.\n\nReally good for the style, appropriate for the weather and widely available. SN always delivers. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A - Pours a clear golden body, fat white head. \n\nS - Grassy spice hop, with just a touch of honey on the nose.\n\nT - Nice bright open with the honey note prominent, cracker malt middle, and a sharp bitter bite in the finish.\n\nM - Brisk carbonation, light weight, dry close.\n\nO - I pleasant summer drinker, as advertised.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: Brief bright white, pillowy head that recedes to a thin line; not much retention. Clear yellow straw, perhaps a bit darker.\nS: Dominant smell is lemon, and a bit on the soap/polish side. Metallic as it continues to warm.\nT: Hay, lemon up front. Does have some bitterness, but in an almost acrid kind of way. Rather unpleasant.\nF: Very round and full mouthfeel.\nO: Wish I was getting some of the yeastier/breadier notes others have mentioned, but as is, this one is a disappointment.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Super clear gold with one finger head. \n\nBarleycorn and wheats, lil hoppy, faint feet. \n\nFeels pretty good, semi dry/semi sweet. Balanced bitterness and malt fullness. \n\nPretty good, it’s a beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium-golden color with a strong white head that sits quietly for a while. SRM of 6. (4.25)\n\nAroma: Light aromas of orange citrus, apple, grape. Some bread dough sweetness. The aroma is subdued and subtle, but it has that classic SN orange citrus/nectar aroma. (3.75)\n\nFlavor: Initial flavors of yeast and grainy upfront. Followed by an orchard fruit quality. There's sweet orange &amp; apple juice. A slight bitterness comes through on the end, but the yeast finishes it dry. Again, the classic SN orange citrus/nectar flavor. Even a little bit of pine. (3.75)\n\nFeel: Light, crispy, well-carbonated. Good carbonation and yeast finish it dry with nothing left on the palate. Goes down extremely light. (3.75)\n\nCompared to Alaskan Kolsch 6/14/20: Pours a lighter color. More orange/nectar and apple juice flavors. Less malty sweetness and cherry. Overall, lighter and cleaner. \n\nCompared to Zipline Brewing's Kolsch 7/5/20: Pours a darker color. Stronger fruit and hoppy aromas. Less malty bread. A bit more of a citrus and crispy bite. \n\nCompared to Trader Joe's Josephbra Czech Pilsner 8/14/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. More orange dish soap on the aroma. Less bread. Dryer, crisper. \n\nCompared to Oberon 8/23/20: Pours a similar color. More nectarine/apple/bread on the aroma. Less dry orange. Overall, sweeter. \n\nCompared to SN Oktoberfest 2020, 8/23/20: Pours a lighter color. More pale malts and orcharfruit aromas. Less resinous orange/nectar. Slightly more tart and less bready. Overall, these are quite similar. I think we all know who copied whose homework. \n\nOverall: A pretty good summer drink. Not exactly a Czech-style pilsner. Not really in hardly any aspect except slightly bready. It's got more fruit and yeast, with little signs of any noble hops. I actually mislabeled this as a Kolsch. It has more Kolsch orchard fruit flavors. Lots of nectarine/peach/apple. It actually has classic Sierra Nevada orange soap flavors too. Finishes on the dry side, with less malts for a Czech pils and more classic and resinous Sierra Nevada orange pine. (Final Rating: 3.83)\n\n*Compare to a dense Kolsch*",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Light golden in color, clear and a vigorous pour brings on a good head that recedes leaving good lacing\nAroma: Pilsner malt, cut grass, slight lemon notes, and earthy and spicy hops\nTaste: Biscuit and cracker-like malt up intermingles with herbal, earthy, and slightly spicy hops in good balance. Finishes very clean and crisp\nMouthfeel: Clean, balanced, and light but not watery. Medium carbonation and a huge depth of flavor but not at all so that it leads to a heavy feel\nOverall: Awesome stuff. Crisp, balanced, and full of flavor. This has always been a beer that doesn't fit into typical style boxes IMO - somewhere between a Czech Pilsner, an American Lager, and a Kolsch for my palate. Honestly though, who cares - all I know is it is tasty and a regular occupant of my fridge during its seasonal release.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drank from a 12 fl. oz. can purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA\n03 30 20\nServed in a Willi Becher\n\nCrystal clear, pale golden yellow appearance. The body was capped by a fluffy, bright white, two-finger tall head that quickly dissolved. No lacing whatsoever.\n\nThe nose was super yeasty and dry. Big, crisp, powdery yeasty notes dominated. As the head receded, some crackery malts appeared. Bit of lemony tartness. Later, the yeasty notes continued to subside and the malt presence intensified.\n\nThe flavor profile was quite hoppy for the style. Like in the aroma, crisp, dry, powdery yeasty notes came through strong. Some crackery malts were noticeable up front. Tart lemon notes appeared in the center and on the back end. The beer finished with more lemon, bitter lemon peel and a crisp, peppery hoppiness.\n\nFantastic light and fluffy mouthfeel. The liquid contained a super fine, fairly zippy effervescence that turned pillowy soft and plush on the palate.\n\nLike most of Sierra Nevada’s offerings, Summerfest is a hop-forward take on a classic style. Although the hops seemed both excessive and overly bitter initially, this beer grew on me with time.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler.\nBottled 4/15/20\n\nI was a bit disappointed with this. It is crisp and refreshing but mediocre. The head was thin and short lived and it had a fruity overripe banana aroma on the nose. My biggest issue was mouth-coating astringency that was enough to be an annoyance. Perhaps it's chemistry and mine don't mix so well.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bright gold appearance, large white head, modest lacing. Biscuit-like aroma set in a hay field. Crisp edge to the taste, a bit spicy, tangled with herbal hops. Slightly bitter dry aftertaste adds to a balanced light-to-medium bodied refreshing mouthfeel."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer is way more balanced than your typical IPA. The first note was more malt than hops, which was interesting. Bread and toasted malt. Then the hops. Floral, slightly earthy, a bitnof pine. Balance is the big word here. Super drinkable. A go-to beer for sure.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A lighter IPA that I think works well as a tasty refresher.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12/11/14:\nAppearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good.\n\nAroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets.\n\nTaste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.\n\nA very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short.\n\nWait. I just noticed something. The box reads: &quot;Enjoy before Dec. 2014.&quot; No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...\n\nWhat's the paper on the bottle say? &quot;Rebel IPA is brewed with 5 varieties of West Coast hops: Cascade, Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook &amp; Amarillo, It's everything we love about West Coast-style IPAs, Big citrus &amp; grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful, refreshing brew.&quot;",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden yellow with A 3/4 inch white head. Moderate lacing.\n\nAroma is grassy, piney, fruity, cedar.\n\nTastes of pine, grapefruit, earth, resinous.\n\nMedium bodied, light carbonation. Semi-dry finish.\n\nLower carbonation than I expect from an IPA. Bottled 12/19. May be past its prime. still a good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wow!\nStarting with the look is good with abit of flatness. Smells great! Hoppy and truly aromatic like an IPA should be. Taste is amazing with abit of bitterness kick towards the end. Too say its fruity, it is definitely not, sweetness is very well balanced with bitterness. It will definitely play tricks on your taste buds. Definitely worth a try",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Picked-up a six pack of bottles at Long Ridge Wine &amp; Spirits for about ten dollars. Have had many brew from these guys before. This is decent, very malty. More of an English IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer pours a very pale golden color with a bitchin foamy white head. The smell isn't overly hoppy, but they are there. Small hint of pine notes with maybe a little flower to it. The taste is very clean &amp; this beer goes down easy, decent amount of hoppy bite to it. I would consider it a session IPA. It's more flat than it is carbonated, very light on the palate. This isn't a world class IPA, nor should it be, I think this is a very approachable IPA &amp; one that could definitely be crushed while grillin or chillin. Anyone looking to get into the world of IPA's could start with this brew!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16oz can, pint glass, best by June 2020. \n\nCrystal clear goldenrod with a whopper of a head! Two plus fingers of cratering new parchment foam rise and linger, dissipating slowly, becoming more craggy as time advances. \n\nClean, biting grapefruit rind, a trace of pineapple, some caramel peeking through as this nears it's drink by date, and Cascade floral-ness. \n\nI get a dose of biscuity caramel that's quickly doused by a hit of grapefruit and bitterness. Pine and mango develop and pass into a medium bitter finish that's mostly clean, but sports a little soapy pith. It's really quite a hoppy one. \n\nMedium bodied, though with more viscosity than normal for the style. The carbonation is medium-high and stands up to it. \n\nI come away almost embarrassed that I've always discounted this beer, so much so that I hadn't tried it until this monstrous deal of a case of 16oz cans for $12 landed in my lap. I have my vacation pool beer now. I appreciate Sam's homage to the classic American, almost West Coast, IPA. Even when almost six months old the hops are very present.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Found this one locally at Lucky's Supermarket as they are now having their going out of business sale. Not bad, not great but very drinkable. I wish I could have found this earlier.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. It poured a honey color with a 3/4” head and had a subtle hoppy aroma. Taste was very good with typical bitter-hoppy we expect from a mass marketed beer. This beer is very drinkable and would purchase again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (12 oz bottle, enjoy by DEC 2019; purchased single off shelf... poured into Spiegelau IPA glass)\n\nL: brilliantly-clear, medium-amber colored liquid... fortunate pour brings tight, crystalline, rocky foam from midway up the bowl of the glass to the lip... chunky, messy head holds like a champ till the bottom; several thick streaks of lace\n\nS: potent hop aromas immediately upon crown removal; in glass: pineapple, grapefruit, maybe a touch of mango... moderately bold, lasting intensity\n\nT: toasty crystal malt and bready pale base jumps out immediately in its foundation, relatively dry, while peppery, spicy-citrusy hops cut over the top... aftertaste has a bit of pine and herbal-grassy bitterness, moderate peppery spice humming along... crystal malt builds in aftertaste as it goes, but the hop static continues to weigh it down\n\nF: clean-cut, dry; delicate residual resinous and boozy streaks left across palate, slow flame builds a little warmth\n\nO: never tried this; have only found old, out-of-code bottles in my hunt for it as of late (discontinued?), so surprised to find one in-code and with some life left in it... it's a classic WC IPA, as billed, with a relatively crackin' execution, if not particularly distinctive in taste... would very much enjoy having one again if it was my best option (1570)"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This Neo-Berliner Weisse that is fermented with peaches is by far one of my all time favorites. A pale gold appearance with a nice white head. The Aroma makes me think of a peach orchid with a hint of lemon. The balance between fruit and crisp style with a bit of a sourness is refreshing . The mouthfeel is clean with a great finish. Summertime however can see this beer go down faster than normal.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is the rare beer that I actually prefer to drink directly from the bottle. For whatever reason, the peche / peach pops more that way. Drank it that way at a tailgate that was lacking glassware once, and now it 's my preferred modus drinkerus for this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a thin-walled glass goblet. Clear amber color, with a couple of fingers of white head. Good head retention, not much lacing. The tartness is understated, as is the peach flavor. Aromas and flavors of light malt, yeast, peach, and green apple. Very low bitterness, and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, this is very refreshing and lip-smackingly good. It would make an approachable choice for someone looking to get into sours."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev #96, yummy!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2018 Vintage\n\n750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!\n\nPours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75\n\nNose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25\n\nPalate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0\n\nMouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25\n\nOverall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than &quot;Plum Tuckered out&quot; by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look - fantastic black and thick with a great lasting tan head and rimming\nSmell - you can really smell it all. First notes of smell is the cinnamon and roasted malts with a slight chili pepper followed by cocoa and vanilla\nTaste - cinnamon and pepper with a slight sweet vanilla and a little cocoa\nFeel - medium body light carb with a slight cream\nOverall - tasty Mexican stout",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had this in August, then the 2016 version, + have tasted a few vintages before. Incredible solid imperial stout from the Floridian masters here! Super RIS",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.\n\n2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev To me this will always be the beer that started it all. Delicious, dark cherry and cinnamon taste. Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel. Tried it with some older folks who never had a craft beer before and they were sold!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours a brown-black with a perfect deep mahogany head which does not dissipate too quickly. \n\nA: slight oak and cocoa overpowered by cinnamon and a spiciness\n\nT: Fudgy up front followed by a perfect spicy chocolateness and really a great mole character which I what I think is their goal. Almost taste like a cinnamon graham cracker in the beginning. \n\nM: Slightly thin for a beer of this stature, but the medium body is welcome with the spice complexity. \n\nO: Finally glad I got to enjoy this one I’ve been seeking for years. It’s a well crafted beer and one of the best spiced beers I’ve had.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great go-to west coast ipa",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12 oz can into a Sixpoint can glass\n\nthe beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.\n\nLots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness. \n\nLike the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA\n\nOverall, a very good beer that I would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles, leaves some lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and pine aromas, hoppy citrus and pine flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear amber appearance with a large, off white head and good lacing. Appealing aroma of pine and citrus. Hop flavors are a bit more mellow than anticipated; more floral and herbal. Modest sweetness, but bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a lovely golden bronze color with an off white head. Smell is malt and citrus hops. Taste has floral and orange / grapefruit hops some pine resin and a sweet malt kiss. This is an IPA that is the way it used to be. Bitter hoppy malty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Ok folk's !!! I do not do alot of reviews on this site any more due to my general lack of enthusiasm with the hype of the Hazy IPA craze !!! Tropical this, melon that, no malt just hops and yeast and quite frankly it is extremely boring too say the least. There is no such thing as balance anymore. BORING !!!! \n\nThis is an old school IPA that is not geared for the hipster IPA scene. It has plenty of hop aroma and flavor that when paired with the selection of rich malts creates an exceptionally balanced brew. Yes I get it !!! Most younger folks will not appreciate this balance but I actually miss this style of an IPA !!! An IPA is supposed to be balanced !!!! Nowday's brewery's can just throw hops in a hop back with a tinge of pale malts and become an overnight success. Zero balance and flavor nuances. \n\nI give this brew two thumb's up because of the overall balance of malt and hops. This is what and IPA should taste like. I am bored to tears with the current IPA offerings from brewery's. No thought or balance just hops. I have zero respect for the brewmasters / breweries.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a sunburst orange with a lighter orange/yellow at the top. Slightly murky tint to it. Head is a finger of snowy white foam with modestly good retention. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, orange, mango, resiny and dank hops. Light bready, earthy malts add a bit of balance and 'boniness' to the back-end of the aroma. It's a pleasant contrast to the initial hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine, mango, resiny, herbal and dank hops with bready, earthy, toasty malts. Balance is great, with the hops out front and sticking to the tongue long after the sip. Mouth feel is lightly sticky with a light graininess to it. It has a medium to medium-thick consistency offering up a 'heavier' presence. Overall, hops are great and are contrasted well by malts; however, the focus remains wholly on the hops. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a deep orange, dark peachy color. A white and lacy head. SRM of 13. (3.75)\n\nAroma: Dank resinous melon, lime, pineapple, and red grape. A touch of vanilla yogurt with berries. (3.75)\n\nFlavor: Lots of lime, red grape and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of lychee and an almost plastic or medicinal quality. Finishes with rich caramel malts, yet a fairly strong bitter finish. A unique flavor, but also reminiscent of some of the first IPAs I've tried. (4.00)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied, Average carbonation. Lingering bitter pine and pith which is appropriate. Right in line with what an IPA should be. (4.00)\n\nOverall: Definitely a good IPA. Takes the IPA back to it's origins in terms of a hop profile. Reminds me of some of the first IPAs I tried. On par with what a good IPA should be. Nothing extraordinary, but a good rating for being traditional and accurate to it's origins. (Final Rating: 3.98)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Can Date: 6/12/19\nPalate Contaminants: none\n\nColor is a medium orange. Slightly murky. Moderate amount of fine head that doesn't hang around so long.\n\nLots of malt on the nose, but the grain evokes a wheat brew. The sweetness also contributes to a marmalade scent. Light bits of vegetation, specifically cilantro and moss. Overall, it could use some more intensity, though.\n\nBitterness up front right away, and too much of it. The moss is still there, but the sweetness and anything connected to it is buried. The bitterness even disconnects the malt from any sweetness, which actually makes the whole thing not so cohesive. Not that it's not palatable, there are just so many other good IPAs out there.\n\nGood medium weight, and the carbonation is pretty smooth. Alcohol about par for a sevener. Bitterness just continues in the aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Some of us get a soap odor and flavor that doesn't do it any favors. Its harshly bitter at points without too much nuance overall. It is serviceable, and would go well with a slice or two.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is it, the gold standard your Pilsner should strive for. Crisp, clean and refreshing. There's no faults it the execution, and nowhere to hide any if there were.\n\nThere's better Pilsners, but they're not necessarily available. Macro brew doesn't get better than this at least in the style",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The original Pilsner! It’s good to try these to have that good benchmark for future tasting.\n\nPours a crystal clear, light golden straw colour with a nice effervescent yet tightly packed, three finger head that slowly recedes over 5 minutes leaving a very circular, spotty cap.\n\nFairly savoury aroma, interestingly enough. A little bit funky and skunky, mild cheese in the savoury department but without being too musty. Clean aromas for the skunkiness. Gentle floral aromas and clean wheat and breads.\n\nA pleasant bitterness punctuates throughout the flavour profile. Taste follows the nose but it’s a lot cleaner and less funky than the nose suggests. Bready, wheaty, clean floral and grassy on the palate. A little bit sweet with the crisp malt flavours balanced by the grassy, floral hop bitterness.\n\nCrisp mouthfeel with medium carbonation, the large bubbles create a tickling, clean sip. Light bodied with a gentle, subtle but bittersweet finish. Dryish finish.\n\nIt’s an interesting beer for sure, better than any typical American lager macro. The skunkiness/savoury notes certainly add a unique aspect to this drink. At the price point it’s never a bad option and it’s great on tap. Glad I could revisit this as I begin to drink craft again, always good to go back to the basics/classics so you can remember the benchmarks for each style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The best Czech pilsner I've had. first time drinking this. Classic nose with the spice, hops, funk and skunk. Taste follows the nose. Very flavorful. Can't believe it's only 4.4%. Extremely well balanced. The perfect session beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased as a single bottle from The Fresh Market for $1.78. Poured into a pils glass.\n\nL - Clear goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head, and with lots of bubbles streaming up. Very good lacing.\nS - Floral. Biscuit. White bread. Not too much else, but it's nice.\nT - Wow! Starts off simple; floral and grassy. Evolves into a more chewy bread note, then into a bitter hop bite. Nice and bittersweet at first, and finishes bitter.\nF - Crisp. Clean. Easy-to-drink. Not filling in the slightest.\nO - The de-facto pilsner. Well-balanced, complex enough, and rounded. Though it's not the best, it sets the bar for what a pilsner should be! I definitely recommend it, but don't kill yourself looking for it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's good! But a bit overrated. It's a nice pilsner which is easy to drink and fairly balanced, the little bit of sweetness weights up the bitterness from the hops in a good way without becoming too sweet. Has a nice carbonation, served here in a 50 cl can. \n\nBut it is something out of the ordinary? Nah, not really. It's good, but it's not something you go &quot;woooow&quot; over. \nPerfect beer though if you want an easy-going ice cold beer to relax with in the summer or together with a bite to eat, imo.\n\nI buy it from time to time, which means I like it enough to come back to it. So I say try it, especially if you like stanard lagers/pilsners. There are a lot of worse lagers out there for sure.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A pilsener as good as pilseners get. Rerate: Had it from can this time, still the benchmark of a good pilsener. Only 4,4% now, but I remember (I think!) that the alcohol content was about 5,2% when I first had it (in Germany) many years ago?!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pilsner is not my jam. Strangely I love every other type of lager, but the hop variety and peppery notes of the style don't work for me. Trying to be objective here, but I did not enjoy this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amber to gold look with a white foam head that recedes to nothing. Smells like hops, bread, other non-sweet baked goods, and yes weed.\nThis has a lighter flavor but being a European Pilsner it has that different thing. It has a overt hoppy taste that sticks out. You can taste every single ingredient used in this. Has a slightly citrus flavor in it. It has a thin feel in your mouth. There is a slight bitterness that hit the side of your mouth and the back of your tongue. Kinda of a slight skunky flavor with it, but that comes with the hops used. Bready flavor. \nNot as good as I hoped for to be honest",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My personal #1",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Just a fantastic pilsner, best i’ve had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I first had this beer in the late eighties and loved it Been looking for a beer that is lower in alcohol, tried session IPAs, eh but &quot;rediscovered&quot; this lager. Great mouth feel, malty with nice hop flavor and aroma. Wonderful stuff. not sure why it took so long to find it again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I can’t believe I hadn’t reviewed this one sooner. I decided to make this my beer to break the fast that I was on during “Dry January.” And what a fantastic beer it is. \n\nPours a tan golden color, with light foaming. Amazing clarity. The aroma is lightly grassy, with just a faint floral hint—maybe a whisper of a whisper of vanilla, even? It’s wonderfully nuanced, and followed by the sip. Sweetish on the end, with a slight bitter punch. \n\nA classic, worthy of its reputation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 33cL bottle into a standard pint glass.\n\nFine white 1 finger head and lively carbonation. Head doesnt seem to be dissipating much really and if it is it's going slow. Golden straw color, with no haze. Decent lacing on it.\n\nSmell has a bit of fermentation a bit tart smelling. Could be old, a bit of skunk on it, bit not too intense. Not a lot of malt coming through. Smell kind of disappointed me.\n\nTaste has a decent layer of malt followed by another decent amount of hop bitterness. That fermentation funk followed a bit into the flavor. Again, seems like it could be an old bottle. Could be more crisp. At least its solidly drinkable and relatively clean. Solid pale lager just wish it was newer.\n\nFeel is smooth drinkable and refreshing. A nice summer beer not too heavy but not necessarily watery. Pretty standard.\n\nOverall not worthy of the legendary status it has from being the first pilsner. It's another beer. Tastes like many others. Better than a lot of others but still pretty middle of the road. Still definitely a pils.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The original Pilsner. Crisp on the palate with a perfect balance of malt and hops such that bitterness and sweetness combine seamlessly. Light body but still retains that exquisite distinct flavor. Perfectly frothy carbonation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I am probably just not a Pilsner fan. I think Budweiser tastes better. Still, had to give this one a go as I do like lagers. I will not buy it again. Just too bitter. And IPAs are too heavy and sweet. I am kind of lost right now re finding a beer I really like. \n\nThis beer does get better with each sip though. Maybe it will grow on me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev In Jan Svankmajer's perfect 1994 film FAUST, there is a scene in a Prague beer garden where our damned hero is treated to earthly delights such as a soft boiled egg with a mysterious key inside it, and a table which after he drills a hole into the top with a provided hand tool, spouts a fountain of delicious red wine. Nearby, an old man fights off a snarling black dog for a human leg wrapped in plastic. Two Satanic minders conduct the fraudulent debauche in the form of (not)blind accordion busker, and a kindly maitre d providing everything to Dr Faustus, gratis of course. A group of common laborers playing cards at another table stare in amazement at the supernatural proceedings. The beer they are drinking, from heavy glass mugs, is Pilsner Urquell.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev No other Pils compares. The uniqueness of the Czech ingredients and 'original' Pils process must be the secret to this beer. Even at 4.4% this pairs well with casual fair, and complex flavor alike. Appearance shows great carbonation and lacing, but fades to nil. \nSmell and flavor is world class; spice, hop, light malt and a crisp mouthfeel. \nHighly recommend a tall boy into a proper chalice.\nDon't be stupid, drink this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev In my never-ending quest to review and rate more lagers, pilsners and other 'everyday' beers, Pilsner Urquell, &quot;the original&quot; itself, has now been treated to my expert hand at critique. I find this beer most unique, even in the category of 'Bohemian Pilsners' where it is placed. From the deep golden color to the gentle spiciness in the taste, including a very 'tight' aftertaste, it certainly occupies a singular spot in the beer universe. I've had it on draught, I've had it in the 11.5 oz bottle but to my tastes, it really shines in the 16.9 ounce can (especially in those cool retro-design ones with the peculiar vintage graphics). One of the better pilsners/lagers that pair well with a good meal as well, so there's a bonus. Recommended!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours rich golden color with a lovely white head. Malty, bready with a hint of lemon peel. The hops add bitterness and tie the sweetness together. Enjoy this beer for what it is, a fine Pilsner.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Unique Pilsner aroma and flavor. A different malt and hop scent and taste. A flowered aura. This style is utilized from Hungary to France, it is very European, historical, smooth but not what Americans are used to. The price is great and well worth it. A great beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2 oz. chilled bottle poured into a chilled mug. Mar 10 22 is printed on label. Wife bought me a six pack to try because she's awesome.\n\nL: Pale yellow with a thick white foam that dissipates quickly after pouring. Moderate amount of visible bubbling. 4.0\n\nS: A mild smell of malt. Not much there. 3.25\n\nT: Moderate amount of bitterness from hops in aftertaste. Not bad. 3.75\n\nF: Relatively easy to drink, pleasing. Carbonation is just right. 4.0\n\nO: Not a new favorite, but worth buying again on a whim. 3.75",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev After more than a decade, finally getting around to reviewing this one. Purchased in a 16 oz. can from John's Marketplace SW PDX. \n\nLook: It's kind of straw-like in appearance. Almost see-through. Reminds me of a sunny San Diego day without any marine layer. \n\nSmell is a mix of citrus (grapefruit) and piney resins. A bit of malt, the tiniest bit, is also there. \n\nTaste: Bitter hops and added citrus bitter/sweetness. Some piney notes as well. There is malt to fill out the flavor. \n\nFeel: Comparatively thin in the mouth. Not bad, but the malt backbone that I really like in my substantial brews isn't terribly notable. \n\nOverall: I'd drink this almost any time. There are definitely more developed IPAs and double IPAs out there these days, but this is a classic that's still eminently enjoyable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight up west coast classic.\nClear golden with a white soapy head, citrus pith on the nose, great clean piney flavor all wrapped up in a wonderfully crisp package. Excellent stuff and a standard bearer for the style",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a rich golden color with about a finger of head. You can smell the wonderful, herbal hops and some malt as well. The taste is, well, glorious: bitter herbal hops, citrus, some malt, dry and crisp. If you don’t like this you don’t like IPA’s. Pretty much perfect in all aspects and I’ll continue to buy when my bottle shop gets them in, cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 650 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.25%. Golden colour, only slightly hazy. Large white head. Pleasant hoppy aroma, notes of pine, caramel and grapefruit. Lovely and well balanced hoppy flavour, pine needles and grapefruit again, not extreme - just very well made.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Let it begin with a pint can poured into a clear glass liter mug. Now, there's something to look at. The ale is a cloudy but bright amber with a bit of white head and lacing. It smells like hops and some more hops and not much more. The taste is dry and hoppy, but not overly bitter. The balance with a malt backbone missing in the aroma, is there for the mouth and provides a wonderful taste and mouthfeel sensation. A remarkably good IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear, but somewhat oily golden color. Thick 3 - 4 finger head collapses leaving just about. 1/2 inch layer of velvety foam on top of the beer. Beautiful lacing is left on the glass as its consumed. \n\nThe aroma is not as &quot;massive and bursting&quot; as the can would imply - rather I get some mild, even somewhat muted notes of pine, pine needles, grapefruit, and a touch of tangerine. Really hits that hallmark of the WCIPA in that its incredibly hop forward on the aroma. \n\nTaste follows the nose with notes of pine, dried pine needles, sap, with almost a woody quality to it. Lighter notes of tangerine, grapefruit and citrus rind do come through, but with great deference to the pine notes. Almost no malt character to this one at all. There is a slight sweetness to this, reminiscent of a candied orange rind. \n\nFeel is light, slick and a tad bit oily. Bright prickly carbonation frames the mouthfeel. Somewhat drier on the finish. \n\nOverall, this is a really nice WCIPA. I would definitely drink this one again if it keeps showing up in IL fresh.",

Crisp and crushable as a lager, full and complex as an IPA. Taste-wise somewhere in between West Coast and East Coast with a superb mouthfeel. Probably the most beautiful head I‘ve seen on any beer poured from a can. Overall even better than Heady Topper. A beer you could drink all day every day.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Hazy, straw - gold, white head, mango, pineapple smell. Cracker malt, strong bitterness, a fun NEIPA with lots of bitterness. Is this a west coast NEIPA?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I drink this beer a lot and it is without a doubt perfection in a can. Nice grapefruity flavor and not at all boozy But you must drink it fresh - even 2 weeks old it starts to lose something.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 11/30/2021, so not the freshest, but...\n\nL: Hazy but not opaque, straw-colored to golden. Half-inch head that lingers for a long time.\nS: Dank and resiny at first; citrus and melon notes come to the fore as it warms up.\nT: Inverse of the nose -- the orange peel bitterness at the front, pine and resin (VERY dank, I think more so than Heady) at the back.\nF: Very drinkable, smooth and light.\nO: It seems barely a hot take anymore to say that I prefer it to Heady Topper. It still has the same sticky pine tree aesthetic but it's more session-y. Glad this hit western PA, hope the Alchemist sends it back home to Pittsburgh more regularly.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a Tree House teku glass. Canned on 11/30/21, making this exactly a month old.\n\nA: Pours pretty hazy, but not quite murky. Egg-shell white head that lingers to about a half-finger.\n\nS: Big fruit notes up first, with papaya, peach and mango. Then a little bit of a piney-dank note near the back. \n\nT: Fruits up front again, stone-fruit, mango, a touch of pineapple. Mid and finish is all dank bitterness, some pine, resiny. A little earthy, grassy note on the finish too.\n\nM: Surprisingly bitter, now I see why they don't try call this a NE-style IPA. It's a nice, full body, very creamy. Not boozy at all. But ya, very dank on the finish.\n\nO: Huge shout out to SadMachine for hooking me up with this. Huge want for me for a long time ever since I first had Heady Topper. I actually made it to Vermont in December 2013, and I'm pretty sure they started canning this early 2014. So just missed it. But, alas! Haven't had Heady in a while, but I plan to revisit it soon. This is way hoppier and bitter than I'd imagined it to be. Not a true NE-style IPA at all. But it's still very drinkable. Very smooth, nice fruity notes, the hops are not overpowering and remind you what a nice, balanced IPA should taste like. Drinking this really does remind me of the peak of the hoppy IPA just before the haze craze took off. Really nice beer here, and a true work of art from The Alchemist.\n\nRecommendation: Still one of the greats after all these years, a must-try in my book. If you haven't had it yet, don't give up!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pretty on par with heady topper smooth herbal bitterness sticking sweet dank goodness balance at max peak! The hate I don't understand its a great IPA especially when you can pick it up with less than two weeks of age you peasants! \n\nOverall a more drinkable version of Heady topper than I wish I could find more often!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Woodstock Vermont with Rachel and dawn. Fall 2019. 4 pack cans from local market.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev can then glass\nBought at the brewery. Canned, two days prior. \nAs many aficionados know, The Alchemist is adamant about drinking their beers, straight out of the can. I obeyed the edict, and tasted this beer first, out of the can. Did pour half a glass out first to be able to rate the look. As for the smell, did try to do so, at the can, not nearly as much as a glass, so the smell rating came, via the glass as well. On to the taste, tried a few sips from the can, then the glass, again, more from the glass. Used mainly the glass to rate the taste and the rest, as well.\nQuickly dissipating, frothy, white head. Milky, light orange and gold look. Bright, mix of tropical fruit, such as passion fruit, guava, a bit of tangerine peel and a bit of light toasted malt, to the smell. Big citrus peel bite, with a little fruity, spiced malt, in the mix. Citrus peel bite to the finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L - hazy orange pour with 2-finger white head. Nice lacing throughout.\nS - strong citrus aroma. More grapefruit than others (orange, etc.).\nT - follows nose, juicy, bitter.\nF - medium mouthfeel, fairly smooth, dry finish.\nO - drinks more like a DIPA to me, but still very good. Yum!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy color of grapefruit juice with a finger of head. The nose has bright notes of citrus, particularly grapefruits. The flavor is has a solid hop resin quality coupled with modest sweet citrus notes. The body is spot-on - maybe even a bit hearty for the style. \n\nThis offering drinks like a much bigger DIPA. It is a really nice blend between the new-kid juicy IPAs and old school bitter West Coast IPA style.\n\nShockingly, I am going to go on record saying that I like it more than Heady!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle.\n\nOn the pour it's dark but not black indoor lighting reveals a dark brown that let's a small amount of light through, held up to light it's a dark reddish brown with no haze. Less than one finger head that dissipates immediately to a ring around the glass.\n\nAroma is definitely influenced by licorice but very subtly and it blends into the dark malt sweetness quite well. The new Belgium website says there is in fact some nugget hops but they aren't very present in the aroma. Beyond the licorice it's similar to a belgian trippel/Dunkel in aroma if you were to combine the two traditional styles.\n\nTaste is quite dry and yeasty but with some chocolate roasty malt notes. Some herbal bitterness but this beer is quite easy to drink and not the heaviest in flavor. I'd say this is pretty similar to the Baltic porter style. Lagery porter like beer but they don't call it either of those things. Some bitterness does creep up as you drink, dissimilar to hops, that seem to get less bitter as you drink. Definitely a dark malty beer\n\nFeel is creamy but drinkable. Similar to a Baltic porter once again. Not light but not too heavy either. Big beer relative to a lot of what's out there but smaller than the trippel by these guys.\n\nOverall an interesting beer that's not super traditional to any style it seems other than dark lager inspired by a mideavil beer recipe. It's good, not necessarily something that's sticking out to me though.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very crisp and light. Initial taste borders on sweet with bitter aftertaste. But that's good! Carbonation is disappointing but overall excellent dark brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great appearance\nCaramel and malt flavor with chocolate \nMouthfeel was nothing like I expected, instead it was very drinkable and crisp for such a dark lager\nLight finish that leaves you wanting more",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I actually like this a good bit based on one bottle, body is good even with no glass and out of the bottle, does have lager vibes but it seems like it needs to be a smidge warmer like other dark brews to be enjoyed. Relatively impressed and glad cuz for some reason I don't have a great liking for a lot of their beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (12 oz bottle, 68799 06MAR22; purchased single off shelf at Total Wine, Tucson... poured into a stemless wine glass)\n\nL: clear, ruby-garnet liquid; fleeting, flimsy, tanned khaki-colored foam... about what one would expect from a non-bottle condition rendering of this derivative style... keeps a thin yet tight collar; little lacing\n\nS: old upholstery, dry port, desiccating plum, hint of red cough medicine... overall weak(ened) intensity but inviting expression\n\nT: up front: curiously roasty, oxidized dark sherry overtones; bit of a prune color to its dry aftertaste.... second sip reveals more depth: fruitcake, berry jelly, hints of toasty dark crystal malt... ehhh, I could see a justifiable (doppel)bock comparison... overall: dry, malty, mulled wine\n\nF: velvety carbonation softening the edges of its whispery-plush body; calm caress of residual warmth... maybe this is a lager... too suave\n\nO: low-key high quality, but I'll take Ommegang Abbey Ale any day over this... this was the last of 4 consecutive reviews this morning of brands I can't readily procure out east... I love the 'Euro dark lager' label for this, because it's sort of appropriate, despite this being an undeniably familiar relic of early craft beer Dubbel knock-offs... as a 'lager', it's great, but c'mon, don't corrupt my to-style ratings bro; their zwert story is romantically compelling but bs - doesn't result in a distinctive brew... arguably slightly higher marks than it deserves (bland, rough edges), but I'd have this again (1849)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Dark brown to black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light with a short-lasting head that settles to a film and leaves good lacing behind\nAroma: Warm brown bread, light chocolate notes, wafts of licorice, a little toffee, and mild earthy notes\nTaste: Rich bready malt, toffee, and chocolate are the initial notes and after they settle, some nice light licorice appears along with some earthiness. The flavors all meld well before brown bread and chocolate take hold and close it out\nMouthfeel: Full but light, very clean, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and clean finish\nOverall: I dig it. I love these folks’ Belgian offerings so scoring this as part of their mix 12-pack was a fun and tasty chance to revisit. The licorice notes make it unique tasting and smelling and they work well here in my opinion plus help set this apart from other Euro Dark Lagers (which although this is an ale, feels/tastes like a lager). Unique, well-made, and tasty",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a tall clear pint glass. The appearance of the beer resembles a sort of cola/mahogany color, with more than a finger's worth of fluffy tan head with good retention and lacing.\n\nAroma: very malty, and rich notes of coffee and chocolate/cocoa. Other notes of toffee, subtle vanilla, licorice, spices, cherries, raisins, bread crust, yeast, and cinnamon.\n\nReally tasting dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee on the palette, along with the spices, licorice, and subtle vanilla most especially. Essentially follows the aroma. Body is medium-light.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance is black, not quite pitch black; ruby red/dark brown highlights. The tan head is absurdly creamy and thick for what appeared to be low carbonation initially. Long-lasting retention and sheets of lacing.\n\nOn the nose I get lots of chocolate, a little bit of coffee and vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon or some vague spice note.\n\nChocolate dominates the palate, hitting upfront with hints of vanilla, dark brown bread in the middle, a touch of plum and balsamic vinegar, and maybe just a vague hint of generic spice. Finishes quick dry with a dusting more of cocoa powder, before finishing more abruptly than expected into cleanness.\n\nThe mouthfeel is medium, moderately carbonated, well carbonated and slightly pillow. Finishes crisper and lighter than expected, given the chewiness of the mid-palate.\n\n...Overall, well a solid beer. I had to know idea what style of this beer was going in. I thought it was a Belgian dark ale and reviewed it as such! Surprise, surprise...well, it's pretty solid for a Euro black lager!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very scrappy notes from 2010. 6 pack from Surdyk's in NE Minneapolis.\n12 ounce bottles. Poured into a pint glass.\nLooks like a nice medium dark lager and has an 'old world' aroma. Smooth, creamy and dry with medium carbonation. Sweet chocolate and fairly malty. Very good tasting beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The beer pours dark brown with a creamy tan head. The head has real staying power!!!! Nice lacing. Aroma of chocolate, cherry, malt, and hint of banana. Taste is dark chocolate, cream, and picking up that slight hint of banana again. The mouthfeel is one of the best I have had. The bear is creamy and soft, almost the consistency of a melted milkshake. This is an outstanding beer! Nice job New Belgium!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Purchased as a 12-bottle variety pack from Sam's Club for $15.90. Poured into a nonic pint glass.\n\nL - Dark, molasses brown with a barely one-finger coffee brown head. Laces well.\nS - Raisin, cacao, and dark breads. Slight ethanol.\nT - Dark chocolate and stone fruit, washed over by pumpernickel and caramel. Light licorice and toffee finish. Not bitter in the slightest.\nF - Sticky. Silky. Full-bodied, with light carbonation. Definitely on the heavier side.\nO - A fantastic beer on its own, but even better when paired with steak! Great for a colder night. Couldn't drink more than one in one sitting, I'm afraid. Would highly recommend trying at least once. Will purchase again if I see it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This was surprisingly tasty... This came in a New Belgium variety pack... It's on the thin side, which I actually prefer in a darker beer... Nice nose and easy to drink.... Taste good too",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Three fingers of creme brulee-colored foam topped translucent coffee on the pour, and it hung around for a while. Faint but noticeable scent of the cake part of fruitcake (the good kind). However, the taste hinted at vanilla and an astringent fruit, sweet at first and a slight bitterness and carbonation on the finish. The more I drink, the more citrus I pick up.... not an unpleasant amount but also reminiscent of the dried citrus peel in some fruitcakes (yeah, I decided not to start one this year but I can still think about it). I'm not sure that I've had a Euro-style dark lager before, but it feels about right... less satiny than a stout but more substantial than a regular lager. It's going well with pizza on crisp, wet evening so I'll likely give it another try in the future.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Nice mahogany pour. Thin off-white head that quickly melts to ring around the sides with wispy clouds in the center. Good foamy lace as the beer goes down.\nSmell and Taste: Somewhat dry for a European Dark beer. Faint licorice that I've never been a fan of.\nFeel: Slightly harsh and seltzer like.\nOverall: Not what I was expecting. Little bit weak on the malts in my opinion for this style of beer. I'll be moving on.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz. bottle poured into Imperial Pint glass\nLook: Three finger, creamy head. Dark color, like black coffee, excellent lacing\nSmell: Malty, like a crusty bread, hints of chocolate\nTaste: Definitely malty, with medium bitterness. There are notes of dark chocolate, dry finish\nFeel: Excellent mouthfeel, carbonation is there but not overdone, feels lighter than expected\nOverall: This is an excellent dark beer. If this is typical of the style I will have to drink more.\nPair with spicy meats, wild game, German sausage, BBQ. Bitterness is mild enough you could mix with a high percentage chocolate to intensify the chocolates in beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours almost black with a nice tan head and decent lacing.\n\nTastes of roasted malt with a light biscuity/cracker like note and mild dark chocolate with just enough bitterness to settle it. A lighter style of beer. Nice.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Overall good, but fairly 1-dimensional. A good hint of chocolate and earthy licorice, but it still retains some lightness. A nice cross between a more refreshing feel and darker flavors.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Unknown age bottle into a pint glass. Dark mahogany red color, clear and crisp, really nice multi layer head with a fine smooth cap and rich hearty bubbles retained in a 1 finger head 10 minutes after the pour. Really nice nose here, rich sweet chocolate malt, lager yeast, pecan pie, and cinnamon. The taste is all caramel, chocolate, mulling spice, and finishing on a sweet cacao note that lingers on the palate with a touch of lager grass. The mouthfeel is a touch thin, but it is crisp and clean like a lager should be.\n\nI have had better dark lager but it is a hard style to get right, and this is a great, albeit a touch sweet, attempt."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A solid starter IPA of the traditional back in the day variety, I drank a ton of it for a while - similar to, but inferior to in every aspect the great SNPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pours a slightly hazed gold body with a billowing white frothy foam head that has moderate retention and leaves a ton of thin sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy froth cap with defined halo \n\naroma is sweet and grainy, malt forward with floral and slightly piney hops on the wings\n\ntaste is sweet and juicy, with a floral flair up front that fades to an earthy light bitterness tinged with pine with the finish\n\nmouthfeel in fairly thin bodied with high carbonation, running slightly watery and grainy with a pillowed, juicy edge before finishing mildly dry and leaving a slightly sweet herbal aftertaste tinged with earthy bitterness\n\noverall:\nsolid session IPA that runs mostly sweet and juicy but manages a solid balance thanks to a cascade hop bittersweetness. \nwouldn't consider it one of the greats, but it's in the top 15 for me as far as highbrow craft IPA flagships.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not one of the better ones I have had from Harpoon, but still solid enough to enjoy. Comparatively speaking, it's not as sweet smelling or juicy as others, but the mouthfeel was full-bodied which made up for a less than favorable taste. Again, when you take it all in, it's solid. Just not necessarily memorable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look...darker brown copper with a white head and ample carbonation . The way IPAs used to look\nSmell...faint smell of hops as the usual like many of the old school favorites. \nTaste...Exquisite apricot, malt bitter with a very full body for the ABV. Back to the taste, apricot leaving to a finish dryness \nFeel...A n ample carbonation that makes the consistency a little sticky and resinous. A great quality to this beer.\nOverall...My belief is slanted such as this beer was a staple for a long time. This was my requested wedding beer that had to be there!! Anyways this beer was a very good one and still everyone should try. This beer was definitely a trail blazer out east.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Scrappy notes from 2010. \n6 pack of 12 ounce bottles purchased chilled.\nThis is probably the lightest tasting and lightest drinking IPA that I've had to date. It has a beautiful copper color with a nice white head. The nose is pretty full with hops that are flowery and some malt. The taste is mainly hoppy and is a bit thin or watery but tasty nonetheless. It has a nice light bitterness to it and drinks easy and fast. Not too shabby.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The claim is &quot;New England's First IPA&quot; and that may be. Most beer historians credit Ballantine as being the first to brew one in the U.S., but that was in New York. Enough history, let's empty a twelve ounce can into a clear Imperial pint glass and review it. First, it's a lovely bright copper-amber with a sparse, but enduring white head. There's plenty of malt to be had by the nose. The taste is sharply hoppy, with the malt failing to keep up. The hops are boldly bitter, earthy, yet finishing dryly. This is a good bitterly hopped AIPA, lacking only a little malty counterbalance. It may not offer enough complexity for some, but this is a spot on traditional IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 19.2oz can, dated 04/05/21. Served in a willi becher.\n\nPours a crystal clear copper-gold with two fingers of dense, foam insulation-like head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, creamy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing. Honestly, I wasn’t prepared for it to look this good.\n\nNose is sharp, grainy and vaguely cider-like. Crackers and apple skins.\n\nTaste is dry like soda crackers, crisp and biting. Apple skin, orange oil, turpentine. \n\nFeel is crisp and clean, drying, medium bodied with brisk carbonation.\n\nThere was a time I drank quite a lot of this and I guess I wasn’t as stupid as I remember myself being because this is mighty tasty. The fact that it’s only a month old may have something to do with it. At any rate, the can label promises ‘hoppy, balanced, crisp’ and fucked if it isn’t all of those things.\n\n(Replaces a 3.48 rating-without-review dated 05/17/15).",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Overall this beer is just a snooze fest. Its a cheap beer and i get that, but this is not a good beer. There is nothing overly offensive about this beer but it just taste like water. Not what i expected for and i feel at this price, there are better options that will make you much more happy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nicedarker amber color easy drinking gives a good buzz not a bad beer low hop taste",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sometimes you just need a break from the hazy IPAs that occupy every store and every corner of the refrigerator. And sometimes you don’t even want an IPA. This Pale Ale takes me back to some of my first craft beers, before IBUs started hitting sky high. And because of that it is like so many other pale ales, clear and clean, with a nice squeeze of hops and a refreshing palate that would be very difficult to replicate in a higher gravity style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a really nice, balanced IPA. It has a very clear, rich, honey color. The taste is a little bitter with bright citrus notes. It's pretty easy drinking, full feeling, and goes well with rich or spicy foods.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a can.\n\nPours a golden, copper in color with a thin layer of head. Not much lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks spot on. Aroma is very floral with some herbal spiciness, bubblegum and a toasty, biscuity malt backbone. Taste follows the nose surprisingly well. Spicy, earthy, floral hops with some lemon, grapefruit and pine balanced out by a toasty, biscuit malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium with subdued but lively carbonation and a little bit of chewiness. Pretty drinkable. Overall a solid offering that is balanced and offers some complexity, but it's a bit too spicy/piney for my preference. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from 12 oz bottle, bottled on date: 01/06/2020. Nice golden color with a dissipating white head\nMalty on the nose, like toasted nuts and slight floral hops and hint of pine\nTaste is hop forward, citrus to the back and hint of floral, distinct malt, but on the bready, biscuity side \nFeel is medium bodied, but a bit too over carbonated \nThe first time I tasted this ale was at the end of 1997 and it was on draught at Christopher's in Cambridge and it was fantastic. It has lost that wonderful floral, malt smooth balance it had back then. But still a pretty good ale for the money (usually the lower priced option of the choices)\nEdit: I have since read some other reviews and one or two have dissed the beer according to where they bought it on draught. Beware. There is a big variation in how this is kept in bars and restaurants. I recommend trying it local to Harpoon, Boston and in a place that looks after their beers, such as the brewery itself, of course",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A classic on the Boston beer circuit since the mid 80’s and one that I consistently find myself ordering at restaurants and bars. A very reliably west cost style IPA that that tantalizes your tastebuds with crisped malty goodness. For those of us at 1009, this is the standard for the style that all others are compared to. For the love of beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sharp, hoppy and bright - wonderful strength (caught me out first time I drank it).Alays consistent and on draft was a perfect beer. Loved this beer when living in Boston MA a few years ago - converted me to Cask IPA forever. It was briefly available through Adnams here in the UK but that was short lived. Is it available at all anywhere in the UK? USA IPa's are huge now over here and this would be a huge success if it was widely available.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a translucent honey color with a decent foamy white head. Smell malty bread (pumpernickel) subtle hints of fresh hops. Taste is very pleasant,nice bitter hop bite with a suitable malt backbone. Feels crisp,bitter,ample carbonation. Overall a fine example of an English IPA. I have noticed this style gets little respect with scores,I think American fruit hop bombs make this seem &quot;mild&quot; and people don't rate according to the style. Why are Pilsners low and stouts High? The finest examples of Pilsners usually never hit 90, yet a mediocre stout will get a 92."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This was deeply appealing by description. Not sure if it was the yeast or (maybe) bad bottle, but the stuff was kind of bitter and frankly a bit nasty. Scoring more objectively with benefit of the doubt.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. ABV is 8%. Amber to copper colour, low head. Boring aroma, slightly malty. Malty flavour, notes of caramel, hints of cinnamon.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 32oz crowler purchased two days ago at J's Liquor Owensboro poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. Numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. Head is a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. Overall, heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Why is this no longer available in Georgia. When craft beer and microbreweries first started to get popular in the metro Atlanta region back in the early 2000s, this was one of the very first beers that I saw from the movement. Certainly without a doubt the first Dogfish Head I ever saw. I haven't seen it 'round these parts in probably 13-14 years. Too bad becauise this is a really good one and I wish I could have one right now",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've had this. It makes me think of Shawn Gallagher's wedding. I went to visit Shawn and we stopped at Dogfish Brewery. Ah bliss, I was like a kid in a candy store. I have fond memories of Dogfish as it was the New Yorker article about Dogfish that got me into beer! As you can tell I am an Intellectual Aesthete",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle. \n\nClear brown/red hue. \n\nOff-white head; nice lacing. \n\nCream soda, caramelized sugar &amp; sweet malt nose. Unique. \n\nMedium thick mouthfeel. \n\nCream, caramelized sugar; sweet but not cloying. A unique, enjoyable beer; one is enough per session.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 8/10/12: Pours an almost clear reddish brown producing 3 fingers of tan, rapidly diminishing heat that leaves a dense and lasting surface cap but minimal lace. Aroma is sweet malty caramel, vanilla, hints of dark fruit, molasses with a small but detectable hop presence. Taste is less sweet than the promise of the nose: dark malt, fruity fruitcake, molasses and alcohol. Dry, peppery, lightly bitter and boozy in the finish and aftertaste."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz can (“PKGD 01/10/22”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Hazy amber gold with a thick, rocky head of white foam and streaky lace. Layered aromas of orange citrus, pine, stone and tropical fruit. More fruit follows in the taste with orange citrus, melon and tropical fruit, slight rye spice, pine resin and dank notes. Finishes crisp, bitter and dry. Medium body, smooth feel and moderate carbonation. Densely flavorful with plenty of unique hop character.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (100%), pale yellow color with a large, white head. SRM of 6. One of the haziest and most opaque beers I have seen. (4.50)\n\nAroma: Absolutely giant aromas of mandarin orange, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, citrus, and more tropical fruit. Green Cantaloupe Melon. Even some cinnamon spice. A bit of herbal qualities underneath. Extremely juicy and green. Huge green citrus and tropical banana.\n\nFlavor: A giant bomb of biting mandarin orange citrus, marmalade, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, green mango, gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon altogether. Extremely green and juicy citrus with pine underneath. Finishes sweet and juicy. The green fruit is showcased here mostly in a Citra format, however some gooseberry and grape underneath, but less than I expected. \n\nFeel: Medium-bodied. Sweet and biting. Leaves a green juiciness on the palate that is palate-wrecking.\n\nCompared to Lagunitas Stereohopsis Volume 1, 1/3/21: Pours a lighter and much hazier color. Stronger and juicier aromas. Much more fruity and hazier. The Nelson evolves into more of a green citrus rather than green orchard fruit. More citrus, less orchard-fruit. Overall, quite a similar flavor from the Nelson which is interesting. Finishes much juicier, sweeter, but possibly a lighter body.\n\nCompared to Toppling Goliath Pseudo Sue 1/2/22: Pours slightly hazier. Milder aromas. More mandarin orange, marmalade, and cantaloupe. Less lemon citrus and citrus flower. \n\nCompared to Surly's Axe Man IPA 2/6/22: Pours a lighter and hazier color. Milder aromas. More gooseberry, grape, and deep and resinous tropical and berry notes. Less citrus peel, pineapple, pine, flower, and flavor complexity. \n\nCompared to Stone Deliciousness IPA 3/4/22: Pours a hazier and lighter color. Stronger aromas. More grapefruit, sweet lemon, yellow, and green plastic flavors. Less grapefruit citrus, tangerine, and pine. Slightly less bitter. More grape flavor\n\nOverall: What a giant and juicy IPA. Fantastic mandarin orange, pulp, green gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon flavors. Even some slight cinnamon spice. You could brush your teeth with this beer. Palate cleansing and green. The Nelson doesn't provide the green grape/gooseberry/orchardfruit I was expecting and leans more citrus. Almost like the Citra hop. Actually tastes quite similar to Toppling Goliath's PseudoSue. Would be worth a comparison to PseudoSue, Axe Man, or KIng Sue if I manage to pick this one up again. So dense, so juicy, and so good. (Final Rating: 4.48)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy orange into a paper hotel coffee cup with a big 3&quot; head, excellent retention and lacing despite the vessel. Nose is tropical juice at first before turning into floral honey and pine as it warms; a hint of malt, grain, and maybe some diesel (though might be the cup). Taste is nicely balanced between sweet, juicer hop elements and a lingering bitterness on the finish. Super smooth on the palate with no hint of alcohol. Glad to finally give it a try.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 3/10/21. Consumed from a tulip glass 8/6/21. I would have liked to have tried a fresher version, but smell and taste were both examples of the Nelson hop. Disappointing Look: very small head that was very short lived and there were solids in the beer. It was hazier than I expected. Quite hoppy. My ratings here are somewhat generous and take into account the possible effect of canning date vs. consumption date. With all the great IPAs out there I did not feel that this was a stellar example worth repeating. I was very surprised to see a 98 pt rating.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It smells like fresh pine and a little dank. Then the more I smell it i get some breadwater sweetness but the piny hops are the predominant scent.\n\nOh yeah, now I get the hype. The taste is so clean. First it's barely sweet with a hint of pine and then it's a really bright piny hoppiness.\n\nIt's not quite as thin as most IPAs with a medium body.  The finish is bitter and then dank. It lasts for a long time.\n\nOverall it is one of the better IPAs I've had.  It's smooth, balanced and incredibly refreshing. I give this one a really great 5.7 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look is opaque orange and more hazy than you would think. Nice one finger of white head with decent retention. Smell is white white and cedar with notes of tropical fruits. Taste is white whine with grape notes. I always seem to get a wood/Cedar flavor from the Nelson Sauvignon hops. Not hating it at all. Feels soft and approachable, easy to drink. This beer is outstanding and worth its reputation",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12oz can dated 3/9/21 into a weizen glass.\n\nPours an opaque orangish yellow with about two and a half fingers of white head. Excellent retention and lacing.\n\nSmells of oranges, faint grapes, pineapple and pine.\n\nTaste...Getting a white wine vibe along with slight citrus acidity (not off-putting). Oranges and grapefruit in the background.\n\nSoft, smooth mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste.\n\nOverall, a really decent beer with an interesting taste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It pours a golden straw color with a nice sized head. \nThere are aromas of rye and tropical fruit. \nI’m not usually a fan of Rye IPAs. But this one is very nice The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor.\nIt has a nice body and mouthfeel. \nLeaves a nice aftertaste. The rye works well with the bitterness. \n\n\nOverall, this is an excellent ipa highlighted by the rye and tropical flavors with just enough bitterness for a good punch.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours well out of a can, head looks good, foam clings to glass, etc. Very hazy with some larger particulates floating around.\n\nWhite wine-like characteristics of the hop prominent in smell, along with some mango/tropical fruit.\n\nThe most prominent flavor is ripe mango both in flavor profile and sweetness. Not getting much else but mango is awesome so that's a plus.\n\nRobust feel but still dangerously smooth and easy to put down, even at 7%.\n\nWould buy on sight, wife--approved and she hates IPAs.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11/27/15:\nLightly hazy, bright golden appearance, with a large, voluminous, gorgeous cloud-white head, leaving lace and looking beautiful.\n\nIncredibly fresh and vibrant aromatics, but not with the usual pine and citrus notes we expect in an IPA. Rye malt comes across, subtly, and some white grape notes, some white wine character, and just a whiff of the ol' cat pee, the common traits of the Nelson Sauvin. Tropical fruit essence rolls up. Intriguing stuff.\n\nIn the mouth, it's all the hoppy goodness. Rye spiciness creeps up just a little, but the hops are tops here. Bold bitterness, with fruity notes abounding. Amazing beer. So full of flavor, big on the hops, and a delight to drink. Just about perfect. Mmmm.\n\nGreat beer, go drink it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Been around for a while. Still a classic"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is my first sample. I'm wary of stouts made with lactose, because while I have had a couple of good ones -- Espressway and Two Die 4 by Two Roads -- I've had sickeningly sweet examples such as Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing and Brig from Springdale.\n\nIn any event, this particular brew is black in color. It boasts a thick, lasting, tan head. The nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness, cream, and spice.\n\nIt is creamy and medium-bodied in feel. \n\nThe palate stuns me. Beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices. The spice component is perfect; it is not overdone. \n\nThe beer's high ABV is utterly hidden. \n\nI have nothing but praise for this stout. It is the best beer from Stone I've ever had. It is perfect.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12/25/21 Shared bottle @ Brian’s.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I've had this fresh and cellared.\n\nJet black body with a dark khaki head.\nPicking up cinnamon, coffee and dark chocolate.\nTaste fresh has chocolate, cinnamon, slight chili pepper and warm spices.\nTaste with a couple of years changed a little, more of a roasted coffee and chocolate and little to no chili peppers, but the cinnamon and cardamom spices are a little more prevalent.\nMouthfeel fresh and aged is full and satisfying. A decent lingering chocolate spice cake on the tongue.\nA really tasty beer fresh or with a little age on it. Actually I prefer it with a couple of years.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap at Cardinal Pub Bar, Stavanger: black colour, tan head. Aroma and flavour of roast malts, coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, lactose, chili peppers. Very good and unusual beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;look: 95% black\n\nsmell: light chocolate coffee\n\ntaste: roasted malt, the chocolate flavor is actually not that strong, and I can barely taste the pepper or cinnamon \n\nfeel: creamy and smooth, maybe a little too bitter tho\n\noverall: this is far away from treehouse milk stouts, it's overrated in my opinion",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Robust, Dark, and Bold with fine lacing. Distinct hints of cinnamon, peppers, spices, and chocolate, in both the nose and palate. It all finishes strongly and slowly.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cinnamon upfront followed by some spice from the peppers with a coffee finish. The more you drink the better it gets.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wait for this beer to come out every year. I liked the green package beer, better than the red packaging.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12oz can:\n\nAppearance: Black, huge head.\n\nSmell: Gingerbread/cinnamon, sweetness.\n\nTaste: Mild sweetness, cinnamon, slight hot pepper hit, reminds me of a gingerbread cookie with a spicy chaser.\n\nOverall: Nice holiday beer, ginger cookie flavor with some warming alcohol. I'll have to pick up some more for the coming cold months.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’m a big fan of winter stouts. Picked up a six pack at the local beer distributor. Pour very dark, nice aroma. Taste was different from other stouts I have had. Was skeptical at first. By the end of the six pack, I was a believer. Went back to pick up another six pack a week and a half later, gone.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pouring this nearly black can of awesomeness into a pint glass produced a 1&quot; tan head that had excellent retention and lacing. This beer looks just wonderful.\n\nAroma was complex. At cellar temperature: Mexican chocolate, peppers, vanilla, faint cinnamon. It was like smelling an aromatic puzzle where all the pieces fit together perfectly.\n\nTaste: Just wow. Taste follows the nose. This is just the right level of sweetness for a holiday stout. The peppers and cinnamon provide just a touch of lingering heat, and the chocolate gives you a bit of unsweetened bitterness. This is really a wonderful beer - strong competition for Prairie's Christmas Bomb.\n\nMouthfeel toes the line between medium and full bodied, which is a perfect compliment to the flavor profile. This is just thick enough for the big, bold flavors, but also incredibly smooth.\n\nOverall: I am filled with regret that I only bought a single. This will be a six pack next year. Just....wow.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. Canned on 9/16/20, so this exactly 3 months old. I only cooled this in the fridge for a short time, and I gave it some time to come closer to room temperature for a while before opening. Seems to be the right temperature - just cool but not cold. Could even probably drink this at cellar temperature and it would be good.\n\nLook: Pours almost pitch black with light brown highlights. Has a very nice looking fluffy brown head. The head dissipated slowly; a very thin head is lingering. Tiny bubbles are slowly rising to the surface.\n\nSmell: This has a very nice, complex aroma. The first things that I get are coffee, cocoa powder, fruity chili pepper, and roasty toasty malts. The back end has cinnamon and nutmeg. Hard to pick up the vanilla on the nose, but it could easily be blending in with the chocolate and other aromas. After drinking, I can pick up on a vanilla cream note in the nose on the front end that is reminiscent of cream soda, very nice. Gives some nutty roasted almond notes too that are quite nice. A mild earthy hop aroma and acidity on the finish as well. This smells like Mexican hot chocolate and it smells delicious!\n\nTaste: Wow, this is a lot sweeter than I expected. It at least has a perceived sweetness initially. It's very smooth and drinkable. This is a dangerous beer at 8.1% ABV. The flavors in this beer meld together very nicely; to me they are more discernible on the nose than in the mouth. Up front, you get spiced coffee/hot chocolate notes and sweetness that quickly transition to a roasty, slightly bitter finish with a lingering spicy chili pepper. The finish has really nice unsweetened chocolate notes, along with some fruitiness from the chocolate and pasilla pepper. The finish has a lot of sweetness also; you can tell your brain what you want to focus on - bitter or sweet. I get a lot of spiced nut notes on the finish as well.\n\nFeel: Mouthfeel is really nice - on the thicker side of medium body. Slightly chewy and pefectly carbonated for this type of beer.\n\nOverall: A really delicious adjunct stout. Is this a pastry stout? I have heard so much about pastry stouts, but I don't actually know how to characterize one and whether this is in or out. Regardless, it's a very delicious beer. With all the specialty ingredients that they put in, you sure hope that it would come out delicious but they could have easily messed up such a complicated recipe. Kudos to Stone for finding the right balance to express all of these flavors without overpowering the beer.\n\nNote: Lactose added.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a can. This pours a dark coffee cola color with heaping layers of creamy foam. Nice dusting of cinnamon on the nose, and what I think of an ancho chile note. Dry finish, with some cacao in the back, and more cinnamon.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not a whole lot to say that hasn't been said already. This beer looks, smells, and tastes fantastic. Make sure you let it warm up a bit so you can fully appreciate everything it brings to the table.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours very dark with a big foamy head that slowly fades. Big chocolate aroma mixes with pepper, smokey. Flavor is chocolate, coffee, some smoky pepper, vanilla, faint cinnamon. Light to medium bodied, has a bitter espresso finish. Overall a good stout, I would expect it to be thicker, richer, and creamier.\n\n11/7/20\n12 oz can dated 9/9/20\n4 rating",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I purchased a March 2018 bottle and consumed it 8 months past the best by date. Despite being supposedly old it was creamy, mellow and smooth. Not much pepper or heat.\n\nFast forward to 2020: I finally found this fresh, canned 5 weeks ago. Red chile pepper meets nutmeg, tobacco, dark chocolate, cinnamon, lactose, cocoa and char. It's not especially thick but there's enough creaminess to cut the heat and it never gets too sweet. \n\nThis is a really nice stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Delicious, I just wish the cinnamon would be toned down a little.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 9/24/20 , RVA\n\nDark mahogany-brown, with 2.5-finger , long-lasting tan head, that leaves waves of lacing, and a 2-3bubble-thick covering of foam, across the whole surface.\n\nSmell is moderate pepper skin, dark, semi-sweet chocolate with a slight tang (reminds me of the chocolate cake batter, that my mom used to make, that had a little sour cream in it) , a bit of peaty char, some cocoa powder, and the barest hint of nutmeg. \n\nTaste is dark chocolate, roasted walnut &amp; almond, (pasilla) pepper, black coffee, cola, burnt cinnamon, allspice, and a touch of creamy vanilla at finish. Light bitterness lingering after finish. No noticeable alcohol, despite being 8.1%, and only a month old. \n\nFeel is lightly creamy, with slight carbonation tingle on the latter half. Surprisingly light , given the abv, and the genberal nature of the brew.\n\nOverall, just a pxleasure, as always. Dangerously easy-dxrinking. Except for the rx*ichness of fxlavor, it seems like a sub-5% brew, rather than 8.1%. I've had this many times before, but never so fresh. The individual components are more apparent now, while older specimens that I've had previously were smoother. Which is bxetter? Hmmmm??? Ask me on any given day, &amp; it cxould go either way. :) I'd rxecommend getting some for now, &amp; some for later, so you can decide what to do in subsequent years. (Cause if you txry this, you'll probably want mxore.)\n* ;) :P"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance was a ruddy burnt orange almost burnt brown color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Hops of orange, followed by a little less of grapefruit and pine nuts. Biscuit, bread malts add great balance. Really nice offering that I would buy if it was available here.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a can into tulip glass a huge 3F mid tan foamy head forms that settles quickly with loose lace from the top to bottom. Color is a coppery dull amber and is about 70% transparent.\n\nThe nose presents a nose that is vegetal as in produce department variety, with just a bit of an off note that I can only describe as veg decay, bong water or over fermented mash. It hints that I am going to be hit with a somewhat dank malty hop bomb.\n\nBig slightly toasted malty mash on the palate with a dry danky bitterness. It starts lightly sweet and smooth on the tongue with a fairly strong toasted grain vibe and ends with lightly dry finish with a danky bitterness. This dank is nowhere as near offputting as the nose.\n\nMouthfeel is medium with a round slickness and warmth to the taste. Carbonation is light and bubbles are fine. Some alcohol tang on the end .\n\nWow, what an odd beer. The nose really is doing me in, some bong water mixed with beer is what I get. Not good. Taste is another matter as it is decent yet I cannot enjoy it because you have to breath. Maybe I got a bad can but it is still less than 2 months old. Perhaps it is the type of hops used that turn it a bit too dank for me.",

Light citrus.\n\nFeel: a little sticky, medium body. Medium carbonation.\n\n\n\nImpressed with how well this holds up at 7 months. Just enough sweetness to carry some east coast into a predominantly west coast ipa.\n\n**",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A classic AIPA, just made right. The up front taste brings a bit of malt and the finish has the hoppy bite expected from this style. My first and quick second in quite a while, I'd forgotten how good this beer is.",

Heavy lacing to the end.\n\nAroma is floral, orange, pine, sweet smelling.\n\nTastes of orange zest, grapefruit, papaya, pine, spruce, resiny, malty.\n\nMedium bodied, lively carbonation. Semi-sweet, bitter finish.\n\nOutstanding! One of the better IPA's",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Six pack of cans picked up at Total Wine in Lynnwood, Washington.\nCanned on OCT 03 2019. Poured in to a pint glass.\n\nLook- Clear bright copper color, solid off-white head with great retention, thick webby lacing. Moderate carbonation streaming as it sits.\n\nSmell- Pithy citrus (Grapefruit and orange), bread and honey malts, a bit of candied fruits and pine, light spicy/herbal tea notes. \n\nTaste- A lot like the aroma, malty with pithy grapefruit and light pine notes, light spiciness. \n\nFeel- Medium/light bodied, a bit abrasive with a solidly bitter finish that lingers, fairly balanced. Moderate carbonation on the tongue. \n\nO- A nice offering, feels a bit more like a British IPA than an American and reminds me of Samuel Smith IPA in a way."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Notes from 2011.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: Pours a nice rocky head. The head looks like chocolate milk so great start so far. Color is almost completely opaque. The little light that filters through shows a dark brown.\n\nS: Smells of luscious chocolate. A good amount of sweetness, almost like frosting. Nice nuttiness and the malt character really comes through.\n\nT: The cocoa is so present, but never seems to take center stage. The milky creaminess starts and is just so mellow. The roasted malts and the bitterness builds beautifully until the hop spice pops the bubble and clears the pallet. It finishes with a long drawn out chocolate aftertaste. The hops are a bit distracting and I honestly wished there was a lot less hops. It balances the drink and cleanses the palate, but I never feel like I get to fully bathe in the richness before being snapped out of it.\n\nO: This is the adult version of a chocolate milk. So smooth, so drinkable. A clear flaw that changes this drink from indulgent to simply great.",

Great lacing.\n\nS: Smells fantastic... big roast and milk chocolate.\n\nT.F: Bittersweet roasted malts. Chocolate is present but not nearly as rich as the aroma would lead you to believe... kind of syrupy. Mild coffee... a bit of hop bittering and pine to boot. Lighter bodied than it should be. Fairly smooth. More bittersweet processed cocoa at the finish.\n\nO: This was decidedly average... and nowhere near as good as the rating would have you believe. Looks good. Smells good. Taste... meh. There are WAY better chocolate stouts out there.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Disappointing. Smells and looks good, but the chocolate flavoring tastes like the chocolate syrup served at a buffet. I’ll skip this the next time I see it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great chocolate stout! i agree, balance between bitter/sweet is off to my palete, leans more bitter for style... not sure if it's Hopping or to much roasted malts.. i think overly hopped! but damn tasty. brown to tan head that lingers awhile, nice aroma, good chocolate in taste, medium mouth feel. carbonation right on! great, could be tweaked to super great! I've turned many people towards dark beer with this one! 50/50 men, women! their dubbel chocolate... an easy 5!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful very dark brown/black appearance. Nice tan head that stays thought drinking it also has great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, slight smoke, and roasted malt. The taste is as described heavy chocolate taste upfront then the roasted malts and oats come through gets quite bitter on the finish. Too bitter in my opinion could do a better job of balancing the sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy, medium bodied and quite dry on the finish, nice amount of carbanation.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a massive, persistent head, leaving ample lace. Cidery carbonation. Clear golden color.\nFaint banana aroma. This is no bubblegum bomb. Taste is light banana with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel on the light side.\nThis is a decent session beer for a Belgian ale with 6.6% ABV.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A light Belgian ale. Not my favorite",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2oz gold foil topped bottle into big mug while in the town chat\n\nClear and puffy white head. Smell is sweet cereal malt and clove. Very, overly sweet and slick feeling. This is probably the best thing InBev makes (even if they do this on the sly) \n\nIt is just okay for a Belgian ale, but sometime this is all you can find",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Clear gold, good head.\n\nSmell: Skunk at first, then cloves and phenol-y yeast.\n\nTaste: Bubblegum sweetness throughout with some cloves and phenolic yeast notes in the finish.\n\nOverall: Decided to try this after seeing it a fair amount on the WBAYDN? Thread. I don't usually go for the Belgian pale ales, but this was enjoyable. I liked the bubblegum note and the yeast notes were complementary instead of distracting. Now I'll have to try their brown ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2 ounce bottle in a standard pint glass.\n\nColorful light golden with reddish tint. 1-plus F linen white cap. Waves of lacing.\n\nApple and pear aromas. Subtle notes of white grape juice and cloves.\n\nCaramel grain, clove, pear and white fruit flavors. Sweet.\n\nLight and sweet. Caramelized fruits.\n\nA bit too sweet.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Totally clear straw gold. Pure white head that doesn’t last long at all, rather thin. Some lacing. \n\nS: Vanilla and sweet malt. Cloves. Cereal grain. \n\nT: sweet. Toasted malt. A little cereal. Reminds me of a cream soda bizarrely, especially the odd after taste. \n\nM: light-medium. More watery than filling for a blond ale. \n\nO: it’s okay. The initial taste is pretty good, but as it goes on the character is lacking and the aftertaste does throw me off. It’s also too light bodied for my taste. I was not overly impressed.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev &quot;Freshest before 1/28/23&quot;; drank 11/21/21 @ the Yarchives. \n\nSee-through golden appearance. \n\nA rough pour yielded a HUGE off-white head (careful pouring!); a thick curtain of lace. \n\nClove, caramel &amp; apple cider notes in the nose. \n\nCreamy medium mouthfeel. \n\nBanana &amp; clove flavors up front; mild caramel &amp; faint apple cider notes on the finish. \n\nSubstantial &amp; flavorful, but easy to drink...I'd have another!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2oz bottle. Label has best by date of '17/12/22'.\nClear, pale gold colored body. Multi finger of frothy off white head. Leaves rings of lacing.\nAroma of toasted malts, along with what the label describes as &quot;notes of vanilla and cloves&quot;.\nTaste is slightly harsh and slightly sweet at the same time. Standard toasted malt base, with esters of vanilla and cloves.\nMedium mouthfeel, but feels airy in the mouth. Excellent carbonation.\nPleasant enough, and better than an average American adjunct lager, but with a higher ABV%. I would not go out of my way to obtain more, but I would not turn down one if presented.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Golden color with a rich foamy off white head. Definite aroma of clove, fruity esters, and a hint of vanilla. Malt base smells slightly adjunct which leads me to believe this beer will taste low in character. Taste is a little flat with hints of vanilla and spice. The base beer just doesn't have the inviting quality of a good golden ale. Taste like an adjunct with flavors added.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 330ml bottle into a pint glass. Best by 11/10/22, so plenty fresh. \n\nLooks pretty good in the glass. Dark golden yellow body. Big bubbly white head shrinks to a collar and covering, scattered lacing.\n\nSpice and vanilla aroma, a hint of banana. A little boozy too.\n\nOn tasting, lightly sweet, vanilla more forward with a spiced ending. Abv apparent, seems just a little harsh.\n\nMouth between medium and full, finish full, a little bitey, on the sweet side.\n\nOverall, a fair amount going on, certainly not a smooth beer. Happy to have tried it, wouldn't want a regular diet of it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Golden color, high carbonation, some foam. On the malty side, quite sweet actually. Followed by some other flavors, somewhat bitter, perhaps hops or spices. My mouth not developed enough to say. After trying so many different style, nice to come back to a Belgian, always like them, this one included. Now i need to find the darker one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev tastes like carbonated cloves with a bit of sweetness. It's very good on occasion.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Big frothy white head. Good retention. Maybe the most lacing I've ever seen. This is the reason it gets high marks for appearance. Yeasty nose, followed by the whiff of ethanol sharpness typical of Belgians, perhaps a hint of citrus. Taste follows the nose. Quite sweet. Biscuit malt, hint of citrus, followed by the ethanol, drying cloves and pepto bismol on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smoothish, but leaves the tongue sticky. Overall just okay. I'm not a big fan of the pepto bismol aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear golden homie. White head. Lace.\n\nBananas, cloves, yeast. Wheat flavors. Reminds me of a German hefe but a Belgian version. Smooth, easy drinking. Soft feel. Bananas, clove, bubblegum finish.",

And at this point, you could have put 3 day old horchata in my glass and i’d still be stoked. But nah, it ain’t like that. Raul is with Miss Raul and her amazingly beautiful family, and he has a half decent drink going on. It’s nothing like taking Mrs. Brussels for a spin on the old pogo stick, but it’s a nice adventure nonetheless.\n\nSee ya.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear, amber gold appearance with a large white head and good lacing. Yeasty aroma, some fruitiness, and esters typically associated with the style.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Truly a unique beer. Got this in a &quot;Best of Belgium&quot; variety 12 pack that came with original Stella &amp; Hoegaarden. Gotta admit it's one of the more &quot;WTF&quot; flavors I've ever tasted in a &quot;beer.&quot;\n\nWhen I say: &quot;WTF?!&quot; I don't mean it in a bad way.\n\nThis is a unique beer and should be tried at LEAST once by ANY beer drinker.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into snifter. Ruby brown, a good khaki cream head that abates to a persistent but thin ring and a big blotch of lace. \n\nNose is dark fruits and malt.\n\nTaste is the same, very malty sweet, some banana notes with the dark fruits. Delightful.\n\nFeel is crazy smooth especially with that ABV.\n\nYears ago, this was my first fancy Belgian ale. It's still great.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful beer. Lovely clear red amber, with a big, tan, pillowy, three finger, Belgian head. The aroma is dominated by cherry, caramel, and red wine, with a hint of ethanol. The taste is a symphony of fkavour: berries, caramel, red wine, brown sugar, and noticeable but very well balanced alcohol. This is by far the smoothest and most agreeable 10.5% I've ever had. This is great stuff, and widely available, so get some and enjoy it. If someone wanted to know what Belgian beer is like, I would give him one of these as the archetypal Belgian.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Served at 4°C. 1,5€ 0,33l from Lidl.\nL: Huge marvellous head that slowly recedes (5 min) into a thin lacing. Brown-Dark amber opaque colour. \nS: Malts and caramel.\nT: Taste of smoked malt, caramel, nuts, spices, bittersweet (more on the bitter side) and complex.\nF: Low carbonation. Medium bodied. Heavy ABV.\nVery good warming winter beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Deep reddish brown body with a thin tan head. Aroma of dark fruits, red wine, and strong caramel malt as well as some spice. Taste is slightly fruity with a lot of nice touches from the wine yeast. Finish is spicy caramel cookie. This is a perilously easy drinking strong ale. It drinks like a lighter belgian red ale, but packs a nice warming touch at the end. One of a kind world class ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 10/11/2021 The appearance of the bottle itself is exceptional. The first to pour out was a little bit of head. Crystal clear very dark amber, big foamy creamy persistent head. Very lacy. What a beautiful beer; Aroma is mild and good. (my sniffer is ineffectual); Flavor is pretty good; Mouthfeel is smooth and sparkly; My overall impression is very good, based primarily on appearance. If I hadn't been able to see this beer, I probably wouldn't have liked it so much. But even then it's better than average.\n\n10/20/2021 The flavor is rich, smooth, robust. I bump the taste rating from 3.75 to 4. I like this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 11.2oz bottle coded 18AU poured into a Gulden Draak tulip glass at fridge temp 10.5% ABV. The beer pours bright in a dark amber color with light brown head. The head builds quickly and settles slowly to a half inch cap. Spotty lacing. The aroma is brown sugar, sweet malt and Belgian yeast spice that's more clove than anything. The taste is semisweet clovey malt with notes of berry, cherry, brown sugar, caramel and dark dried fruits. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle. Reddish with island and lace. Fruity boozy strong herbal aroma. Very sweet with lots of fruit cherry red apple with boozy herbal finish. Medium body lively and fine. Very herbal and fruity for a tripel. Still good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle. Deep amber. Thick frothy head\nFruity, yeasty and spicy aroma. Rich in phenols. \nTastes of bananas, and rumtopf. Molasses and mixed spice are apparent. Boozy. Demi-sec. \nLots of soft carbonation. Mid to high body.\nTypically Belgian. Complex and a nice sipper with my Belgian braised liver.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Part of a variety 6-pack $23.79 Tamuras 11.2oz bottle\n2019 Edition so 2 years old\nSmell of spices, rum soaked raisins\nBrown-reddish color\nHeavy-medium mouthfeel\nHigh carbonation. Shooted a little as I popped the top. Stayed high after pour.\nTaste of spices, pepper, banana, prunes, cinnamon, figs\nOverall a fantastic beer. As I just bought this beer in a boxed 6-pack I was surprised that it is from 2019 as this was put on the shelf rather recently so they must age it at the brewery. When a high ABV beer can hide the alcohol so well you know its well made.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smells fruity and funky like an alcoholic fruit cake.  There is a real depth to the scent.\n\nIt tastes sweet and very alcoholic.  There's like a spiced raisin taste.\n\nIt's thin but has a massive amount of carbonation.  The finish is sweet like a plum and then there's finally a grainy taste.\n\nIt's a brilliant Belgian.  I give it a 5.1 out of 6.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Dark mahogany color with an aggressive, four finger head of dense beige foam. Good retention and lacing.\n\nAroma: Figs, dates, toffee, caramel, raisins and mildly sweet cherry.\n\nTaste: Dried red fruits - mostly follows the nose with figs, plums and cherries . Notes of floral banana and very gentle bittersweet chocolate. Decently hoppy, with a nice resinous finish. Dry and well attenuated. 10.5% ABV is apparent, but not overbearing. Hints of herbal grape must, probably from the Bordeaux wine yeast.\n\nFeel: Bubbly. Medium density. \n\nOverall: Better on tap than out of the bottle. I'm sure you could cellar this under the right conditions to really get some interesting flavors however."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance - The beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head. \n\nSmell - The smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style. \n\nTaste - The malts backbone was huge, leaving a trail of sweetness. The dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast. Nothing was overpowering, and a dry finish left me thirsty for more. \n\nMouthfeel - The beer was full bodied, allowing the aftertaste to linger. \n\nOverall - It has been too long since I had this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Terrific red imperial ale!!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Too hoppy for my taste.\nOtherwise a very solid beer for the style, but not red.\nMore of a slightly darker honey.\nOld Chub is much better!\nTo me, this tastes like the rest of the IPA's in this style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can.\nL: Hazy, red/amber colour with two fingers of off-white suds that leave rings of lacing.\nS: Malt and some subtle cinnamon spiciness.\nT: Red liquorice, orange and caramel. Unusual. Alcohol heat follows, as does moderate hop bitterness.\nF: Full bodied with slick mouthfeel. \nO: A decent Autumnal red ale that also delivers a boozy hit. Not very subtle, however.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Chilled 12 oz. can poured into a chilled mug. Canned 08/28/21 stamped on bottom of can. Consumed 11/06/21. My wife bought a single can of this randomly for me to try. It is the highest-ranked beer on this site that I have consumed to date, rated #3 in the Red Ale - Imperial style and #3,096 overall at time of writing. \n\nL: Dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. A slight amount of bubbles. 3.75\n\nS: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0\n\nT: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. This is a higher ABV than I am accustomed to, which might account for the issues. Bitterness from hops is about the only other thing I can discern. I get no sweetness, at all, even as the brew warmed. 2.75\n\nF: Not very easy or enjoyable to drink. 3.0\n\nO: Not for me. 3.0",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Yet another great Oskar offering! Beautiful to behold, with deeper colors at the top of the glass. I guess just because the top is wider? Anyway, a cool effect \nMaybe just a little malty with the high alcohol content, but great mouthfeel.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice foamy head. Reddish brown body. Smell is pine resin, pineapple, mango, and spice. Taste is bold- piney hops and mango dominate. Caramel malt and maybe even cinnamon come out in the body, but take a back seat to the hops. That being said, the bitterness is well balanced by malt sweetness. Feel is wet, and a lovely warmth is produced by the ABV. It’s a really good beer, and a great take on red ales. My only critique is that the malt character could be a bit more present.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer has a slight harshness to its hops that mellows somewhat as it warms, but is nonetheless a discernable aftertaste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Delicious imperial red ale. Malty with spicy hops and a long dry finish. Flavors are pronounced and stick around a good long time. Chewy, caramel, lemon, vanilla, herbal spice. Lots going on. A powerhouse of flavor and texture. Very excellent brew to be savored.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass. &quot;Canned 2/19/:33 Cheers 2 Gordon&quot;. Well, Gordon, I have no idea who you are or what you've done, but Cheers 2 you.\n\nL---A rich reddish brown that turns out to just be deep amber. Off-white head faded to a ring fairly quickly and leaves good lacing. \n\nS---Vaguely hoppy &amp; malty. I can't identify specifics.\n\nT---Same as the nose, vague hops &amp; malts. \n\nF---Medium bodied with very good carbonation. \n\nO---Just not doing it for me. An otherwise excellent brewery, though.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I 10000% need to have this more than once to get a better opinion, I definitely don't not like this, idk if ill come back to it once I get a better feel for its taste but this is definitely seems complex. Finkel and garf has a red ipa, which as I understand should be more malt driven, and I understand what they meant. This seems different, perhaps more hoppy, I think the alcohol is covered well, not like a lot of weldwerks doubles were I taste the alcohol. Its not that the malt isn't there....I need to have this again. It's good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev definitely unusual and it works for me. ipa with a strong caramel note.\nL: drinking from the can, and the can is cool.\nS: pine, bitter citrus.\nT: goes beyond the nose... get the pine, grapefruit but a good taste of caramel richness with just a bit of sweetness. works for me. bitterness grows through the aftertaste, and the final impression is actually pretty bitter. strange but it works.\nF: smooth, rich. nice. \nO: different but different in a good way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Reviewed from memory, as I have not had in a while, have had at least a four-pack.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not a huge fan of most ipas, but this one's not half bad. It's not as hoppy as a lot of them, and has a lighter carbonation. At 8.7% pits a not a bad choice. If you like ipas with a little less hops I would recommend.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Haven't had many red IPA's but this one is delicious. Super easy to drink. May be the best red ale I've ever had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A real beauty to look at; the reddish amber body is topped it a large khaki colored head that left plenty of lacing. Laid back aroma features an array of hops, pine being the most prominent, although there is some caramel lurking in the background. Hops continue to dominate the taste. Pine is still present but joined by herbal, floral notes. Tongues a-tingling heading to the aftertaste where that caramel sweetness makes another brief appearance. Noticing a bit of grapefruit as well. Lingering well carbonated finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Deep copper color, about two fingers of foam.\nSmell: Hoppy. Some type of candied fruit. Grapefruit.\nTaste: Sweet and bitter. Puckery. I don't think I can pin down any one flavor. Grapefruit rind comes to mind. Maybe some simple syrup. Maybe some sugar cookie. Everything just kind of blends together.\nFeel: Silky. Oily.\nTaste: Yeah that's some good shit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a can into a tulip glass a massive 3F mid tan foamy head sits atop a medium amber beer about 40% transparent. Lace starts at the top and slides down the glass as the head slowly sinks over several minutes.\n\nOn the nose I get sweaty salty hops predominantly with hints of yeast and mash and some mystery note.\n\nTaste is caramel malt at first then bitter hop and a boozy finish. The unidentified note is a pine resin hops trying to hide the alcohol astringency. A hint of thymol makes this a bit too booze like for me.\n\nMouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation that acts as a catalyst to the thymol, piney alcohol and creates a tingly aftertaste. This takes away from the initial malt notes and finishes slick and sticky.\n\nThis beer has just too much alcohol and bitterness for me. Parts of the flavor profile hint at schnapps in a beer boilermaker. The Listerine aftertaste is a major turnoff for me. Struggling to get through the rest of the glass, yup drain pour.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev LOOK - quite hazy - deep orange/slight copper - nice soapy foam - great head retention - foam clings to the glass\nSMELL - pine, grapefruit, and some mango - some woodsy/campfire notes - caramel as well\nTASTE - huge blast of hops but not as bitter as I anticipated - super tropical and some citrus - some pine and mango - partially sweet but mostly tart with a nice hop bite\nFEEL - a bit thinner that hoped for but still a nice medium body - great carbonation - activity level is high\nOVERALL - a very good Imperial IPA from Oskar B's - never had a bad brew from them - this is a powerful brew - a taste bud killer - very hoppy and a decent carmelly sweetness to help balance it out - one of the better IIPA / RIPAs out there"

You’ll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms. I agree. Tasty stuff. Big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty/ tea-like malts without the sweetness being a turnoff.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The can I have isn't expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale. If this how this normally is then it's honestly awful to me. Zero hops just malt, like this is so disappointing I'll have to try again to see.\n\n\nSeeing as how I have the lowest review on here I looked at others and they're all as flabbergasted as I am. I really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.\n\n\nUpdate, after trying again I more or less confirmed what I thought while also liking this more. Still not for me but for those more into malty IPA'S.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rerate, 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.1%., 85 IBU. Orange to amber colour, slightly hazy. Moderate but lasting off-white head with an orangey hue. Pleasant aroma of fruity American hops. The flavour is an aggressive hoppy explosion from start to finish, on a malty sweet (too sweet?) background. Very bitter aftertaste. &quot;Not for the faint of heart&quot; - but I MIGHT get used to this ... I’m upping it a point. Original rating: Bottle, at The Rover, Göteborg. Amber colour, hazy. Sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour, but also plenty of hops, as expected from a &quot;double IPA&quot;. A bit overdone on both sweetness and hops in my book, but still a good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Six pack of cans purchased at Total Wine in Lynnwood, Washington.\nCanned on SEP 24 2019. Poured in to an Erdinger pint glass.\n\nLook- Slightly hazy darker golden amber color, glorious off-white head that slowly recedes, beautiful lacing. Light carbonation streaming as it sits.\n\nSmell- Citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), honey/caramel malts, resinous pine, over-ripe tropical fruits (mango, passionfruit and light pineapple), some stone fruit. Light spicy/herbal notes. \n\nTaste- The honey sweet malts are much more prevalent in the taste than the aroma. The hoppy fruitiness and pine assert themselves in the finish, well balanced. \n\nFeel- Rich, full bodied with faint alcohol tones. Very smooth with a solid semi-dry bitter finish. Moderate carbonation on the tongue. \n\nO- A really nice DIPA. A little pricey but I'll be coming back to this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 1/22/12: Pours deep gold/pale amber with 2 fingers of frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head which leaves a heavy, pasty lacing behind as it recedes. Aroma is citrusy orange hops and sweet caramel malts. Taste is huge hoppiness! Oily with orange zest in a malt background of cane syrup and caramel. Big hop bite and bitterness from start into the aftertaste. Taste is complex, almost in an abbey ale sort of way. Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% ABV until the brew reaches room temperature where it blossoms.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Found this at T0tal W!ne in Houston after missing it on the local shelves for several years. \nProbably more than a bit overpriced i.e. you can find better brews for less money. But, it's an excellent beer, good taste but not overly hopped and little or no juniper or other cringe-worthy (for some people!) ingredients. Herc is a very worthwhile brew which has been around for quite a while. If you're looking to test drive an IPA, this is a great choice."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Translucent deep brownish-red, with light, quickly-dissipating tan head. \n\nSmell? Think red wine vinegar, softened by (dried, then moistened) cherry, oak and a touch of vanilla. I say &quot;vinegar&quot;, but it's softer, more rounded than that, and not as strong. A partner of the other elements, not dominating them. \n\nTaste is is dried cherry, a touch of raisin, the aforementioned red wine vinegar, some oak tannin, and a hint of booze-soaked vanilla. \n\nFeel is smooth/slick - it looks at &quot;lightly syrupy&quot;, but doesn't actually go there - , light-medium, with light, very,very,very fine carbonation tingle. Some acetic mucilaginous feel at the back of the palate, eventually with a slight drying effect in the front. \n\nOverall, just wonderful. I've had this before, but not in a long, long time. I need to not wait so long for the next time. It lives up to billing, and deserves its high ranking. :)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from the 11.2 oz bottle into the test glass.\nA - A ruddy, brown color, very little cap, very fine carbonation accumulates as a ring along the glass walls\nS - Dark cherries, vanilla tannin, oak, some sweet malts, aged balsamic, and green apple skins.\nT - Dark stone fruit, some ever so slight vanilla, a bit of late harvest grape, as the offering warms, the earthy elements pop. Grainy malts, with earthy musty threads. This is very complex\nM - Medium body, semi sweet, then a shift towars slightly sour. Texture is luxurious, slick with a slightly tart linger.\nVery cordial like with the gentle carbonation.\nO - A bit of a revelation in 11.2 oz's. Outstanding texture, Softened by oak, the acididty doesn't run wild. The tannin touch is deft. Overall exceptional",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev More brown than red, slightly hazy, one finger of khaki head. The smell and taste are extremely complex, dominated by fruit, red wine tannins, and vinegar, but in a good way. The flavour of this stuff sure packs a wallop. It finishes with the dominant sourness only slightly mellowed out by sweetness. Overall, a wonderfully complex beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Excellent brownish-red body with lots of lively carbonation; thick, spongy head. A beautiful aroma of cherry and raspberry; earthy mustiness. The taste flows along with the smell; rich, fruity tartness; raw oak; moderate sourness. Heavy body; velvety residual sugar note; moderate tartness; fairly sweet overall.\n\nThis is a fantastically rich and inviting Flanders red ale. It brings all the hallmarks of the beer style to the front. I don't find it overly sour nor over-carbonated and fizzy like some I've experienced. This one is heavy with complexity and nuance.\n\nPoured at 45 F; bottling date (I guessing): September 08th, 2020 (label had JD 0.252 13 17:47)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Visual: scarce coarse ocher colored foam, dark brown beer with amber reflections, veiled.\nNose: high intensity with fruity, acidulous, grape, light caramel and malt descriptors.\nTaste: very intense with acidic, sour descriptors and sweet finish. Ripe grapes and ripe cherries, caramel. Acidic aftertaste of grapes always fighting with a very elegant fined sweetness. Mouth sensation of astringency and pungent carbonation with medium and soft.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 330 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. There is clear bottling information, but I'm nowhere near smart enough to decipher the code. \n\nL---Opaque brown in my glass, but it was clear with a strong reddish tint while pouring it through light. Fluffy khaki head faded quickly and left ok lacing. \n\nS---You can smell the sourness. Strong fruitiness. Tart cherries.\n\nT---Wow, this is really good. Sour cherries, light red wine vinegar. \n\nF---Much fuller bodied than expected from a relatively light 6.0% ABV. \n\nO---This earns its world class status. So glad I bought two.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 91",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a pint glass. A hazy reddish brown with a thin tan head that soon diminished to a ring which stuck around to the end.\n\nFairly strong clean, sweet and tart fruit smells.\n\nTaste is vinous. Malty and mildly sour up front. A very long sweetish aftertaste. Some oak and leather present. Well melded.\n\nVery smooth for a Flemish Red. Medium to light body and carbonation.\n\nOverall a world class Flemish red. Well balanced and refreshing. Mildly sour, fruity and funky.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rodenbach Grand Cru is clear and a deep red color, with leathery highlights. Head is dense, packed, cream colored, and lasting.\nOn the nose, Rodenbach is tart and fruity up front, smelling pleasantly of sour, ripe cherries. I can practically picture the juiciness of those cherries as they fall from the tree straight into my beer. Oak and vanilla lend support while softening the beer’s overall sourness. This may be my imagination but I could swear I find hints of leather hiding behind the aromas of oak. Unbaked bread lends itself to the flavors, helping the oak in its bid to soften those flavors of ripe fruit tartness.\nOn the tongue, Rodenbach is smooth and medium bodied. CO2 provides a spritzy carbonation that dances across the tongue. Soft flavors of unbaked bread give a platform for up front tartness which combines deftly with flavors of ripe fruit. Flavors give me ripe cherry as well as red grape minus the tannins. The finish has a lot going on each in its own subtle fashion. Chiefly there’s an earthy quality. Earthiness blends nicely with fruit as well as leather tinted flavors of oak. All of which combines to provide a very gentle flavor profile.\nLike previous Flanders Reds, this one has some great character and great balance. Tartness and flavors of ripe fruit dominate without overpowering. Oak aging and a general bready quality help prevent this beer from being too strong in its tartness. Rather, it’s a delicious, refreshing, and greatly accessible example of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I'll keep this brief - wonderful classic beer. It's one of those beers that I've seen on the shelf for years without trying. Now I wonder what took so long. \n\nOver the last several months, the Flanders Red style has emerged as on of my favorites. So much flavor to be had here!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Four-pack copped from Bottle King in Livingston. Pours a blood-orange, deep amber hue with minimal frothing. Assertive aroma replete with notes of sour pear and apricot. Full-bodied mouthfeel with a tart, sour finish. Burst-in-your mouth taste exploding with a cornucopia of wild ale flavors ranging from Granny Smith apples to plum wine. Awesome, authentic example of the style. High marks all around.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rich flavorful beer! Excellent. Celebrating a new car purchase!\n\nPoured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Deep, dark reddish brown color with excellent beige head and beautiful curtain lacing. Cherry and blackberry smell and taste. Some raspberries and lemon. Rich, smooth feel. Great beer!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2022 re-review\n\nA decent interpretation of a belgian IPA, not really anything to write home about but not terrible. Deffinitely has more of an IPA than a belgian character, that can be a good or a bad thing depending on what youre looking for.\n\nPours a translucent orange/brass color with a one finger off white head that laces the glass well.\nAroma is bitter and herbal, fairly nondescript besides notes of grapefruit rind and caramel.\n\nMalt bill is strong and competes for control with the hops. Has a sweet caramel / honey / candied orange flavor predominantly. Yeasty belgian flavor only appears on the aftertaste, its nice but not as bold as I would have expected - showcasing decent flavors of banana and very mild clove. Finishes bitter and dry with hoppy notes of orange zest.\n\nMid weight body. Alcohol profile is moderate, you can tell its almost 9% yet at the same time this is oddly sessionable.\n\nThis is an enjoyable beer for sure; I come back to it every now and then when I want something thirst quenching but strong in ABV.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light ipa, first sip tastes great, too sweet tho so after a bit gets old. Don't think I would buy again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 3/1/21....pours medium copper amber with light head of off white foam. Cherry fruit and yeasty nose. Spicy fruity flavor. Some cherry. Black currants too. Deep and powerful body. Leaves with an earthy gritty bitter. Solid.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Brownish copper in color with a white head. Nose is spices and pungency. Taste follows the nose with a spicy, white pepper dryness that quickly grips the palate with a piney bitterness. Good Beer with a different spin on IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev First off I have to say that I’m not a fan of the name of this beer. It’s 2021 Flying Dog. You can do better. \nPours a deep amber with two fingers of fluffy white head. \nAroma of cooked pear with toffee and some spice. Fruity\nSlightly sweet fruit flavor up front balanced by a hoppy bitter finish. I get a lot of pear and citrus with a bit of banana clove spice. Pine hop finish. \nI enjoyed this beer but probably won’t revisit.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours a clear copper with a white head Nice lacing. \nS: I’m picking up clove and fruity yeast\nT: Piney hops, Belgian yeast. Interesting. \nF: Medium bodied with a dry finish \nO: I like the style a lot and this is a pretty good example of it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours dark amber with a thin white head that leaves much lacing. Aroma is typical Belgian with the fruity/clove notes. Taste is as advertised, sharp fruity flavors, with that Belgian banana/clove background. There is some hoppyness in there too, but the fruit flavors dominate. Feel is also as advertised, sharp and drying. Overall, you get what is advertised, but it's not my favorite, but it is interesting.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Clear orange colour, big off-white head. Lovely strong aroma of fruity and piney American hops, notes of oranges and slightly caramellized orange marmalade. The flavour is a hoppy explosion from start to finish, fruity (orange marmalade) first, very bitter in the end. There is a considerable malty sweetness that stands up to the bitterness. I don’t get many &quot;Belgian&quot; notes out of this &quot;Belgian IPA&quot;, it is all very American to me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle. Best by date is stamped on label as '05:23:21'.\nMostly clear, medium amber colored body. One thin finger of white head recedes to thin cap. Leaves some partial lacing walls away from the drinking side.\nAroma of Belgian yeast, with hint of toasted malt and piney hops.\nTaste is up front with piney hops, with a good malt base and an expression of the Belgian yeast. Also has some sweeter tropical fruit hops that emerge late. Aftertaste goes to a sweet mellow place with a blend of the main components. Both the initial flavor push and the end game are tasty, although with different emphasis and balance.\nMedium mouth feel, with a bit of syrup. Very good carbonation. There is some piney bitterness but not to a burn or stinging experience.\nAll components get to present and together they work well in a blend and balance. Flavorful IPA, and more distinct because of the yeast smell and taste. Wild side art work on the label.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear copper caramel color with a fluffy white head and nice lacing.\n\nBelgian yeast on the nose with a bit of spice and malt in the background. Maybe a hint of dank hop but its light if its there at all.\n\nLuckily the hoppiness is there in the taste. Dank, piney hops up front with the malty Belgian spice flavors coming through in the finish. At times the flavors almost seem to be competing, but really I think they mostly balance out pretty well. The booziness is well hidden.\n\nMouthfeel is light and easy to sip with nice, zippy carbonation. \n\nThis is pretty nice for something different. Turns out that Belgian flavors and west-coast hop flavors marry pretty well. It's just starting to feel like Spring here and I'd say that's the right time to drink one of these. You don't necessarily want all the tropical hop flavors of a NEIPA, so the roasty malt flavors in this one work nicely when there's still a hint of chill in the air.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Id drink it again. Largely belgian and small-ly ipa but good none the less.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the growler via Sunoco Amelia (!!!!!) in a snifter. This fine\n&quot;coulda' swore I reviewed ya'&quot; brew pours a nice peach tinged \npale amber with a fantastic head of white foam that settles to a thick ring\nand layer with excellent lacing. Nose of mango, pineapple, herbal hops,\npine hops, and honey sweet malts. Flavors follow but surpass by presentation\nwith caramel malts, pineapple, mango, papaya, light yeasty notes of fresh\nbread, and pine hops. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light\ncarbonation that is soft and lightly creamy, and a bitter hop yet subtly\nsweet finish that is moderately dry.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it years ago and still dig it for a nice change of pace!\n\nCheers",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours amber with a nice 1/2 inch head, decent lacing \nit has a citrus ,tangerine and pine, smell\nTaste is orange, grapefruit, pine,\nMedium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by 11/4/20...Shit\n\nEven though it's a bit past freshness (my fault for neglecting it for so long), this is still my first Belgian IPA. What the hell does that mean anyways? A yeast forward IPA? Oh well. This seems to be the flagship example of the style, though not exactly the highest rated\n\nPours a clear orange amber with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves patchy lacing\n\nHonestly the aroma reminds me of a Belgian pale, and that might be due to the hops having faded. I pick up notes of lemon, toast, pepper, bubblegum esters, dirty wheat, and grassy hops\n\nThe taste starts off sharp and slightly bitter, with notes of lemon, pepper, and piney hops. The swallow brings notes of clove, doughy pale malt, and grassy hops\n\nA surprisingly light feel for the abv. Medium bodied with fine carbonation for a very crisp beer. Finishes dry and almost sparkling. Probably the best part of the experience\n\nThis was honestly nothing mind blowing, even for my first of he style. Like I said, it is essentially a Belgian pale, just with more hops. Though I assume they've faded significantly with time. I'd try it again, it would probably go good with food",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pretty nice amber color; clear\n\nS: Sweet, Hoppy, Peaches, Floral, its pretty good\n\nT: Taste is smooth, hoppy, woody flavor with a small alcohol bite, for 8.3% I was expecting more boozy, pleasantly surprised none to find. The taste is pretty good overall. \n\nF: excellent feel perfect effervescence and smooth at the same time.\n\nO: Pretty good beer definitely would purchase again. I got it in a variety pack and I do like the brewery. Would recommend to friends.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L- The lable is surprising in several ways, 1) it's unexpectedly explicit especially for an American beer, 2) it's by the Welsh artist Ralph Steadman, friend of Hunter S. Thompson &gt; 'Fear &amp; Loathing...' etc, album sleeves for The Who, Frank Zappa etc etc, the man is prodigious!; and 3) it features my ex-wife, yes really! Phew, and after that latter thought I'm certainly ready for a bit of an afternoon 'stiffener' of a beer.\nS- Seems to be a blend of spice and fruit. It's notably aromatic (spice) but perfumed (fruit) as well.\nT- Ok, I sipped and pre-winced in preparation... tic... toc... tic. It's not as lethal as expected. The perfumed aspect seem the more prominent in the taste now. It's somewhat dry and fully in balance it's neither OTT or at all challenging - note I'm not into mega or majorly over-prominent hopping.\nF- It's big, deep, pungent, and has a minor zingy hop flourish in the finish. But it has richness balanced down in there too. Nothing is over-prominent vs the whole, I like it more than anticipated.\nO- Apparently Raging Bitch refers to the hops used and how they 'rage' and foam like... one.\nFor a beer somewhat hoppier/dryer than my usual picks it's very drinkable. The solid meat of this 8.3% sized package tames the bitchier side of the hops. The Bitch continues yielding prodigious head, most satisfying too.\n\nBought from BeersOfEurope/UK for home delivery. 330ml bottle BB: 28/05/2021. £3.45"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Time and a place, ice cold tall can kinda tasted pretty good on this road trip lol",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not amazing, but not bad. This clear straw colored beer is simple but at the very least refreshing on a hot day. Sweet smelling with hints of corn on the nose. Tastes strangely like apple juice to me. Not in a gross way just in a weird way. Sweet with a good fizz and simple wheat beer on top of that. Not my favorite cheap beer, but certainly not bottom of the barrel. Good for beer drinker on the budget, hot summer days, summer parties, or if you just in the mood for it which is rare, but not unheard of for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Probably the best of the cheap macro beers. Perfect for mowing the lawn, or if you're hosting a BBQ and want to offer an unassuming and inoffensive beer to the guests. It has a sweetness to it, but without the gross corn syrupy cheapness associated with many other budget brands. It boasts a very light head that disappears quickly. It's light as a feather, with no discernible aftertaste. I reach for one of these if I just want &quot;a beer&quot; without having to stop and appreciate it to feel like I got my money's worth. At just under $15 for a 24 pack, it's easy to down these like soda guilt free. They were also immortalized in the film Do the Right Thing by Da Mayor, if not to the degree PBR was in Blue Velvet.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev First beer I ever ordered. The old Errol Morris commercials (which were on a good decade before I turned 21) stuck with me and resonated with their version of Midwest manhood. I know when to rake leaves and how to back a trailer into a driveway, so of course I would enjoy a High Life!\n\nI've expanded my palette since those days, but I still reminisce over a cold one from time to time. A light golden color with plenty of big bubbles and some thin lacing. The smell and taste are a bit weak and typically simple for an AAL. It's those bubbles that elevate the feel and enhance the experience.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev IT was good when I was 17, but the I learned what good beer is via German imports, then Guinness, then the USA craft market blew up and now there's real beer made the right way. This is the opposite of that. Bad beer made the wrong way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s a sweet tasting/ smelling beer. Little to no foamy head. No real lacing around the glass. A simple light amber colored beer. Not bad at all especially for the price 7$ for a 12pk . I mean I can’t complain not my go too but not an offensive beer at all. Better than alot of other cheaper beers.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 24oz can. Stamped on can bottom is best by date of 'DEC2021'.\nClear, straw colored body. First pour brought forth a multi finger white head, which receded back to a thin skiff. Left behind an extensive pattern of lacing.\nAroma of sweet malt and corn. Similar to a perfume.\nTaste of slightly sweet malt and corn. Slight floral hops. Completely drying in the aftertaste, that calls for another sip or quaff.\nThinner mouth feel, but crisp. Good carbonation.\nLeaves no memory of what has just been imbibed. Just repeat and take another quaff. No real alcohol presence, but induces the burps. Drink cold and get a crisp, quick experience.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very over-rated beer with an abundance of commercials glorifying it. To me, this is just an even worse version of Miller Lite.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear gold with a strong head for style. Light cereal nose. Light malt body, faint flavour, a little dryness. Reasonably crisp but not much there.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Champagne of beers! It has a distinct taste, but it is beer for sitting down the park with a campfire in the middle of winter when you are down on your luck and have no money for the bar. It is you and your friends huddled around a fire to keep warm. This beer brings me back to Winter 2009 when a 30 pack of cans came in a camouflaged box and you did not need to have a cooler with ice becase it was (34F / 1C) outside and it was cold enough. Next thing you know the case is gone, you and your friends are tired and you crawl home in the misery freezing snow and crawl into bed. It was a tough time then for the economy and well an economy beer is what you need. I would drink this instead of miller lite, but this is a pass up beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s a full step below bud and banquet beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16 oz. can poured into Imperial Pint glass\nLook: Light straw, nearly transparent, heavy carbonation, 4-finer creamy head, nice lacing\nSmell: Rice, light hops with a little spice,\nTaste: Dry with some corn sweetness, no bitterness, slight malt, not much of a finish\nFeel: Highly carbonated, nice mouthfeel\nOverall: Simple, thirst quenching and easy to drink. Taste and smell are not offensive. Textbook lager adjunct with no surprises.\nPair with salty snack foods such as pretzels, popcorn, peanuts, and chips, as well as meals like fish tacos, summer salads, and spiced seafood.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I made a mistake in calling Miller Genuine Draft the Champagne of Beers. That honor goes to Miller High Life. A rather thin head rapidly dissipated as it went into the glass The scent is very, very faint and I'm having a hard time placing it... it is both slightly sweet and slightly like plastic burn in an electrical fire mixed with asphalt (which - like asphalt - made me ever-so slightly nauseous as I huffed it to try and pinpoint the odor). Champagne-colored, maybe, though a bit too coppery. The tiny bubbles disappear almost as quickly as the head did. Drinking it, the sweetness is still there and the asphalt is gone. However, the aftertaste is a bit like electrical fire, though the mouthfeel is weak. I'm glad I made the mistake of thinking MGD was what my brother drank, as this I'll finish (probably) and forever banish it from my table in the future. It seems more like the beer of champagnes, or - better - the result of pouring a bunch of left over champagne glasses from the remains of a wedding into a single container, chilling it, then serving it up.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16 oz can of the high life. Develops a Snow White head that keeps for a while straw colored malt. Extremely light and refreshing that is best suited as an inoffensive thirst quencher. I can’t find any hops here. Lots of carbonation making this more akin to an adult soda. No transcendental experience here, just a descent thirst quencher.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Seems to be a love/hate type of beer... I never tried it with food, but on its own it's kind of sweet. The initial smell is okay (a hint of fermented grains), the first few sips are okay (does taste like beer), but halfway through the after-taste become sweet, like corn syrup kind of sweet. Never expected that from a beer... if you want to try it, it's also sold in 473ml cans, but one and see if this beer is your thing."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing. Aroma is dark roast, dark fruit, chocolate, a little cherry and smoke. Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma. There's a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it. Unfortunately, although a good beer, when reaching for a smoky fix I go for O'Fallon's smoked porter, Yazoo Sue, or Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;It pours a deep dark black yielding a spectacular one inch white foamy head leaving some nice lumpy valleys in the head. The head dies within a minute. The smell is a roasty, dry coffee sort of thing going on with a nice amount of hops allocated inside of some light cocoa. The taste is dry, roasty, bitter and sweet at different times throughout the beer. Some burnt malts seem to come through a bit as the beer warms. The palate is medium to heavy coating my mouth and tongue nicely like it should on a cold winter’s night. Sharpness is slightly there.

A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.\n\nMOUTHFEEL\nSmooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.\n\nOVERALL\nWorld Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2021 edition. In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.\n\nThe smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.\n\nThe taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.\n\nThe mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.\n\nOverall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2016 - Cerberus. Black wax.\n\nPoured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass.\nThick head of tiny dark tan bubbles that dissipated to a thin cap. No lacing left in the glass.\n\nAroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.\n\nTaste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!\n\nMouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.\n\nOverall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.\n\nImpressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.\n\nThick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.\n\nIt's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.\n\nThis is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev #100, yummy!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours darkness of course, dark tan head good lacing.\n\nAroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.\n\nTaste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.\n\nMouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.\n\nOverall amazing what can be done with just roasted malts none of the additives used in all the big dessert stouts now a days. One fabulous brew. Bought another bottle to bring home to share it was so good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Incredibly balanced for a burly 12% wonderful vanilla flavor and bourbon caramel flavors yum",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2020 bottle.Pours into a goblet jet black with a billowing deep mocha colored head that leaves a nice full ring of froth behind as it settles very slowly.Fig and caramel aromas up front then the deep chocolate and toffee really come thru,amazing on the nose.Flavors of cherry and fig hit the palate than the deep chocolate/fudge hits with a hefty roast but not big enough to over take the dark fruits and chocolate,booze in the back end.Wow great stuff,been holding it,it lived up to the billing for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours jet black in color with minimal head. Taste is baker's and milk chocolate, slight barrel and char with a touch of vanilla. Heavy body, roasty, slightly sweet, low carbonation. Based off of some of the variations, I was not expecting to like this as much as I do. No frills stout that tastes like beer, not dessert, not barrel...even though they are there, but beer. Very very impressive. One of the best stouts I have had in some time.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev OK Silver Wax Vampire from 2010. This beer is now 11 years old that I traded for some Cantillon so here goes.\nA - Well its still pours a thick oily colour with a big Beige head that retains so very well and laces\nS - Massive roasted malts with yeast extract like aromas. Wow, when I swirl the glass the aromas are massive.\nT - Well its not lost its flavour that is for sure ! The end is a lingering old Coffee flavour with a distinct Vanilla start that is very well balanced but slightly sticky sweet marshmallow\nM - Very very smooth with minimal Carbonation\nO - This beer has stood up to the test of time so very well. You can store these beers and still get a great experience as I did. In fact I would say that this beer is better than the fresh version",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Glad I finally picked this up... was reluctant to do so at $25, since it hit my &quot;$1/oz.&quot; personal threshold :-) \n\nAmazingly strong head and lacing... it just doesn't quit.\nAromas are not my favorite for the style... a slight chemical quality throwing off the otherwise pleasant butterscotch and roasted malt. \nFlavor is awesome ... great balance of creaminess, dark malt, sweetness, roast, etc. \nMouthfeel is insanely smooth for this ABV. Nothing astringent in the aftertaste.\nOverall a top-notch RIS, and everything I could've hoped for."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Christmas Holiday seasonal ale brewed by Tröegs that I get every year. Great balance in the Cherry and honey flavors.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.\nPoured from a bottle into a pint glass.\nLooks amber with a nice foamy head that lasted.\nSmells malty, cherry, sweet.\nTaste follows the nose nicely.\nMouth feel is medium for the style.\nOverall a very nice example of the style that I would definitely order again.\nCheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Read the description involving cherries, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. and heard that Troegs cut down on their supply this year due to low cherry supply- therefore I expected it to be very sweet and cherry forward. However, it comes off a typical belgian tripel. Very good, would prefer it over anything you could find in the grocery store.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks really good in a pint glass with it's reddish brown hue. I am not so good with sense of smell, but the taste is very good, I get the flavor of the cherries, could not really get too much honey flavor. The 11% does hit me, but I do prefer a high ABV and I definitely appreciate this Belgian style holiday ale! I always seem happy with products from Troeg's! The one time I was actually at Hershey park, near the Troeg's brewery, but I was not able to visit the brewery. At least their fine products are available near me!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Love this for the Holidays. The high ABV makes it special for me. Like DFH 120, it is definitely a sipper. Surprising, it is especially good with dinner. Last 6 pack at $18. was what I expected and will buy again next year.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Probably one of the least tasty beers I've had in my life. Sorry to say, I did not enjoy the Mad Elf and had to give the last two of the six pack to a friend... Who left it in his fridge for months and refused to drink the stuff.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Mad Elf has a thin, ivory head, a mostly clear, copper appearance, with fine flecks, throughout, and no lacing. The aroma is of strong brown bread crust, with faint cherry backing. The flavor is similar, with cherries showing up, as it warms. The drinker will notice low bitterness. The Mad Elf has a medium body, a somewhat chalky mouthfeel, and a semi-dry finish. \n\nRJT",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not much I can add that hasn't been covered in other reviews. The cherries and honey are well-balanced against the malt and alcohol. A very satisfying brew.\n\nOf note, a can that was a year old had a bit more sweetness and less alcohol bite, and was generally smoother. Wonderful just the same.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really great holiday beer. It, packs a punch, so just one with a nice heavy holiday meal is really ideal. Some fruity undertones. A really pleasant heavy hitter that needs to be respected. It was once 13%, but still packs quite a punch.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I thought this would be too heavy and sweet, or have too many odd flavors, but it does not. It just tastes good and it goes down easy. It’s been a few months so I’ll have to update next year on the taste. All I know is I miss it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Found this at my local supermarket with a buddy of mine whilst we were studying for some finals in college. Neither of us had heard of this beer, so we thought we'd give it a try with zero expectations. They were room temperature, which was (only was) a bit concerning. \n\nWe crack open our first bottle and boy was it pure magic. Both of us agreed right then and there that this was one of the best beers either of us had tasted. Perhaps the stress of the exams with being on an empty stomach stirred up the right conditions to love this beer on that night, but my feelings towards it haven't changed.\n\nAwesome beer, expect something very sweet and QUITE boozy",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a nice ruby red color. Very clear with a tight white head. The smell is of cherries and and sweetness. The taste is like the smell with a faint hint of chocolate and honey. Overall a good beer, especially on a cold winter night.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Poured a deep red with a thin cream-colored head.\n\nSmell: Cherries, honey, malt, wine. Hints of pine and cloves as well. Nice sweetness to the smell but you can tell it’s gonna be a boozy ride.\n\nTaste: Aggressive cherry flavor on the front with notes of honey and spices. Nice boozy finish with each sip as well. \n\nFeel: Medium bodied with a smooth finish, although I don’t think the alcohol is as well-hidden as some other reviewers have noted. However, I prefer my strong ales to be boozy anyway so I enjoyed the lack of subtlety.\n\nOverall this is a really good strong ale and perfect for the holidays.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Early entry from Troegs. Later efforts have very much surpassed this offering.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 'Tis the season to pour a 12 oz. can of this into a clear pint glass. It's a dark copper colored liquid that's more translucent than opaque. Almost no head was produced by the pour and no glass lacing is expected. A sweet fruity malt aroma dominants what the nose picks up. The taste is sweet and fruity, overwhelmed by a Belgian yeast flavour. The heavy dose of alcohol is more noticeable to the gullet than to the tongue and that’s a good job of disguising it. There's more carbonation on the tongue than the eyes would indicate awaited. It is what it is, a heavy hitting, sweetened and strong Belgian Ale. This should get better ratings by those that embrace the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I don't recall liking this much the last time I had it (4-5 years ago), but they had it at my local gas station. It's kind of hard to pass up the novelty of purchasing an 11% ABV Belgian ale at the same place people are buying their morning coffee and boner pills. Anyway...\n\nA minimal, doughy head froths up over a deep amber, almost reddish brew. Doesn't look like there's much carbonation going on, which bodes well. I don't want to stick my dick in it or anything, but it's pretty in the way that imperial red ales are pretty. Smell is sweet honey and cherry juice with something spicy going on as well; probably the typical clove-ish Belgian yeast thing. Taste is a little heavy on the cherries, to the point of being vaguely medicinal. The high alcohol content probably helps further those vibes. There is a pleasant Belgian strong ale base, but it's buried a bit. Feel is thick and almost syrupy. Also, despite there being little visible carbonation, it's still a little too effervescent. Meh... I've certainly had worse, but this tasting didn't change my opinion of this beer one iota. I'm sure some people with cherry-leaning sweet teeth dig it, but it's not for me."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured a clear rich amber with khaki head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had rich malt base with subtle yeast and nuttiness. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with robust malt with bread and nut presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look - great slightly dark brown with a nice tan head and lacing\nSmell - dark caramel nutty maltiness\nTaste - nutty malty slight caramel bread\nFeel - medium body and carb\nOverall - great but brown",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from ab12oz bottle.\nL- Dark brow but you can still se thought it held up to the light. Tan head of frothy bubbles, but not too fine. About 1 finger an dissapates into a ring and a few bubble islands.\n\nS- coffee notes with a dark sweetness and bitter hop notes that balance the malts. Almost herbal funky earthy qualities from the yeast \n\nT- taste follows the smell but is more mellow and creamy. Then it transforms into a roasty slightly bittered aftertaste, the malt and hops work together in this one very well, hops are very traditional. \n\nF- this one is definitely a before bed/winter warmer, very thick and hearty. Good with a big warm traditional steak and potato dinner or maybe a lasagna, comfort foods things like that. Has a nice nostalgic vibe.\n\nO- good to have a couple but not the most seasonable in the world compared to other British styles, but the flavor is very good and the quality shows. A very nice sipper.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Earthy, bold, highly flavorful, and unique. Tastes like I imagine beer would have tasted when knights in armor stomped this planet. There is an antiquity to the character of this beer, and it is not branding, it is real. A very large range of flavors, from slightly tart to sweet to coffee, cocoa powder, mineral, woodsy, smoky... and something indiscernible to my current vocabulary but extremely good. Creamy, silky feel. Lingering wonderful flavors. One of the best ever no doubt.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I poured the beer into an imperial pint nonic, a decent pour produces a nice fluffy off white brownish head, it sticks around for a bit and recedes to a thin cap that leaves a little lace with each sip. The color is medium dark brown and is somewhat translucent. The smell is all malt with a little roastyness, nothing grassy or herbal about it. The taste follows the nose, it's not sweet, but not bitter. I find the taste to be lacking in that ashy roasted barley that I find in other brown ales that I like. The feel is straight up medium body with maybe a little more carbonation than I care for, but seems right for the style. Overall, I like it and would revisit, but I have had better examples of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev No obvious date. Only marking I see is SA30T1, on the neck of the bottle. \nI've had this several times previous, just never reviewed it, somehow. \n\nClear chestnut brown, with slight redddish tint if held up to the light. Light tan head, that leaves a thin ring. \n\nSmell is light raisin+date, followed by a nutty (walnut?) aroma after the head fades. Slight, fresh, biscuity malt aroma appears when swirled. \n\nTaste is roasted nuts (walnut+pecan), brown bread, raisin, some hop spiciness, and a vague woody/earthy flavor. \n\nFeel is medium light, initially smooth , with light very,very fine, sharp carbonation bite coming in later. Suspect that this is fairly fresh, or that previous specimens were quite old, as I don't remember it being that sharp. (&amp; I like it better now) \n\nOverall, smooth, easy-drinking, and always a pleasure. Nice to revisit the old standards every now &amp; again.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1636\nNut Brown \nSamuel Smith\nDate: unknown\nI have consumed this beer several times; it surprised me to learn I have not reviewed it. The beer was 44 degrees, and I poured it into a pint glass. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head, a light tan head with good retention. The somewhat slow dissipation left a bit of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, mahogany color with ruby hues. When put to a light source, the beer has clarity. \n\nThe aromas in the beer are nutty, caramel, toffee, medium roasted malts, a touch of herbal, hint of floral, and malty sweetness. \n\nI taste nuttiness, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, bready, earthiness, a hint of floral, cereal grains, a touch of mineral, and malty sweetness. \n\nThe mouthfeel is creamy. \n\nThe body is medium, medium-low carbonation, and subtle finish. \n\nA classic nut brown ale with all the goodness to make you go back for more. I enjoy this beer and what this brewery produces. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 22 oz bottle bought with a three bottle gift pack. Enjoyed on the side porch while watching the chicks experience their first real grass! 9/19/21 Lovely malty, caramely aroma. Great mouthfeel and the taste is caramel, roast, and stone. I'm not a huge fan of this type, but this was fantastic!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Lovely orangey brown colour. Thick, brown-tinged, off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves thick bands of lacing. Toasty malts on the nose, hint of chocolate, caramel, and red wine. The taste is quite chocolatey, more chocolatey than nutty I think. The mouthfeel is rounded, refreshing, and not too sweet, very well balanced by the slight bitterness of the roasted malts and the gentle hint of earthy hops. Overall a solid English brown ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev My sampling was taken from a 4 pack of 16oz cans. I did a traditional easy pour at 45 degrees. The medium brown beer formed a light, cream head with larger bubbles in the foam than you’d find in most stouts. The foam formed tall calling for a pause to the pour to let it settle before pouring the rest.\n\nThe foam quickly settled to a thick lace around the parameter which lasted through to the bottom of the glass. The beer is warm brown with a slightly yellow appearance at the margin.\n\nThe smell is subtle of light wood and sweet caramel. Upon the first sip I tasted the sweetness like caramel with hints of hearty nuts (such as walnut, but not exactly) and earthy, root. The feel is medium thickness but not chewy. The low carbonation creates a consistent feel from the front to the back. Slight bitterness that fads quickly.\n\nOverall, this is a surprising refreshing brown ale without any stand-out negatives. This is a brown ale that any beer drinker can appreciate. My take away is that if I could pleasantly drink a tree (root, trunk and nut), then this would be it. Be one with a tree, try this beer if you can find it!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Small head, dissipate quickly. Medium carbonation. Dark brown color. Nice body, like creamy. Very pleasant malty flavors still something refreshing about it. I was not expecting to like whatever nut is in this but it subtle, quite good actually. Glad i have 3 more to drink, this is a winner !",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev With US market overfilled with pale ales that all taste alike (or not like pale ale at all), I like to go to a basics like this one. One thing about English Ale's in general- you know what to expect. The reason a lot of people deviated from US made pales, is because how much flavor has migrated from the release year in last 20 years for lots of iconic brands. Take Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, as a true presenter of the style and a true classic. It is nowhere near the flavor I remember from back in the day. Sam Smith takes me back in time, it was able to preserve the flavor, reminding me of those days when Beck's was German and Bass was English. And yes.....Harp was available everywhere.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reddish brown body with a quickly dissipating soapy beige head. Aroma is very malty and inviting; almond, walnut, freshly baked bread. A slight hoppiness. Taste is on the malty side which goes with the style. Very smooth and beautifully rounded out with flavors of malt and barley. Reminds me of the kind of beers I drank when I first got into beer, enjoying the malt profile."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I don’t know why it has taken me this many years to try this beer. It’s really darn good. Very much an American Stout with the piney PNW hopping and bitterness levels. SRM, head color and solid retention is practically perfect.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12oz bottle. \n\nOn the pour a nice head forms my pour was pretty gentle so it wasn't huge, but it was made up of fine light brown bubbles. It fades to a decent ring with some on top. It's pitch black with no light coming through. \n\nSmell is mostly roast with strong note of dark chocolate on top of a nice dark bread base with some earthy piney hops in the mix as well. It's a very pleasant aroma a bit heavy with some lightly fruity fermentation notes.\n\nTaste follows the nose, but with a big bitter hop bite on the front with the roast malts shining through right after. The hop bitterness lingers as the flavor evolves from the hop flavor to the malt roastiness. The fruity fermentation stick around a bit. In the stout it's like raisins or vague dark cherries but it isn't pronounced. Quite nice and very nuanced.\n\nFeel is quite heavy. One of those liquid bread beers and quite thick in the mouth as more head forms. Despite that it's easy to put down and quite smooth. Goes with a meaty meal or just a nice cold night with a good show.\n\nOverall despite being a standard stout at just above 6% it's got a big flavor without adjuncts. Very good what they did with hops water and malt here. Good job.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Black body with creamy brown head. Completely full body, impossible to see through. So nice looking. Aroma is of coffee and medium dark chocolate, some dark fruits as well along with a dash of earthy hops. Taste is superb, with rich chocolate textures and an espresso bitterness. The earthy hops provide a a nice dry balance. Mouthfeel is slightly milky with a mild chalky feel. This is a terrific example of a stout.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I have enjoyed this brew many times before, but never reviewed. Now is the time. A new hop to me, Delta. The malt profile promises rich creamy and sweet.\nAn impressive mousse caramel head with microbubbles forms straightaway. Appears nitro but is not. The liquid is black black as expected. Not super thick but enough for 6+ abv. Carbonation only seen when shaken.\nNose: Cocao, chocolate chip cookie, deep roasted coffee notes lingering. Dark and indulgent. Hop presences with malt. Cream. Comperable in smell to Old Rasputin.\nThe espresso notes are certainly there. It leaves the same aftertaste as biting a coffee bean. Excellent for those who enjoy. Pleasantly lighter than I expexted with a slight bite to balance the malt. There is residual booziness but when combined with the bitter espresso it works well. \nA sharp stout.\n\nAs a coffee lover this works for me. If you dislike, avoid Obsidian. The mouthfeel is lacking in fullness and action, but is made up for in taste and smell. For Deschutes, I think their Porter is a better option (but not fair, as it is one of the best.)",

Smell= taste: some bitterness, some dark chocolate, some roasted malts. Nice for something not barrel-aged. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thinnish side for my preferred stout experience.

This stout is way to dark to observe carbonation, After ten minutes the foam settled back to a thin layer with thick lacing left behind.\nThe aroma is sweet chocolate up front with light coffee in the background. \nThe flavor is just the opposite, with chocolate up front, but the taste is dominated by the dry, bitter coffee flavors. There is not a noticeable alcohol burn for me. The coffee flavors cut the sweetness very nicely.\nThere is a silky smooth feel, but not overly heavy. The carbonation feels light.\nFor me this stout was very enjoyable, but be ready for bitter coffee flavors.",

The scent is slightly over-hopped citrus and coffee, and the taste only enhances the citrus.... and keeps enhancing it as I drink. Over-carbonated going down, this is not the stout I was looking for.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very nice stout with coffee and dark malts up front. There is also some sweetness mixed in and a light bitter finish. It is an overall pleasant offering that is easy to enjoy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle packaged pretty recently.\nColour is black with white head. Looks like a good stout.\nSmells of roasted malt with coffee notes.\nThe taste of this is really interesting. It's cool how Deschutes stouts all have the same sort of malt character. Kinda reminds me of The Abyss. Roasted malt, coffee, and an interesting kind of spice at the end. Bitterness at the end from hops, very cool overall and really drinkable.\nThe feel is full bodied and nice.\nOverall, this stout is amazing for something that can be picked up for relatively cheap in 6 packs. Deschutes hits again",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This might be the first time i tried this beer.\nPoured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. Half-finger head when poured with good lacing on the glass.\nColor is black-brown- opaque.\nAroma is inviting; roasted maltiness, coffee, and a hint of chocolate.\nTaste of rich coffee, roasted malts, and some chocolate in the very back. There is a nice bitterness that permeates the palate while drinking this beer.\nMouthfeel is my favorite part- smooth and bitter at the same time like a 'black IPA'.\nOverall, this is a really satisfying beer; straight forward roastiness and coffee bitterness, little bit smooth, followed by a clean, crisp finish. \nI love everything I tried so far from Deschutes- there is a attention to detail and making beer that is satisfying from start to finish. Well done!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Opaque black, light brown head that dissipated quickly. \n\nSmell: Coffee, toasted malts, dark chocolate.\n\nTaste: Follows smell. Sort of sweet and malty in the mouth, far more of the coffee bitterness in the aftertaste.\n\nFeel: Normal body and carbonation, leaves a somewhat dry feel.\n\nOverall: Excellent stout!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice combination of flavors. Almost like a sipping beer to detect them all . Ideal for all seasons. I prefer it to the very similar Black Butte Porter also offered by Deschutes."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2013 in 2022. 8 plus years and zero signs of oxidation. Very dark brown. Nose has light cinnamon behind big bourbon. Super boozy, notes of chocolate and molasses. Big body and medium carbonation with tongue numbing alcohol. Dream ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!\nPoured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.\nThe aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)\nThe taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.\nThe feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.\nOA, Wow, really tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 09/13/21, 18.9% ABV. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little bit. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong. Some more age wouldn't hurt this brew at all. I thought this was a pretty good imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you're into big barrel aged imperial stouts!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle received in Bif13 from @colts9016\n\nBrewers Notes: Our infamous Black Tuesday is an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels for over a year.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours close to jet black, small cap of tan head that settles to a thin ring; streaks of ruby when held up to light. Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation.",

It’s truly perfect. The epitome of the craft. This is craft beer. More will come from this…I have the 2014+ vintages",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father. This is the beer of a faithful husband. This is the beer of a youthful grandpa. This is getting my top ratings. What a way to celebrate Father's Day 2021!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This one is THICCC! Very dark and a strong boozy smell. Initial punch of booze and toffee up front and finishes nicely. This is a big one so definitely not on to tackle on your own!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Completely unreal thick. Had a 2016 cellared for 4 years. Chocolate and bourbon and a boozy but smooth element. Torquey at almost 20%. All the elements of a world class stout with chocolate and vanilla and tobacco. A dessert",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I tried 2017 and 2020 versions of this beer. Both pretty amazing beers, this rating is for the 2020 version which I thought was a bit more crisp and diverse in it's taste.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Shared 12 fl. oz. bottle, kindly provided by abemorsten. ABV is 9.5%. Hazy orange colour, large white head. Strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous American hops. The flavour is indeed a &quot;palate wrecker&quot; - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. Extremely hoppy flavour, but still, in its own weird way, fairly &quot;well balanced&quot; - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. Grapefruit, resin / pine and spruce. Yes, it is a &quot;typically American double IPA&quot;, and I’ve &quot;seen it before&quot;- but still: Oh so GOOD! Halleluja!",

Booze is present but not overpowering. \n\nA delicious beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good solid imperial IPA. Not up there with the best, but nice and solid. In tap at Industry Public House on Leah's b-day weekend in Pittsburgh! Good ending for lunch!\n\nAdd: 7/29/20. Trip home from Lancaster after Joy and Andy's wedding. Yes.... It's a palate wrecker!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From notes 3/9/13: Pours clear golden amber producing 2 fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, off-white head that leaves streaks and webs of lace. Aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla, resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. Taste is hop forward resinous pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange pith and zest, backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. There is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. Starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. Aftertaste is resinous, oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, creamy, drying, oily and drawing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pleasantly surprised, as it is not as intense as I thought after reading the description. Hoppy for sure, but relatively smooth and slick. Some malt comes through the hop assault as well, making this a tasty beer. Cheers!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the 12 oz. bottle. Pours clear copper/gold color. Hop forward, boozy smell with hints of orange and pine. Malty bitter taste with hints of honey, grapefruit and pine. Bitter to the end. Pretty good but not my fave.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle - not really fresh (best by Aug 2017 - now November 2017) so I would like to try fresh b ut.... despite not fresh kept refrigerated and this was fantastic. Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with 1-2 finger head. Caramel malt with citrus/tropical fruit aroma. Taste is sweet citrus, pineapple with distinct pine flavour followed by a dank sticky bitterness coating the mouth. Bites you and then begs you to have more. Appropriately boozy. Great!\n\nRepeat visit as showed up in Edmonton July 2019 .... still great!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev So if you only Love in a beer is hops you can't really do too much better here cause this stops just short of a hop smoothie. I myself am a hops hunter so this is great. The look is about a 9 or 10 in srm in a clear glass in natural sunlight it is a 7. That's a little light since most DIPA is at least a 10. The smell is sweet and piny, nice and smooth with a nice thick forestry sting. The taste is pure hops. You can definitely feel the alcohol but you technically can't tast it cause of the power of the hops. The feel is heavy like a stout with a nice finish that reminds you of a morning coffee. Overall this is a Heavy DIPA that might be able to just get away within the fabled Triple IPA class. It begins and ends with the word Hops"

Very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on, as well as the very smooth finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rerate, 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger. I turned the bottle upside down before opening. Hazy yellow colour, small white head of poor retention. The aroma has notes of citrus, and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana. There are also some less pleasant hints of solvent. The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel. \n\nOriginal rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent. The aroma and flavour have some of the typical notes of a hefeweizen (banana and cloves), but this beer was far from the best h.w. I’ve had (and I love hefeweizens). Fizzy mouthfeel.",

Some faint pale malts, grains, and hints of citrus. Not much here. (3.00)\n\nFlavor: Flavor is mild too. It has mild pale malts upfront before a sour and grassy note in the middle, before some faint lemon citrus notes. Has a sour and leafy note that lingers. Only mildly sweet. Minimal yeast too. (3.25)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied, lower carbonation. Finishes with a slight sour note on the finish. (3.25)\n\nCompared to Stone Dayfall 6/13/21: Pours an identical color. Milder aromas/flavors. More sour lemongrass, Less orange, orange peel, bergamot flower, and jasmine. Winner: Dayfall\n\nto Blue Moon LightSky 7/12/21: Pours a darker color. Milder aromas/flavors. More pale/adjunct malts with a larger body. Less juicy orange.\n\nOverall: A pretty bland beer here. Even a disappointment for knowing what I was walking into. The appearance was the best part. Minimal aromas and flavors altogether. A mild sour note is really all I detect that lingers. People on here have described this as similar to Blue Moon, but I would think that Blue Moon would drink far superior. This was bland, sour, and flavorless. (Final Rating: 3.24)",

That being said, one of the best homemade shandys I’ve ever crafted was with Shock. 1/4th Newman’s Lemonade and 3/4th a glass of Shock and damn you got a good mix.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass, forming maybe a finger of tan head. Deep cola brown color. Smell is sweet/roasty oats. Taste is similar to the taste, just mostly roasty with some sweetness. Taste got a bit much after it warmed, wasn't a fan at all at that point. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's a very good, strong and sweet stout, with the heavier body and roasty characteristics you'd expect from a stout, magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. The hop, malt, roast and sweet flavors are well balanced, and overall, it's just all around an excellent beer.\n\nOn the newer brown label, the words &quot;Double Cream&quot; are larger than the rest of the name, so the two of us read that as &quot;doubly sweet stout&quot; rather than &quot;sweet double stout&quot;, which is what it actually is - a maltier, stronger version of a sweet stout. It's still a cream stout so of course it is sweet, but it's not dessert levels of sweetness, which is good, in my opinion.\n\nIn other words, a Cream Stout is a sweet stout, and a Double Stout is a stronger, maltier stout, so this Double Cream Stout is both of those put together. It makes sense in hindsight :)\n\nI've liked pretty much every beer I've tried from Bell's, although they're the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). When other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack, Bell's 6-packs were $17, so I normally never buy them.",

Mostly smooth coffee roast and creamed coffee. (4.00)\n\nFlavor: Moderate flavors of smooth milk chocolate, sweet cream, and creamed coffee. A soft body with a smooth finish. Some smoke off the end. (4.00)\n\nFeel: Medium bodied. Soft, and smooth. Moderate carbonation. (4.00)\n\nCompared to Bells Porter: Pours a similar color with a darker and larger head. Stronger aromas. More creamed coffee and cream. Less roasted black malt and roast.\n\nCompared to Founders' Porter 1/25/22: Pours a similar color with a slightly lighter colored head. Similar aromas. More smooth chocolate and cream. Slightly less airy coffee roast. Overall, similar. \n\nOverall: This is a pretty good sweet cream stout. It pours an gorgeous appearance. The flavors are primarily focused around creamed coffee and that's what this beer reminds me of. I'm not a milk or cream stout person, but this one might change my mind and could grow on me. (Final Rating: 4.02)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours black with a finger of off white head reducing to a thick cap; decent lacing. Nose is bitter coffee, herbal and earthy hops, and bakers chocolate. Taste follows suit. Fairly bitter, earthy, not much sweetness or cream. Mouthfeel is thin and watery which is to be expected of the ABV I suppose. Okay beer. Won’t seek it out further.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle served in a nonic glass. Packaged 09/24/2021. PRN 34794. \n\nAppearance: Very dark brown, with some ruby red highlights at the edges. Thin tan head with some persistent sheets of lacing noted. \n\nSmell: Sweet, roasted malt with some chocolate (cocoa powder, milk chocolate) notes. With a swirl, some coffee / espresso notes and just a bit of a metallic copper aroma. \n\nTaste: Well blended sweet malt, cream/lactose sugars, roasted malt, coffee-like bitterness, and a little bit of char bitterness with a hint of tobacco as well. \n\nMouthfeel: Certainly holds up to its name. It's nicely thick and creamy smooth. Light carbonation underneath it all. \n\nOverall / Drinkability: A very good stout, and went well with some chocolate covered pretzels. I think this would pair really well with a burger as a substitute for a milkshake. A bit of a sipping beer and I'm finding one is enough, but I would definitely get again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Poured black as strong coffee with a light tan head. Bubble foam lace on the glass.\nSmell and Taste: Cocoa and coffee notes. Sweet but no overpowering.\nFeel: Smooth going down but slightly watery.\nOverall: Could use a little kick in the ass with a higher ABV. Gosh, am I starting to should like an alcoholic? LOL",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pour is esthetically pleasing, no head with a nice straight pour to the bottom of a tullip glass. A nice lacing surrounds the outermost layer of the glass. Best enjoyed cold, but not ice cold. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, hazelnut, roasted malt, with less of a creamy taste but more of a creamy feel. This is the kind of beer that leaves you feeling warm, that snuggles the inside of your stomach. The earthy-ness brings in autumn vibes, a beer best enjoyed sitting next to a fire that’s fueled with oak wood. Not considerable dry. Overall a great dessert beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Virtually no head when poured on tap. What little foam there is, dissipates quickly. Smells and taste of coffee, slight vanilla, and spice. Bitterness level is just right. Nothing really stands out, pretty mediocre",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 08/17/2020. Sampled April 4, 2021.\n\nIt pours near black with a modest, diminishing tan head.\n\nThe aroma has a little chocolate and vanilla with a mild floral hop profile underneath.\n\nLight to medium mouthfeel. \n\nThe taste is also creamy and dark but the finish feels clean to me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Pours black as night in color with a bitchin, tall espresso head. \nS: Smells rich of coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, slight amount of coffee. \nT: Very much follows the nose, sweet dark fruit flaor. \nF: Low carbonation, full-bodied, silky, smooth. \nO: Not a bad brew, I'd just like it to be more roasted.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev a little too bitter for my taste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: Glistening highlights of Merlot outline a pour that was a rich chocolate color. A milky froth capping of one finger, was tan-hide in color, was short lived. Tiny effervesce bubbles slowly make their way though the darken experience in the vessel with a solid gold lace band encircling above like a halo. \n\nS: Creamy rich and milky chocolate character with some marshmallow highlights on the opening nose. Eloquent milky coffee roast is freshly grounded and straight to the glass. Dark chocolate is sweet along with some burnt caramel and cocoa. There's a bit of smokey sweet dark fruit about, cherries and plums in particular that mixes with some roasted pine and silty charred remains. When all is said and done everything blends beautifully together in a balanced way.\n\nT: The flavor was equally rich and rewarding, sweet vanilla and milky roast is very flavorful, along with some smoky wood highlights. Burnt molasses and caramel creamer add sweetness along with some dark fruit of plums and black cherries. There is some roasted pine hop leaves, milky lactose that blends well with the subtle smoky character and backbone. Wet silty ash hints are smooth as silk. \n\nM: Full bodied experience on the mouthful, very creamy, with a lot of depth. A softly carbonated presence with just the right amount of tingle for a big stout beer. Warm roasted warming on the hold. \n\nO: Overall a perfectly balanced brew, smooth and softly roasted sweet cream stout that is dessert in a glass with an exceptional drinkability. Sweet vanilla, rich coffee roastiness defines this drink, like a smooth Italian coffee. Huge creamy mouthful is the explanation point along with a lingering wet silty bitterness that begs for more sips. Poetry in a glass.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Pitch black in color, perhaps a faint ruby on the edges. Somewhat sized brown head with good retention and lacing.\n\nAroma: toasted/roasted grains and malts, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cream, lactose, burnt caramel, and toffee.\n\nTaste: I'm tasting the toasted/roasted grains and malts especially with some hop bite. Also tasting some more bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Because of this, the sweet notes mentioned in the aroma have more of a minor role, although I can still taste the lactose/milky notes somewhat well. Body is medium-light.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Serving: On tap at Brasil (Houston, TX) served in a shaker pint glass.\n\nAppearance: Relatively opaque, dark brown with ruddy tones. Pours with a short head of tan foam and leaves a few streaks of lace.\n\nSmell: Toasty roasted grains and hot chocolate.\n\nTaste: Less assertive roasted malt; coffee, chocolate and caramel. Leans a little sweet and boozy but remains restrained.\n\nMouthfeel: Medium body, creamy smooth feel and softer carbonation.\n\nOverall: A solid and drinkable, malt focussed stout. Went down well alongside morning coffee.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours like a syrupy coca cola. Not as fizzy. Very little head in my teku glass. Still practicing smelling - this one I get cold coffee - making me wonder if it would get better as I let it warm up, has been chilling in my very cold fridge. I'm also getting bitter dark chocolate in the smell. I can't wait to taste. Nice classic stout flavor. Not too bitter, some coffee flavors, as I let it rest on my tongue I get a slight numbing experience, only 6.1% abv though. The mouth feel is not as creamy, not as silky as I remember stouts to be, this one being my first in at least a couple years, but I feel like that makes it a bit more drinkable. I do want some water after, it's like a dessert in that way.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good - didn't really impress though."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2011 vintage opened on 1/3/20. Aggressive pour yielded Low carbonation. I poured it back and forth between pint glasses to get it to breathe a bit and roused 0.5 fingers of marshmallowy-thick dark brown head with great retention. Liquid is pitch black. Very good looking. Aroma is molasses and bourbon and cocoa, some vanilla and coffee. Decent aroma. Flavor is remarkably sound after 8-9 years in the cellar and 2 house moves. Only off note is slight cardboard in the aftertaste which knocks the enjoyment down a bit. Strong beer that got a lot mellower in time and is quite enjoyable!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 355ml bottle from Brewdog.com (£4.90):\nA jet black, opaque beer that's got a very fine, tan brown lacing on top but it quickly fades to a bubbly lacing around the circumference a few seconds later. The nose isn't quite as strong as you'd expect from an 11% beer but opens with dark malts, coffee &amp; an earthy bitterness as well as some alcohol &amp; touches of vanilla. The taste is stronger although the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden given the strength, there's plenty dark malts &amp; a few smoked flavours with earthy hops &amp; hints of caramel alongside some dark fruits sitting in the background. Its a full bodied beer with light carbonation &amp; a fairly thick, smooth feel that goes down well with a pleasantly warming feel to round things off; great stuff. ",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;No date or vintage on the bottle. Not a very big aroma as compared to other RIS that I have had in the past. On the taste I'm getting a fair amount of dark fruit notes but it's melded well together, some baker's chocolate, nice roast character on the finish. Yes, black licorice is a note that I can agree with on this beer. The 11% abv is well hidden, just a slight sting. I also agree that there is a good hop presence on the beer which I can care less for. It's a good RIS but it's not up there with the greats. Cheers! A-"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer pours a dark golden color, almost amber. Quite clear looking. The head is 2 finger, white, frothy, and fluffy looking. The head retention is quite good, and the head clings to the glass to form nice lacing as it dissipates. \nNose is quite minimal. I do get a faint hint of hops that makes me think of pine. \nUp front I get a nice malty biscuit flavor, slightly buttery. This biscuit doesn't last long, because the hops then kick in. They're not as strong as an IPA (of course), but they're there, and linger. The hops tend toward pine. There's also a slight earthy, grassy flavor here also. \nBody is crisp, but also full at the same time. \nOverall this is a quite delicious beer, and I'm glad we've got it locally now.",

Sweet bready malt. Good balance.\n\nSolid mouthfeel with semi-soft carbonation. Starts sweet from the malt but quickly transitions to the piney bitterness.\n\nA fine APA.

Excellent thick lacing.\nS: Caramel, papaya, flowers, white bread, malt.\nT: Peach, orange pith, papaya, caramel, dry mango, some breadiness, slightly dank subtle pine which lingers in the medium-long finish. There are notes of black tea flavoring within the finish as well that blend well with the pine.\nF: Very soft, creamy medium-bodied mouthfeel that is plush and has a delicate finish that is moderately long. It is gently tart and firmly dry.\nO: Lightly dank and fruity this Pale Ale is smooth and drinks quite nicely. A great compliment to many foods as it is not too sweet or aggressive with flavors. It is dry. An excellent beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Interesting beer in a category that doesn't always produce the most interesting tastes. It has a very cool orange color.

Bitter orange hop driven note is fairly mild. White bread yeast.\n\nTaste: Classic American Pale ale, malt has a light toasted taste, hops are fruity and bitter, high for a Pale ale but below IPA (XPA) levels. Balance goes slightly toward the bitter end, but fairly well balanced. Light tonic water finish encourages the next sip.\n\nMouthfeel: Gritty, medium carbonation, fairly dry finish.\n\nOverall: A fine pale ale. I've wanted to try this for a long time given the high scores this has gotten over the years. I can see this being a local favorite, but it's a Pale Ale. A hard style to get super excited about, but would be very happy if it was a regular offering down the street. It's just not exponentially better than a lot of other Pale ales I've had. Put it in a lineup and I'd have a hard time picking it out."

The whiskey wasn't very prevalent but it was there and it helps sometimes but if i want those flavors more I'd probably look elsewhere.

Splotchy wisp remains leaving touches of lacing down the glass as it empties.\n\nSMELL: Whisky, oak, and a level of tartness to it. Cacao and vanilla cream come out more as it sits, as does some roasted coffee aromas.\n\nTASTE: Whisky, oak, a touch of tartness, with some roasted coffee and then a dose of alcohol at the swallow. Bolder finish of wood, whisky, roasted coffee, some light tart character, hints of chocolate, as well as some decent alcohol linger on the palate.\n\nPALATE: Medium body with medium carbonation. A little foamy on the palate, goes down okay with a bit of a burn and finishes somewhat mouth-coating. A decent amount of heat lingers.\n\nOVERALL: Nope. No improvement. Perhaps this beer has gotten worse? In any case, this is mediocre at best. Not off-putting, but certainly not on-putting either. It might be slightly oxidized already, but if it isn’t, then it’s simply not that great. There’s a level of tartness to it that surely wasn’t planned, and the slightly foamy feel isn’t up to snuff either. I’ll finish the bottle, but am rather disappointed with this one. Here’s hoping that the other variants of 2019 turned out better."

Retention is average leaving a thin island of foam.\nThe intensity of aroma is low. There are notes of fruit, some funk, and oak. Also, there's a dirty diaper smell. It smells like a disposable diaper that's full of baby shit. How unfortunate. I hope it fades and fast. \nThe intensity of taste is medium-high. The taste has berries, oak, and is super tart. There's a strong wine quality. The shit filled diaper smell comes and goes. I find myself taking a whiff before each sip to make sure the coast is clear of dirty diapers.\nThe feel is medium in thickness. It's slightly syrupy, has almost no carbonation, and a medium astringency.\nOverall, besides the dirty diaper smell, it's far too tart for my taste. With the shit filled diaper smell, it's appropriately ranked #2.",

There are also reddish tints on the edges as you hold this up to light. What a gorgeous beer.\n\nThe first thing I notice on the nose is caramel notes, which bodes well for me (I LOVE caramel). There’s loads of funky, fruity sour aromas, of course, and I was searching for oak notes but alas, I didn’t find them.\n\nThe taste is as described on the bomber, with tart apples and sour cherries flavors in abundance and the caramel and a hint of vanilla from the oak at the end of the taste. \n\nThe mouthfeel is on the verge of puckerville, but backs away at the end. This is a truly magnificent sour, IMHO, because it’s not just sour - there’s depth to this world-class beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev October 25th, 2015 - This ancient brew is coming out of storage for a special occasion. 2007 marks the year of my college graduation and isn't far from my first bottle of La Folie, but we also acknowledge that like my body, the beer has probably aged terribly in eight years, and we are prepared for its flaws. On the nose I smell Bragg's apple cider vinegar, white grape juice and a little cinnamon. The lighter vinegar smell reminds me of sushi rice, as does the ginger note. After that comes some pear juice to round out the aroma, all of which is rich and beautiful. And to my surprise the flavor has matured beautifully too. I taste white balsamic vinegar, dancing in recision with white grape and a berry medley, and supported with a carbonation that hasn't managed to escape from the bottle in the intervening years. My drinking buddy could use more bubbles and a palate, but I find it acceptable, and spent the rest of my time ignoring my notes and enjoying the beer in a quiet bliss."

Has a dry, earthy finish.\n\nTaste:\nA robust burst of dark chocolate syrup, followed closely by smoked oats. The midpoint exhibits spicy Arabic coffee with a sprinkling of shaved cocoa nibs stirred in.

Not much actual bourbon aroma, but there is just enough to hint at the barrel aging. Very nice and inviting\n\nThe flavor is toasty and lightly bready with some fruity notes. Banana, apricot, coconut, and vanilla complimented by a peppery spiciness, and a sharp finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated.\n\nOverall this is a nice beer and coming in at a big 10.2% you would expect more booziness, but the alcohol is well masked, making this beer easy to drink.

Light tastes of banana, malt, and hops. Medium bitterness and heat like white pepper or cloves. This gives way to a sweetness and oak most likely from the bourbon barrels. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. The booziness becomes pronounced halfway through the drink. This beer started out on a bit of a ho hum with me and then really grabbed me.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2014 bottle, courtesy of my friend Jason. Poured into a Duvel tulip. \n\nL: Crystal clear medium amber body. The head is two fingers of fine white foam that leaves ample lace and replenishes itself with a swirl. Attractive. \n\nS: Very complex, with some vintage qualities (sherry especially) alongside the core components I remember from drinking this regularly on draft a decade or more ago: banana, apple, coconut, vanilla, and white pepper. Any actual bourbon aroma has long since faded, but the sweet accompaniments remain. Very nice. \n\nT: Opens with some bready malt ahead of the complex layers of fruitiness - banana and apple are joined by a strong melon note - followed by a touch of spice ahead of a rather boozy, dry finish. Lots of ethanol on the swallow, sadly overshadowing the great flavors that started things off. Not unexpected or particularly blameworthy in an 11% pale beer, but out of balance with the rest of the profile. \n\nF: Medium-bodied and full of soft, velvety effervescence. Perfect for the style. \n\nO: I love everything about this beer except its booziness, which I recall being the one thing I disliked about it back in the day. Even seven years conditioning in the bottle hasn’t fully tamed it, but it’s certainly held up admirably. I knew it wasn’t fresh when I opened it, but was shocked at just how old it was. Excellent beer overall, but nowhere near my favorite from this fantastic brewery. \n\nBeers of Fame tick #208. \n\nCheers!",

Subtle hops, I don’t consider this to be bitter at all until the very finish. Rounded whisky and sweetness throughout. \n\nF: On the heavier side of medium bodied for the style. Strong alcohol, relatively smooth overall, slightly dry finish. \n\nO: A respectable triple from Allagash. The bourbon cask compliments it nicely. Seems more like a one and done beer to me.

The maltiness that accompanied the bourbon was rather pedestrian.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by 3/2022\n\nYou know, as stupid as it may sound, this was one of the first beers I searched for when I began drinking underage. Me and my friends lusted after it but were never able to secure it. Flash forward years later, and I find singles of it at my local store. For the hell of it, I picked one up just to see for myself what I was missing years ago (probably not much)\n\nPours a cloudy gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nOh man, the cherry here is super artificial in the nose, very candy-like. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry jolly rancher, lime juice, crackery malt, earthy wheat, and light honey\n\nWhile the aroma was definitely candy forward, it also promised a fruity tartness. The taste is a huge letdown in the wake of this, not very good at all. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, cracker, sweet honey, and lemon rind. The swallow takes a nose dive in quality, bringing notes of cherry cough syrup, doughy malt, earthy wheat, and sticky seeet honey\n\nA promising start of a light body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a refreshing beer. But it finishes sad and sticky, just way too sweet\n\nOk so it’s not the worst thing in the world, but it’s pretty amusing to see what younger me was missing. Not worth repeating",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Mostly pale in color, was definitely expecting a hue more representative of a cherry. Lots of cherry on the nose, more artificial though, really similar to a cherry 7up. Taste followed the nose with a hint of a wheat backbone. Crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Not terrible, but nothing groundbreaking. Decent overall.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev With a bright golden complexion and refreshing appearance, the Sam Adams Cherry Wheat is wonderful summertime option. I took this along on a midmorning hike over Labor Day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed this sweet and light beer in the woods. Immediately, your nose is hit with cherry, fruity and bread like aromas. Following into a sip and a pleasant candy-like cherry flavor plays with you taste buds. There is an almost dry finish to it and at the end you're not really itching for another. A sweet fun change up, but once in awhile. Not really a go to for me, but enjoyed the experience.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a clear, medium golden color with a soft white head. SRM of 7. (3.50)\n\nAroma: Strong and intense aromas of sweet cherry upfront. There's sweet and candied cherry and faint syrup. Some bread, cream, and hints of vanilla through the end. (3.50)\n\nFlavor: The flavor follows with more candied cherry. This is followed by a bready and soft wheat malt. Finishes creamy to clean off the cherry sweetness. (3.50)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate to stronger carbonation. Finishes soft and clean on the palate. (4.00)\n\nCompared to Castle Danger's Castle Cream Ale 5/27/21: Pours a more golden color. Stronger aromas/flavors. Much more cherry obviously. Less cream and malt liquor flavor. \n\nOverall: I wasn't sure what to expect of this one because some said the cherry was mild, while others found it overpowering. Whoever said the cherry was overpowering was right. The cherry is strong here. Lots of candied cherry. Smells like a cherry Blow-Pop and tastes sort of like cherry pie. (Final Rating: 3.50)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Wheat and cherries on the nose. Taste follows suit with bread and malt coming first and cherries on the backend. Has a nice malty feel to it that adds a lot to my enjoyment of it. Good beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Got a 6-pack at the local packy. A bit of a murky look. Large head when first poured. Nice flavor of cherries.

Will be enjoying the rest over the next few weeks for a relaxing weekend evening. Would definitely get again.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I believe that a good beer doesn't have to be the best tasting, smelling, or looking beer. A good beer just needs to be able to remind me of a great nostalgic moment in my life. Sam Adams Cherry Wheat has a very specific and welcoming feeling when I drink it. The Cherry flavor is not strong but the wheat aspect has always thrown me for a loop as kinda odd tasting. But it reminds me of walking through WDW Epcot Food and Wine Festival as always being able to expect this beer waiting. Come to think of it, this might have been my first fruity beer. No one before then had shown me a world beyond BUD and Miller. Now I see the light..."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Let me preface this with - I don’t like pale ales very often. While cruising down my very small town Walmart aisle, I saw this and took a chance. Good decision. Lovely, citrusy grapefruit and piney tastes, golden honey color, hoppy, sweet, almost sunshiney smell. Head was just wispy trails poured in a Pilsner glass. Nice sharp carbonation. Want also to point out that my label is different with a 420 Highway type sign being the prominent part of the label (small fish under Sweetwater logo) and and an ABV of 5.7%. I like this very much.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev SweetWater Extra Pale Ale poured into a SweetWater pint glass. A slightly hazy golden ale, very light carbonation, with a one inch pillow of pure white foam. The foam lasted several minutes leaving very thick lacing left behind.\nThe aroma is light malt and citrus hops, these are very noticeable.\nThe flavor is sweet, maybe honey, light citrus, mildly bitter, crisp finish. There is a light pine note at the finish also.\nThis is a bit thin feeling, making it very for a session type setting of liquid miles.\nThis is an easy drinker, very refreshing after spending the last few hours cutting wood in the heat. Thumbs up to my first SweetWater brew."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle (no date, but I was told it was from 2021) served in a Libby globe porter glass.\n\nAppearance: Clear purple-red-amber color. Thin off-white/pink ring of foam with an occasional island of lacing. \n\nSmell: Raspberry, with a tiny bit of sour tang to it. \n\nTaste: Nice tart rapspberry tempered with some sweetness, and a lingering fruity bitter/tart finish. Very nice!\n\nMouthfeel: Slick, a bit sticky, good carbonation. Dry finish. \n\nOverall / Drinkability: This really is a great raspberry beer. I'd easily say this is a raspberry lambic, and a very well balanced one. Easily drinkable and I could pair this with a variety of desserts. I'm a bit surprised it's listed as a &quot;Fruit and Field&quot; beer given the character and the way the brewers make it. Well done and I definitely would want another.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev All the sweetness and tartness you could possibly ask for in a fruited beer. New Glarus usually nails it, but their line up of fruit beers are totally our of this world good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a 12oz. bottle poured into my stemmed New Glarus glass. This beer, pours a dark red wine look with an inch and a half of raspberry colored foam that slowly settled back to a thin pink cap. When held up to the light, heavy amounts of carbonation can be observed.\nThe aroma is sweet raspberry jam.\nTart is the perfect description! There is tart raspberries with a sweet bubbly and tart again finish. The carbonation plays a big part in the taste and mouth feel.\nThis is not what I expect or crave from a beer. The taste is pleasant though.",

Small wet head that quickly disappears leaving nothing but a few stray bubbles. \n\nNose has some sweet and tart of the raspberries that honestly kind of reminds me of marinara sauce. Ultimately beyond that there's deep aged berry aroma, like a raspberry wine. \n\nOooh man. Honestly, that's fucking delicious. It is raspberry juice. It is what it is. But I love raspberries. Late season berries, deep red, cool, just a touch of bramble tart. Jammy and delicious.\n\nModerate body I suppose, with a dry finish in contrast to the jammy berry carrying tool, and spicy/sharp/compressed carbonation. \n\nI'll be honest. I love raspberry. And that strongly colours my review here. But that's an important component of it. New Glarus is really good at what they do. This beer is yet another NG brew that is blatantly competently composed, and in this case (as opposed to some of the other NG brews I've been fortunate enough to try), that happens to also align with a fruit expression that is right up my alley. This is easily my favourite of the New Glarus fruit beers I've tried, and now I'm sad I only have the one bottle.\n\nThanks Frank for sending it my direction! Cheers!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a beautiful ruby red with a head that dissipates very quickly. It smells very intensely of fresh raspberries, you can smell it as you pour it it's so strong. The taste is truly incredible. It's like drinking fresh raspberry juice that's slightly tart enough to keep it from being too sweet. It's finely carbonated and perfectly coats your mouth with a very pleasant layer of bubbles. Overall it's the best fruit beer I've ever had and one of the best beers I've ever had. I hope new glarus keeps this one around for a long time. Truly awesome beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great balance of sweet &amp; acidic, bursting with jammy raspberries and finishing with a refreshing pucker. First ever New Glarus beer, and it’s got me excited to try more.",

Aroma is toasted malt, sugary caramel, yeast and a burnt hint with a thin hop character. Taste is malty toast with a hint of char, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, cream and yeast backed by a hoppy bitterness.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is somehow mostly just a sweet boozy mess even tho its 7 percent. I poured into a tulip glass. Not much malt, oats, or chocolate just a sweet alcohol flavor encased in and M&amp;M style malt shell....although I see this is under Russian imperial which does make more sense, I think this is firmly okay but not great for Russian Imperials. It's sweet, a little malt, a little smoke, but things like Expedition Stout or Narwhal are just better to me but this is getting more balanced as I drink just not spectacular.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nLacquered black, showing glimpses of brown where the light leans into it. It’s topped with a half finger of dark beige fizz that disperses faster than squirrels before a feisty, jack russel. Despite this, it retains a length of drizzly lace until the glass is practically empty.\n\nBouquet:\nPlump figs that were lightly sugared, then rolled in milk chocolate cocoa powder. The after-aroma is intermittent but impressively gourmet: roasted plums brushed with woodsy molasses and given a hearty dunk in black chocolate.\n\nFeel:\nA satin-soft full body, simmering with moderate carbonation. Dry, bittersweet linger.\n\nTaste:\nDark malts and oats, browned in a drizzle of maple syrup. Finishes with a spoonful of earthy, dark chocolate pudding.",

Let's rectify that straight away, kids. This stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, pumpernickel, and a touch of orange pith embedded into the background. The taste brings in more of the same, a pinch or two of cocoa powder rounding things out. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.

Flavor is dark toasted malt, dry caramel, baker's chocolate, dried dark fruit, dark molasses develops light grassy hop bitterness and finishes dry and a little earthy. Medium bodied with light creaminess. The Samuel Smith porters and stouts have a distinct flavor profile that incorporates fruit flavors that are almost concentrated. Great to revisit one of the classic Russian imperial stouts, one of the iconic products in brewing history. Great fruit notes and some of the most intense molasses characters I recall. The finish is a bit drier than I remember, but that's likely due to all the domestic RIS I've had, which have morphed from the original historical recipes. A delicious dark stout from a great brewery.",

Distinctive in flavor because of the creaminess and tang, but very drinkable and flavorful.",

There are definitely some little flakes of sediment floating around and there and settling into the bottom of the glass. Smell is nice, clear piny grassy hoppy notes and a definite malty/grain sweetness.\n\nTaste is pretty much what a pale ale ought to be. Moderate grainy sweetness, a tiny bit of a tea like characteristic, maybe the slightest nuttiness or toffee to spice things up a little bit, medium but building pine bitter finish.\n\nMouthfeel is medium-light with a very dry finish.

A Pacific Northwest cult classic and continues to be unwavering in its presentation – citrus and floral hops, good bready malt presence, clean, and ridiculously quaffable.

I’d drink it anytime, but I wouldn’t choose it over less malty pale ales, like a hip hazy pale ale. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true. I want super dry hopped goodness these days.

No idea why.\n\nPours slightly hazed and light amber with moderate head, decent retention and spectacular lacing.\n\nWell balanced caramel malt and earthy/grassy hop on the nose.\n\nThe brew hits the tip of the tongue with solid caramel malts, but they aren't overly sweet. Both fruity and earthy hops balance it well, but not aggressively so. Classic APA. Malts, but not too much. Hops, but with restraint. Flavor, but not in your face.\n\nThe brew could maybe use some more carbonation. It isn't heavy, but it is at least medium-bodied.\n\nIt is rare that a brew tastes and smells this good, but comes off this odd in the appearance and feel department. If it had one or two shades brighter color and just a bit more effervescence, this would be the paragon of the style. Still, even though it doesn't look or feel quite like an APA, the flavor is top notch."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 375 ml bottle. Dated August 27, 2020.\n\nPours a lightly cloudy bright golden color with a small white cap. Modest retention. Leaves a few legs of lacing along the glass as the head dissipates.\n\nStrong aromas of barnyard funk, white wine vinegar, pears, stone fruit and citrus zest. Lighter notes of oak, grass, green apple, and vanilla. \n\nThe taste has a lot of white wine grape and pears, as well as green apple, apricot, lemon, yeast and lime zest. There's also plenty of oak and vanilla. Subtly grassy and tannic. Tart, but not overly so. \n\nThe feel is light and extremely effervescent. Crisp. Exceptionally dry on the finish.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic beer. It's wonderfully complex yet very drinkable. This is not a style I'm an expert on, but I know a great beer when I have one and this one is truly great.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;been meaning to try this for a long time but it is tricky to find in dublin, found myself in an off license on baggot street yesterday and picked it up, bottled june 2020, a cloudy honey colour beer with a smattering of white bubbles on top, aroma is funk forward, tart, leathery, goaty, acidic, sweet, caramel, honey, pear, apple, rhubarb, lime, smells gorgeous frankly, taste is sweeter than other gueuzes i’ve tried, but totally delicious, the balance between the funky sour flavours, the acidic wooden flavours and the sweetness is perfect, rhubarb, cherry, pear, honeycomb, vanilla, oak, white wine, leathery, floral, feint hint of bitterness on the finish, beer is light to medium bodied with light carbonation, dry, puckering sourness, very drinkable, all in all a damn good beer that lives up to its reputation",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 375 ml corked bottle. Large head, disappears rapidly. Deep golden colour, cloudy when the yeast is poured. Heavenly aroma of barnyard and ensilage with white wine vinegar elements. Flavour is crisp and very dry, reminiscent of a very dry white wine or brut champagne. Not as complex as I expected. Really a beer for the &quot;Champagne Brut&quot; people.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L:. Pours a bubbly brilliant clear straw gold, the head lingers for a while and dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing.\n\nS: The dry yeasty funk hits the nose first and is very inviting, followed by notes of peach and light citrus fruit, followed by a nice nutty bread in the end.\n\nT:. Yeasty, funky and dry, peachy and white wine grape, with notes of pear, a dry bitterness. Everything is very harmonious and creates an amazing beer.\n\nF:. Light body, and very easy drinking.\n\nO:. This beer is definitely world class",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 2018 vintage, 33cl bottle with a picture of a little statue cherub holding a glass in one hand and the other hand is covering his genitals.\n\nThe pour is lightly fizzy, deep orange with a wisp of a white head. \n\nSmells wonderfully like a cross between a clean-but-musty garden shed and heaps of jarred fruit, like something tended to with such intense care that it makes you warm to so much as think about it. Incredibly complex, like a living being, without anything off or too intense. Seriously one of the very best beer aromas I've come across in my 16+ years of reviewing beer.\n\nThe flavor is wonderful but not quite at the level of the aroma. Very dry and earthy yeast and bacteria start things off, not tart in the least but with the same kind of quenching bitterness I associate with the finish of a very sour candy. This dominates the first sip, but after my pallet adjusts I detect excellent fruit complexities near the middle, smoothed out wonderfully by woody tannins, finishing on the aforementioned deep dryness of ash and microbes.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Favorite beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev So incredibly well balanced among acidity, funk, creaminess, and bitterness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing beer. Cantillon always knocks it out of the park. Lambics are great in general, but theirs are the best. More easy drinking than some Lambics. Love it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled with a cap and a cork \nI don’t care if it’s the wrong glass, fill it up.\nI’m 50 percent Blues Brother &amp; 50% Sleaze Brother. \nPours a slightly hazy golden body with decent white head acid drops and good wine vinegar \nAroma is malt vinegar that the Flavour is \nSlightly oily mouthfeel that I really like",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 375ml bottled 2 March 2015\n\nA: Tangerine shade in appearance with an amber hue, and golden highlights. The head is light in formation, and quick to fade in retention, with middling legs on presently aged/submissive carbonation\n\nS: A motivated aroma by raw garden funk in cellared pears, citrus limetta, perished apricots, and stained yellow peaches that are backed by a musty cobwebbed satchel before the lactic saddlecloth. The backing in barnyard continues on vinous white grape, crisp apple skins, and blemished basement gooseberries. A nicely seasoned aroma that offers tart floral esters to a crisped oak breadiness in malt profiling\n\nT: Wild strains of bacterial gardens on palate, where traction is played underneath rustic, untamed hay and wooded pine saloons. A vintage that steers to earth bound grains while building on dusted, tannic mahogany in oak-aged vinegar. The advances in development are indicative to herbed gorgonzola, and spoiled (tart) lemon curd, which begin to soften in peppery resin and open to a rosy powdery mildew\n\nM: The feel has calmed a bit on bright effervesce for a more dry potency, given eased acidity and smooth viscosity in time/aeration. A body that baits importance across apt carbonation, and leans on ashy citrus as it approaches a more disciplined dry ending\n\nO: The longevity offers balance, and appropriate timing, in offbeat (fragile) complexities"

Bad for any style, but an awful misfire of a lager. I'll try to snag another batch to confirm, but this was awful.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A- This pours a dark amber/golden color, and shows off generally clear....perhaps with some mild chill hazing. There is multiple steady streams of fizz rising in slow but uniform manner, maintaining a base layer of foamy head. This, by the way is about one and a half fingers in thickness to begin with, before the eggshell colored foam slowly dissipates into a clumpy thin/thick covering over the lager. The lacing is quite sticky too, with a thick film coating the inside of my glass....a very nice looking lager beer indeed!\n\nS- I detect a well balanced blend of caramel sweet malted barley, and the robustness of the Vienna style lager here shines, alongside a mild, yet distinct hop cone bitterness. Floral petals, muted piney notes, grassy dry grain, whole grain mountain bread and on the finish, an ever gentle peppery leafy spice.\n\nT- Now this is a tasty lager! Flavors follow the aforementioned aromas quite closely, with piney nuances balanced out by toffee/caramel sweet malts....these also showcase some toasty quality and there is a dry biscuit graininess on the palate too. Slight pepper spice, and a bread yeast flavor that lingers after the swallow. A very decent flavorful lager!\n\nM/O- Light and crisp in body, with perhaps a slight leaning into medium bodied territory. The carbonation is smooth yet fizzy enough to allow the full flavors to explode on the palate. I find the drinkability factor to be high and would have no issues enjoying this throughout an evening. It is a very tasty lager and in my opinion, one of the best that I have had! Excellent fare!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz can. Can bottom is stamped 'BB 07/2021'.\nClear, medium amber colored body.

The spice, malts, and hops trail off together in the aftertaste.\nThinner than medium mouth feel, with a creamy texture. Very good carbonation.\nAll components are positively expressed in this brew. Refreshing and somewhat crisp. Would be a very good choice for pairing with spicy or savory foods. Very handsome in its presentation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev De color ámbar, con una pequeña espuma blanca de retención media. Cuerpo ligero y carbonatación media. Aroma a malta tostada y lúpulo. Sabor levemente amargo pero aparecen notas de toffee. Muy agradable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;A very nice lager if you like sam Adam and looking something with a little more body and flavor this is it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Surprised I have not had this one yet.\nBBD of 5/2021. \nInto White Elm Willie Beecher. \n\nHas a copper orange body - looks like this is a vienna lager or an amber lager - with a butter colored head of 1 finger. Moderate haze, moderate clarity. Lots of webbed lacing. \n\nAromas of hop spoilage and strawberry, with some caramel malt and onion skin. \n\nFlavor is your typical amber lager but is crisper and more defined. I would say this is a stronger effort than SA's Boston Lager by a mile, and most any other &quot;micro macro&quot; amber lager you can get (New Belgium, Yuengling, Naragansett, Sierra Nevada, etc). Has a distinct toasted malt flavor with some underlying fruity esters (strawberry, lemon, orange) with a nip of pine on the finish. Unfortunately this one has fallen to hop spoilage as well, so it's not quite as enjoyable. This was partially my fault as it is nearing the end of its shelf life. \n\nFeel is crisp and tight, very busy with carbonation, exciting and poppy like an Amber lager should be. Drying, crisp finish. No sign of alcohol. \n\nOverall, a decent Amber that I'd be willing to try a fresh can of. It's not going to blow your mind of course, but will do just fine at a sporting event, casino, bar, or bowling alley. Recommended. \n\nPrice paid : $1.39 / can",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice size white head over a clear, bright amber body. Muted, moderately sweet, floral aroma. Crisp, clean taste courtesy of the carbonation. Free of the adjuncts that ruin many mass produced lagers. Decently balanced; not overly hoppy or bitter nor excessively malty. Caramel more noticeable in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with an average length finish."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This Ale is very easy to drink and has a wonderful malty-nutty flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I rated this 4 because I rated it a 4 on Untappd (so sue me,ok). It's a good, crushable beer. The description says they leave some yeast in it. The one I just had has more rustic/barnyard funk to it than the others of this I have had I suppose becsuse of the bottle conditioning. I never really have thought of this as a farmhouse ale, even though that's what Dan Carey calls it. It's a good beer, but certainly NOT the best beer New Glarus does. My overall issue with this beer is that with as many good beers as New Glarus does do, this one is the most ubiquitous. It's EVERYWHERE in Wisconsin. There are more beers I would rather have from them if Spotted Cow wasn't taking up so much shelf space.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Looks slightly cloudy light gold, medium loose white head. \nHas an average aroma of malt and mineral water, No funk or barnyard you expect from saisons. \nTastes like a kolsch, slightly malt forward, very average beer. They state on the can that they use German ale yeast, not sure how they can expect it to magically turn into a saison. \nIt’s not bad tasting, just not anything resembling a farm house style ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Like many others have said, you wouldn’t know this was a saison if the bottle/can didn’t tell you. Rides heavily on its desirability by being Wisconsin only, but if this brew was nationally available it wouldn’t catch anyone’s attention. Not to say it’s a bad beer, just tastes very cheap and generic. Would say the best comparison would be a maltier version of Bud Light, and if that sounds like an insult, it’s because it is; such an insanely underwhelming brew. Hundreds, if not thousands, of better craft beers in Wisconsin, and especially at the price New Glarus wants for their mediocrity, this shouldn’t even be considered by anyone who doesn’t live in Wisconsin or isn’t there regularly. If you do though, and you like it, then why are you even here? You’ve obviously tried it before. But if you haven’t, and you’re only in Wisconsin for a short time and want to make the most of it, don’t waste your time with Spotted Cow.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev draught\nSlightly murky, medium orange in the middle, to light yellow gold, at the edge of glass. Mild, malted yeast/grain aroma. Rather faint, very light toasted malt flavor, with only the slightest hint of floral hops. Quite thin and finishes like a mass produced domestic lager.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It’s a great “light beer”... it’s something worth grabbing for your summer cook-outs or sipping on your back porch... it’s “Wisconsin Only” makes it more desired than most Wisconsin want it... their are way better beers crafted in Wisconsin than this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On draft in WI and from 12oz bottles poured into a 16oz pint glass.\nL: Pours a lightly hazed pale gold with a thickly centered fluffy white head. There is some lacing on the glass and it has medium low carbonation.\nS: Wild flowers, sweet bread malt, honey, grains.\nT: Light grain, grass, bread, malt. Subtle sour notes, yeast, red apple peel, banana, dried peach and apricot.\nF: Lightly crisp, clean, light-bodied mouthfeel that has a very smooth texture and a fast, clean finish but is non-drying. Nothing lingers.\nO: This Farmhouse Ale has an exquisite balance of sweet/tart/sour/malt/yeast and drinks easily. It is positively quenching and has a &quot;natural&quot; kind of feel in it's overall profile. It is excellent.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a can. Pour has a slight off-white foam head that lingers even as it dissolves down. Body has a pale golden color with just a touch of haze present. Scent is a touch on the sour side, but not sour in the way a sour ale is but more so like a bit of cream or yogurt that lacks flavoring. Taste comes across as a more interesting form of lighter beers with some yeasty sensations bouncing on the tongue providing a bit of depth. The feel is on the creamy side, so not crisp/refreshing as a light beer would would again providing needed depth to make this an interesting offering. Never boring but never quite thrilling either; a solid offering to enjoy for all times.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I love farmhouse ales. And was looking forward to thus one. But after smelling it and tasting it, I had to look at the can to verify it was actually a farmhouse ale. Very subtle taste and smell. Good beer, but not as a saison.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Moooooo.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I think the style change makes sense as this is funky at the finish, it wasn't for me but I'm drinking this in Colorado because a coworker acquired some cases and I was given one to try, so cheers for that! That being said not bad at all and overall decent but this one isn't for me, I like Colette and Tank 7 more.\n\n\nUpdate: the second can was way better to me and more familiar so I changed the rating"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1608\nDamnation\nRussian River Brewing\nDate: 08 May 2020\nDrinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance. \n\nThe aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness. \n\nI taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness.\n\nThe mouthfeel is dry and spicy. \n\nThe body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish. \n\nI was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 5/27/20.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I should issue a caveat. The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment. \nIt is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry.\nThe yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.\n\nBecause Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Uncaged and uncorked this pour produces an exceptional foamy white head on top of an opaque dirty lemon yellow body. Head lasts indefinitely. Nose is citrusy and yeasty, lots of esters. Taste follows with an almost dry spicy finish. Reminiscent of many pale Belgian brews.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Another great Beer by Russian River!\n*Looks: Classic-Strong Belgian ale appearance, pale amber colored, semi-opaque\n*Aroma: Mild malt, pilsner, mild bread/yeasty \n*Taste: This a well-made, damn good Belgian Style Ale! Honestly if this were a blind tasting, I wouldn’t know the difference alongside La Fin Du Monde, Dūvel, Chimay, Westmalle etc.\n*Finish: mildly warm at 7.5% abv, easy on palate but slightly, only slightly heavy.\n*Overall Verdict*: Beautiful, artistically crafted, strong Belgian Ale by Russian River. Super work of art if you like Belgian style!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Has a decent head, beautiful hazy, Golden, effervescent look. Smell, a tad metallic, Typical yeast odor, not much smell at all. First touch in tongue yields mild bitter reaction, but mellows immediately. Notes of apricot, sour dough, some pine, and fruit notes. I don’t taste the spice, but feel the warmth from it. Overall, a mellow, but refreshing flavor. Mouth feel, is creamy and gentle, medium body. Overall, A good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a foggy pale orange with a fluffy three fingers of off-white foam. Head retention is great, forming a stoic layer above the beer for a long time. Aroma is pale, biscuity, wafery, crackery, earthy malts with slight resiny, herbal hops. A little clove rounds it out. Flavor profile is resiny, herbal, grassy hops that reside at the back of the tongue after the malts finish singing the chorus. Malts are biscuity, wafery, crackery and pale. A little lemon grass and clove lingers towards the finish. Mouth feel has a bubbly effervescent that somehow expands and fizzes on the tongue as it hits, growing the texture from start to swallow. Crispness creeps on towards the finish, after the initial foamy expansion on the tongue. Overall, bubbly and yet crisp with a refreshing display of malts and hops behind. Balance is great with a little playfulness. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle. Bottled 12/21/2018, consumed and reviewed 05/14/2020.",

That’s not to say this is bad, but Duvel is amazing. I’m not getting a lot on the nose. It’s dry with a bit of funk. I wouldn’t know it’s a Belgian immediately but after a couple of sips it’s apparent. A great beer but maybe better fresh?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a medium straw color - like an IPA. Sweet Belgian candi sugar aroma. Flavor is very typical of a Belgian, but softer from the age. Touch of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is appropriate, medium bodied. Overall an ok beer, might have aged it too long...\n\n3/23/20\n500 ml bottle dated 4/17/18 - thanks Adam!\n4 rating",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Golden yellow in color with light orange hues and hazy, unfiltered appearance. Poured with an obscenely large, billowy, white foam with excellent retention. Wheat malt and fruity pear aromas with light notes of under-ripe banana. Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Creamy smooth feel with expanding boozy warmth through the finish. Sweet fruit flavors, pear and light banana followed by spicy coriander. Malty and fruity flavors on the back end with spicy coriander tapering to the end. Finished dryly with a lingering spicy flavor. Fantastic display of Belgian esters. Mellow fruitiness balanced with spiciness and boozy warmth.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a light yellow with a mild haze to it. Huge head formation. When it calms down it recedes to a finger of pure white foam. It persists for quite a while. \n\nNose is yeast funk, banana, clove, mild citrus zest, perhaps lemon. Vibrant scents jumping out of the glass. Very appealing.\n\nTaste is denser than the nose. Richer. But similar. Some nice bitterness from the hops counteracting the touch of sweetness from the malt.\n\nMouthfeel is medium bodied with mild carbonation. Very smooth.\n\nNot a huge fan of the Belgian Pale Ales, but I was quite impressed with this brew. Having limited access to Russian River its hard to snag bottles, but I pick one up whenever I get the chance. I look forward to seeing the rest of their accomplishments.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rating from notes. 375 ml bottle purchased by my wife at City Beer Store in San Francisco, California. Consumed January 2014. &quot;Bang on for the style.&quot; 3.88/5",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I got one of these expensive bottles of World-Class beer from Whole Foods for $7 each. Poured into a stemless wine glass because I don't have a tulip or goblet, the recommended glassware for this style. \n\nLook: The golden color of the body is reminiscent of unfiltered Buckwheat honey, an orange-hued amber. Super fluffy, frothy, choppy, and billowing slightly off-white head. The body is hazy and shows ample carbonation from the bottle fermentation. When the cork is popped, the bottle oozes smoke like some Harry Potter shit. The lacing drags down the glass like foamy bunting. \n\nSmell: Right after popping the cork, I immediately get an incredibly complex aroma of toasted challah, fig, a touch of orange zest, phenolic clove, banana, delicate white pepper, and caramel. This stuff smells mouthwateringly good.\n\nTaste/Mouthfeel: The incredibly rich bready taste has mounds of caramel, toasted challah bread, browned butter, light hop spice, earthy hops, biscuit, and sophisticated yeast-derived banana and fig flavors intertwined throughout the perfectly balanced yet still malt dominant flavor profile. The flavors explode across the palate as this liquid genius glides down the throat. The hopping perfectly balances and complements the other flavors, yielding pure earthy and slightly spicy mild bitterness to back things up. The body is overall a solid medium; hearty with enjoyable chewiness. The well-hidden alcohol is slightly warming as the beer comes up in temp, with a reassuring kiss of sultry euphoria that caresses the mind and spirit. \n\nOverall: Incredible this beer is outstanding evidence of just how good Russian River Valley is. I loved digging my nose into the soft, smooth foam of the aromatic head and gulping down the cool liquid genius. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, with such deliciousness that each richly pleasurable drink makes you go &quot;mmm&quot; and smack your lips. This is one of the best breweries in the world. This beer is extremely delicious in every way. A fantastic example of the style, one of the best beers I have ever had.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The beer pours with much froth with a slight stinging sensation when tasted. Once adjusted, the warmth of the ale surrounds and it becomes another solemn moment in the mind of a monastery. Excellent!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had an older bottle - almost one year since bottling. \n\nCork busted out of the bottle as I opened the wire cage. Super carbonated. White fluffy choppy heady. Cracker smell which come forward in the taste. Some citrus in the nose. Chardonnay dryness, flavor of pear with the skin on. Strong yeast, especially in the aftertaste.\n\nCarbonation really messes with the mouthfeel for me - quite possibly due to aging, but otherwise sound brew.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cloudy golden body with ton of carbonation leading to a big white fluffy head. When I opened the cage, the cork popped itself out about 5 seconds later like champagne. Smell features belgian yeast, black pepper, grass, hay, fruit esters, grains, spices and citrus zest. Taste is about the same, little brett thrown in, but otherwise what the smell indicates. Feel has the grains and yeast qualities to it, but elevates with the airy carbonation and the dryness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev An impatient beer, I removed the cage &amp; it ejected the cork. It couldn’t wait to be poured. A partial pour resulted in a glass full of the fluffiest foam ever. Using the side of the glass &amp; a gentle pour I was able to transfer Damnation to my glass. Ten minutes later that massive head head stands tall over a hazy amber body pepper, clove &amp; breast Belgium heats make up its aroma. Lovely balance of taste &amp; flavors with a spicy, hoppy, dry finish. Excellent feel. . I look forward to Damnation."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer has a cloudy appearance, but everything else about it is pure sunshine. The citrusy taste isn’t overpowering, just enough for the drink to be refreshing. Perfect for a sunny day.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev If you love lemonade and light beer, Summer Shandy will send you to heaven. I don't fit that demographic, but it's still a refreshing sip on a hot summer day.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is tied for my all time favorite beer along with Wittenkerke's white ale. \n\nVery crisp, and light. One of those shandy/fruity beers that still tastes like beer. Taste is great, just a little bit tart and very refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp at times, but man is this a delicious beer if you like light, crisp and tart.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Too much lemon",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is just a really refreshing beer for the summertime that packs some great citrus flavor.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light, wheaty and tart. I like sour beers but tart not really. It's not overly pronounced but enough that I'm not enjoying this one. Still refreshing, but too many better choices out there to go back to this one.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I currently live in a Deep South rural hollow that has a liquor store and a Wal-Mart, so I don't get much of a selection, although thankfully, Hoegaarden, my global go-to beer, is available! Being a fan of Leiny's Vanilla Porter (which used to be Creme Stout) ever since doing a half-year-long gig in Wisconsin years ago, I decided to try this Summer Shandy. I'm a fan of fruity wheat bears like (where can I get it now?) Sam Adam's Blackberry Wit that get it right, so I decided to try this; I was not disappointed. In fact, now that the oppressive summer heat is in full swing with triple-digit heat index conditions, I find this beer irresistible; its essence is perfectly in tune with my loud A/C. Perhaps I have just needed a change of pace from the Hoegaarden, which I drink all the time, any season, any continent.\n\nYes, it's a bit light on the wheat part, but it's still there, and of good quality. Yes, there lemon is strong, but isn't an American wheat beer supposed to have lemon slice or two (or three) in it? I was bit leery of trying a beer that seeks to be strong in citrus, as I remember trying a Berliner Tart (perhaps also a Leiny?) that I had found painful, but this Summer Shandy nails it at just the right level of tart &amp; sweetness while still feeling like &quot;beer&quot;. Can't decide between lemonade &amp; beer? This is the answer that splits it down the middle!\n\nTo the beer snobs that have to have an IPA, go elsewhere with your bitter brew. Is there a better representative of this style? Sure, get me a Boulevard ZŌN with some lemon slices; I haven't been able to find that since the summer years ago that I spent in southern Illinois. OTOH, Summer Shandy can be found at any major grocer anywhere in the USA. What are you going to do? In my fridge, Summer Shandy is next door to Sam Adam's Summer Ale (also easily available locally, and I am a huge fan of SA's Winter Ale), but I keep reaching for the Shandy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (~90% opacity), light pale lemon color with a moderate white head. SRM of 6. (4.00)\n\nAroma: Strong aromas of lemon citrus, sweet candied lemon, lemonade, and some lemon pound cake underneath. (4.00)\n\nFlavor: Strong flavors of unfiltered lemonade, wheat, more candied lemon. Leans sweet. (3.50)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Finishes somewhat clean on the palate. (3.50)\n\nCompared to Fulton Blonde 6/8/21: Pours a lighter color. A stronger lemon aroma. Less honey and malt body. Lighter and cleaner\n\nOverall: Pretty much what I expected for a lemon shandy here. Strong lemonade and lemon shandy flavors. Not bad for a light, fruity, and crisp alcoholic beverage. Notice I said &quot;alcoholic beverage&quot; and not beer. Not sure I would classify this as a beer. I think it drinks closer to a cider, cocktail, or mimosa, you decide. Nevertheless, it's a tasty offering from Leinenkugal. Is it surprising that this is the first drink I like from them and it is the one that is furthest from a beer? Maybe Leinenkugal should stick to things besides beer, because the more they try and make it a beer, the less I seem to like it. This may be their best &quot;beverage&quot; I've tried. (Final Rating: 3.65+)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It tastes like someone mixed Country Time Lemonade into a crappy beer.\nIf you want a shandy, you're better off making your own from scratch.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Ridiculously pleasing brew! Lemonade flavor is strong enough to taste but not overpowering. Easy drinking and quite satisfying.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I look at the ratings and feel like a lot of people forget there's some things that just require some context and this one. My first time having this was at a ball game and it was easily one of the best things consumed. It's a gathering beer, a fun time, I'd be extremely happy knowing what I know and finding this at a stadium cuz I'd for sure rather get it than macro stuff. It was just good idk, ease up and have fun",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Golden, refreshing, crisp and lemony. Flavor is light, this is a great compliment to any warm meal on a hot day.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I poured this 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. In the beginning there was a 1/2&quot; head of pure white foam over a hazy straw yellow near the bottom of the glass, but a slight orange hue added to the top half of the glass. The foam settled back to a thin layer with a large amount of carbonation cascading to the surface.\nThe aroma is sweet lemon of course with the with a light amount of malt notes. This is what I would expect from a beer with lemons on the label.\nThe taste is a sweet lemon drop flavor, very fizzy on the tongue. The mouth feel is light. There is not anything malty or hoppy in the flavor.\nI had this after mowing lawn today, it quenched my thirst. This is enjoyable on a very warm day, very easy to sample a few. A couple of these find there way to my fridge each summer. Summer Shandy has found a little niche here in Wisconsin.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Rating this as my first review of a brew I have enjoyed over the years, especially in the summer. I choose to enjoy my beverage out of the bottle so I rate look based on the bottle and respective bottle cap. This is the perfect beer for when the weather gets warm here in Michigan and listening to tunes while enjoying this beer is fantastic. It goes down smooth, however, I am not a huge fan of the sugary aftertaste this brew leaves. As I said, it is great for sitting with some friends on a warm evening, but it is not what I would classify as a &quot;world-class&quot; beer by any means.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not bad!!!! This is not a classic craft beer by any standard but as a summertime thirst quencher - it fits the bill!!!! Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Has a medium size foamy white head with good retention and a little filmy lacing on the glass. Hazy grapefruit color. Aroma and taste are 'lemon drop candy&quot; and a very slight wheat bitterness. Nothing complicated, but pleasant enough!!! Mouthfeel is crisp and tart, not too light - just right for belting down a few on a hot day."

I managed to wrangle up 4 different ones, and plan to try them in order of lowest to highest ranking, starting here just short of the top 250 at #310. I’m too excited so let’s just get into it\n\nPours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nOh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper\n\nThe funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dry white wine, pear skin, white grape, smooth oak, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of earthy white wine, sharp oak, wet hay, clove, lemon juice, apple skin, and leather\n\nA light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes quite dry and funky\n\nThis one is very good, but the straight up funk holds it back just a little bit. Still, it’s masterfully done, and I can’t wait to try the rest",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had a 2014 on tap in 2022\nLook - Clear golden color with a nice white head and slight lacing. Shocked it looks this good\nSmell - grainy tart citrus.

Would love to try fresh and see the difference",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had this right after PtY, been wanting to try this almost as long as Pliny. Certainly one of the top sours I haven’t been able to try. Fathom Bistro &amp; Bar on Shelter Island, San Diego. So much funk and delicious barrel character. The definition of a sour blonde. Wayyyy to easy to drink. Wow!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Golden color, nicely hazy, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is green grape, lemon, oak, and da funky Brett.\n\nThe taste is very refined, with the green grape and funky Brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate, with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious. \n\nThe mouthfeel is bright and fizzy, per the style. An excellent wild ale, IMHO.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 3-27-2020. Poured in Tulip.\nExcellent chardonnay aroma with slight earthy notes. Chardonnay is the main note in the taste followed by some apple and pear. Very dry and bitter. Tasty.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottled 6 months ago.\n\nPours semi-hazy sunshine orange with a persistent off-white head.\n\nThe nose is lemon, peach, pineapple, oak, and light cheesy funk.\n\nThe taste follows. Lemon, pineapple, orange, and oak. Low to medium tartness.\n\nThe mouthfeel opens medium and finishes dry. A touch too dry in my opinion.\n\nOverall, very good. Delicate and complex. My one knock is that it leans bitter and dry on the finish, which undercuts the fresh fruit notes that are so prominent on the nose.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev *Aroma: Oaky, white wine, Chardonnay\n*Looks: Pale amber, lemony hazy, 1.5 finger head that sticks around\n*Taste: AMAZING! What a superbly made beer! Notes of Chardonnay, but slight sour ale notes with perfect dryness, this is a truly well made, work of art! I am speechless.\n*Finish: Balanced, delicious, champagne-like but sour ale! Better than most Belgian Sour Ales. And that’s saying a lot.\n*Overall Verdict*: A+++ all the way. Russian River has made an instant winner with this beer at 7.5% abv, super smooth, amazing balance, amazing sour notes balanced by carbonation. Perfect style for whatever the style it represents!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev RR beers are incredibly difficult to find on the East Coast, especially in PA, where (according to one source) they are randomly distributed. Was very excited to discover a few dusty bottles dated 050118 at Waywood Beverage in Kennett Square, PA. Opened on 1-10-20 and poured into a champagne flute. \n\nA: Clear straw gold. Rocky white head that settles quickly. Some lacing remains after letting the beer open up for a minute.\n\nS: Strong lactic sourness. Vinous white wine notes followed by golden raisin. Initially detected a sweet citrus (tangerine) aroma. Apparent oak tannins on the nose.\n\nT: Carbonic bite followed by golden raisin, citrus and lactic acidity. The acidity is not as sharp as I had assumed from the aroma - its actually far more restrained and well balanced, like a sparkling moscato or chardonnay. \n\nM: The combination of high carbonation and tannins create a full mouthfeel despite the thin body. Some lingering silkiness, perhaps owing to soft water (pure speculation).\n\nO: Very well rounded flavor profile and balanced body. This is an elegant and quaffable beer, with just enough funk and acidity to be rustic and refreshing and not toilet stall and corrosive.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Funky with a nice tartness to balance it out. Great Chardonnay barrel as well. Very solid beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Great wood notes that blends well with the chardonnay and ale. Quite sour but not over the top. Low carbonation.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Mostly clear gold, violent effervescence, with a massive, rocky white head that leaves webbed lacing.\n\nDistant chardonnay, just a little tartness, a hint of funk and some wood in the nose.\n\nGreat white wine sweetness first upon sipping gives away immediately to some sharp brett coupled by some great funk and wood. It’s a funky-ass beer.\n\nLight bodied and almost pillowy feeling.\n\nTo my preference, I’d love if the fruity wine character could hold its ground against the brett just a little longer — but this is still an excellent concoction."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Delightful dark roast coffee flavors with a hint of chocolate. Crisp, light, and ultimately refreshing.\nAbout as good a porter as any I've tried.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A true American classic. This porter is quite a treat bursting with caramel and chocolate notes. A deep brown dark chocolate color with a nice white-brown head is magnificent. Raise to your nose and you are met with roasted aromas and the beer tastes malty and smooth like melted dark chocolate. A great beer reminiscent of a mocha coffee.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the rear label: &quot;PKG050521&quot;\n\nAppearance: It has a black body with a large, thick, khaki head. The head has a creamy texture on top with shallow lumps and ripples across its surface. Head retention is good and as it slowly recedes it leaves a nice sheet of thick cobweb lacing with large round gaps in the sheeting. It looks exactly like you would picture a Porter in a magazine.\n\nAroma: There isn't much going on in the aroma here. It has a bit of a phenolic, rubbery scent. As the beer sits there is a scent of nail polish. Very odd aromas.\n\nTaste: Up front there is nail polish and a bit of toasted caramel. Towards the middle the nail polish character comes through even stronger. There is a pleasant note of coffee and faint burnt carbon. The nail polish character really kills the other flavors.\n\nMouthfeel: There is a medium roasted grain bitterness to the beer and a body that rests on the upper edge of medium. Carbonation feels fine. Drinkability is low given the flavor and aromas.\n\nOverall: A very disappointing beer. The off-flavors in this beer really hamper any positive characters that might have a chance at getting out. I wouldn't recommend this beer. I wouldn't buy it again unless I could try it directly from the brewery to see if it was an issue with the batch, the packaging, or if the recipe is consistently like this.",

I’m picking up on aromas of roasted barley, dark bread, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate malt, and very mild earthy hops\n\nA slightly less delicate balance is achieved in taste, leaning more into the bitter and roasty side of things. As I said, this is not particularly my preference, but it is well done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark roast coffee, roasted barley, herbal hops, dark chocolate, and toffee.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Anchor Porter pours a dark brown color. Opaque, but still thinner in appearance. Lovely thick khaki head forms on the beer - about 3-4 fingers - and then dissipates leaving a thin layer of velvety foam on top of the beer. The aroma on this is dominated by a strong sweet caramel character. Caramel malt, sweet chewy caramel, and secondary to that stronger note you get notes of roasted malt, toffee, cocoa, and a hint of coffee-like notes. Its honestly kind of sweet on the nose which I wasn't really expecting. \n\nThe flavor then follows the nose with a strong caramel toffee character to the beer. Notes of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and a light piney hop character all cascade across the palate. Its mildly sweet. Feel is light to moderately bodied. Very silky smooth and velvety on the mouthfeel. Sprity, but balanced carbonation.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very dark brown appearance with an average size tan head and modest lacing. Whiff of acetone early on in the aroma before returning to the more identifiable traits of roasted malts and earthy hops. Taste maintains the roasted malt characteristics along with a hint of dark fruits and caramel. Floral, resinous hops are held in check but still noticeable. Medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel leading to a lingering finish."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 500mL bottle. Pale and golden, slightly cloudy, with a massive pillowy white head. A little bit of lemon zest in the aroma? Flavor is like a high gravity wheat beer, like you'd expect from the &quot;weizenbock&quot; label. Not malty sweet, but wheat-sweet. There's a depth of flavor here, but not much dimension (if that makes any sense). Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and finish is likewise cloying. But other than that, taste-wise it's not bad. It does hide its 7.7% ABV remarkably well.\n\nBeer Advocate says this is the #2 rated Weizenbock, but the gap between this and Aventinus is mammoth.",

Aren't you over using it? Who are you trying to make laugh? A child? lol pee\n\nSmell: Banana flavored candy, Bread, yeast, cloves, nutmeg? idk do i smell these or am i just imagining it and acting like i know my smells. would you even trust an internet cat girl with this?\n\nTaste: Tastes how it smells pretty much. slight alcohol taste at the end. pretty sweet beer kinda like a wheat beer\n\nFeel: This is probably one of my least favorite textures that has ever gone down my throat and ive gotten retainers before where they took a casting of your mouth using that god awful putty thing. It's in the middle of creamy and watery, like milk diluted with water but you decided to abandon humanity and carbonate it with your soda stream. The carbonation foams up in your throat and just is the worst feeling ever. If you wanted to fulfill your fantasies of being violated, just drink this beer. \n\nOverall: At least for me, this beer ain't it chief. The taste and smell are perfectly serviceable, but the god awful mouthfeel just kills it. Don't know if i got a bad one or just this beer sucks. I am sad cuz I literally cant drink this or else i feel like throwing up so I might have to sadly waste beer ):",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Light orange/very yellow. Mild wheat aroma. Malty taste. Fairly high carbonation. Medium crushability",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Delicious! Wunderbah with banana slightly over the clove...sweet but highly drinkable...no alcohol bite! A desert beer!!!"

Actually kind of impressed. No medicine taste just a cranberry taste without the bitterness. Just surprisingly great. For what it is.\nF: medium body, low if any carbonation, creamy. Very pleasant.\nO: I don’t have much bad to say about it besides the smell. Definitely worth trying, not worth a 2nd try for most people but I bet some people would seriously love this brew.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Probably my favorite beer to date. Love the strong raspberry taste",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really bright pink. Smells almost like cherry medicine; very floral and fruity. Smells bright and refreshing. Taste is really sweet. Tastes like fresh raspberries. Very little to make you think it’s a beer. Feel is light. Small bubbles and very refreshing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured a red-ish weak iced tea color and was topped with a pink (yes, pink) head. Not a lot of lacing.\nThe aroma was all about the raspberries, but as this is a raspberry ale, that makes perfect sense. They nailed the smell.\nThe taste, well, follows. Pure raspberry with *just* enough malt presence to keep it from being a hard soda. \nFeel is surprisingly viscous - not syrupy but not thin. Really made me slow down and enjoy a bit.\nOA, if you like the taste of Raspberries or fruited beers, give this one a try. If you don't, well, don't!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Smells &amp; tastes like raspberries. Well hidden ABV. A good fruit beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 4/19/21, so plenty fresh.\n\nL---Clear, rich red color with a fluffy, light pink head. Head had good retention and left good lacing. \n\nS---Well, raspberries. \n\nT---Still raspberries. But it smells and tastes like real, fresh raspberries. A one trick pony, but it's pretty good at that trick.\n\nF---Light/medium body with good carbonation.\n\nO---A really nice one from a world class brewery. They absolutely hit what they were aiming for.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A: Poured from the 12 oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a dark red color that is clear when held to light. Head is foamy, off-white, and 2 fingers with moderate retention.\n\nS: Sugary raspberry jam with a bit of bread and pie crust to hold it together. Not complex, just fruitiness and a bit of pie. Not that that's a bad thing...\n\nT: A bolder, juicer flavor than I was expecting. This isn't quite in your face but the taste is all raspberry all the way through and has a lot of character. There is a certain something holding it together, so it's not just juice and it's not a sugary mess. \n\nOverall: More elevated and drinkable than I thought. I was picturing a sort of lambic, but this is not tart at all. It has a pleasant juiciness to it, and it feels like a nice summer drink.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Outstanding beer but you have to get the nitro tap. Bottles and cans do not do this beer justice. Smooth mouthful. Amazing taste.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours dark pink with an off-white head. Faint fieldberry on the nose. The taste is sweet/tart raspberry with a nice malty background. You can tell that this is real raspberries and not just flavouring. A nice summertime quencher. \nJune 24 2021",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap at Cardinal Pub &amp; Bar, Stavanger (also available there on 355 ml bottles). Red colour, thin off-white head. Strong and lovely aroma of ripe raspberries and raspberry flowers. Medium sweet flavour, distinct notes of raspberries throughout, refreshing. Nice fruit beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fruity and beery enough in good measure, so if you're gonna drink fruit beer this one is suited to the job. Raspberries properly the flavour the beer, but is maybe not solid enough on the nose. Pale pink, not much by way of a head or lacing. Drink this if you like raspberries. Simple and tasty is what it is about.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear pour with pink and raspberry tone. Impressive white head with light pink shade. Lacing was good. Aroma was nothing crazy, but with tad hints of raspberry. Most likely due to puree mix. The taste was dominated by raspberry, but not overwhelming. I also tasted tart and malt. Moderate carbonation with light body. Surprising smooth. Only 15 IBU and reasonably priced. Fruit beers are easy to mess up, but the overall balance presented well for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Raspberry red, not much of a head. Smell is muted— strawberry, apple, a watery softness. Taste follows— raspberry, strawberry, apple, light sourness on the finish. As I drank it, it seemed to get a bit more syrupy. Feel is nice, moderately carbonated. \nIf I had a sip of this blind I might guess that it was a raspberry soda. It’s good for sure, but I’m left wanting a bit more complexity from it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev look: big frothy light pink head, beer is a lovely clear ruby red colour, good levels of carbonation in the beer.\n\nsmell: lovely fresh fruit aroma, raspberry, obviously, some cherry, white bread malt, biscuit, hint of citrus fruit, sweet of course, smells good.\n\ntaste: all raspberry really, some malt flavour, white bread and biscuit, also some citrus fruit, and cherry, hint of caramel, really sweet, nice enough, just a little one dimensional.\n\nfeel: light to medium bodied, light to medium carbonation, little watery, drinkable enough, refreshing.\n\noverall: nice enough beer here, good just use a little more character and depth of flavour maybe, but it’s still pretty nice",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reddish-burnt orange color with minimal head. Aroma: not very strong scent of berries. Sweet/slightly tart. Very pleasant flavor, very berry &amp; raspberry &amp; wheat. Ample carbonation. Overall, very tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Much more raspberry if not even raspberry soda than beer. If there is any beer taste underlying the raspberry flavor, I don't detect it at all. Would much rather it have at least a little bit more beer character to it",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a raspberry pinkish red with a pink head that dissipates quickly. Smells like fresh raspberries with a little bit of maltiness to it. Taste is simply amazing. It's like fresh raspberry juice with barely enough malty sweetness and the slightest hop bitterness to remind you that you're drinking beer instead of soda. The feel is slightly more carbonated than your average brew, but it doesn't detract from the experience at all. Overall this is a genuinely awesome beer. If you like fruit beers this one is for you."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pretty solid winter warmer. was spicy and grainy and definitely a warmer. was the highlight of the holiday variety pack for sure, but still a middle ground warmer. if you're looking for a solid sipper, it checks the boxes, but isn't a high caliber warmer or worth the purchase of the pack on it's own merits. shame there's only two in the box, but also, don't believe i'd sit and sip this one past 2-3 anyhow.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Old Fezziwig is among my favorite Sam Adams beers. There is a lot of flavor going on. It's simply delicious. That's saying a lot for a guy who loves German beers &amp; not many American beers. But this beer, a spiced ale, has an abundance of malt flavor &amp; spicy notes along with many of the darker notes of a German dunkel, like a bit of caramel &amp; some of the lighter notes of a porter. This is a great beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev There are much better winter warmer beers out there. The look is unappealing - just dark with no sparkle. The taste is all malt and there is little spice character and the aftertaste is medicinal. Spend the extra money on a better beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear deep reddish-amber, with about 1/2&quot; of light tan head, that leaves a thin ring and surface sheet of foam. \n\nSmell is toffee, caramel, light biscuity malt, and hints of nuts and (moist) dried fruit. The overall aroma is good, but quite light. \n\nTaste is mostly a light mix of toffee, caramel, raisin, and cooked nuts, with brief flashes of orange rind, clove and, nutmeg, finishing with a general light spiciness (coriander &amp; black pepper) that lingers a bit. \n\nFeel is medium, barely-slick, with moderate, moderately-bitey , fine carbonation. \n\nWinter warmers are not among my favorites - more of a once-in-awhile-in-the-right-mood thing - but I'd put this among the top echelon of those. I used to get a 6er or 2, when you could do that, but at this moment, the 2 in the 12pk is plenty. Good while it lasts, but that's plenty enough. :)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fantastic holiday beer. It has a slightly spicy gingerbread smell, but not overpowering. It has a light malt flavor up front with mild but noticeable hop flavor and finishes with a nice sweet aftertaste. It is not so thick or syrupy as you might expect, the mouthfeel is about like a normal brown or amber ale. All in all, I am very happy with the balance. It is a winter warmer without being overdone and it is super smooth and easy to drink. It certainly lives up to its reputation as a fine holiday beer.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The star of the holiday variety pack! I really wish it actually had a little fruitier flavor. Light malt, yes light malt, slightly fruity. Idk why but it tastes slightly plastic like. They smell is fantastic. I wish I liked the flavor more but to me it needs to be stronger. Not in the bitter sense, but the fruit I guess. For such an iconic holiday brew the flavor needs to set itself apart more. I'll grab one of the two in the box, but in a six pack? Nah. Holiday nostalgia",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle. Label is notched to indicate best before April of 2021.\nDeep amber colored body. Thin finger of off white head, further recedes to a partial cap. Leaves some bands of lacing on the non-drinking side.\nAroma of dark malts with toffee. Also expresses spices of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.\nTaste is a mix of the dark roasted malts and the spices. Has toffee from the malts. Has spices of black pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg. All quite subtle, but the aftertaste brings the spices into the nose.\nA little thinner than medium mouth feel. Very little sweetness nor bitterness. Mostly a savory presentation. Good carbonation.\nGood beer to sip during the colder months. Not bold in smell nor flavor, but pleasant enough as an alternative to a basic porter or if a truly spiced holiday ale is too much.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: Ruby brown body, pretty light head. \nS: Rich caramel malt, sweet, slightly alcoholic, notes of cinnamon and allspice, a bit of cherry. \nT: Some dark fruit- plum and cherry, sweet caramel, citrus notes, hints of spice, and a bready finish. \nF: Very crips, high carbonation, lightly syrupy. \nO: Tastes like the big brother to their winter lager. I dig the dark fruit and caramel, though there isn’t as much spice present in the body as I had hoped. Still, really enjoyable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It's back! 11/5/2021\n\nL: Very red, with some brown.\nS: Up the nostril, took in some heavy gingerbread, spice, I wish I knew my spices better, nutmeg? Even some sweetness.\nT: Unique spice taste. Clove, molasses gives way into spice, then ends with a bit of a bitter tinge to them at the end, not really a light metallic, have a feeling it's the spices. Followed by a sweet malty and bitter aftertaste.\nF: Good carbonation. Not watery at all in my opinion, no sticky mouth feel. Not sure what this other guy was talking about unless he heated his up haha.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A rich, spicy, and wonderfully complex Christmas ale.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The old man only makes an appearance during the Christmas season and he’s very limited this Covid year, but he definitely brought the cheer! This poured into a nice burnt firewood color that would appear to warm you as if it was brewed in a chimney on a cold Christmas Eve. A nice snow cap like froth sits on this dark sea of holiday liquid. A lift of the glass to the nose and you are greeted by ginger and cinnamon notes. As you dive into this beer you are hit with the cinnamon and ginger that you had smelled previously but now an orange after taste tickles your throat. A nice roasted taste that reminded me of cola. Lastly, this beer is such an easy ale that warms your soul! Merry Christmas!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A smooth drinking IPA that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head. The head lingers for a while in the glass which is great. The beer gives off wonderful hoppy.earthy aromas with a tropical twist. The taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes, but with some tropical fruit notes too. This definitely packs a wallop at 7.5%, but does drinks more like a session. Could definitely have more than one, but I would not advise, as the alcohol could sneak up on you. Enjoy the drinkability and smoothness of this wonderfully crafted IPA!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I’ve been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a Hop Devil. It is still one of my favorites. Great flavor, color, nose, and flavor. Victory excels again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance:\nLiquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing.\n\nBouquet:\nFloral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive.\n\nFeel:\nA cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.\n\nTaste:\nBright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.\n\nOverall:\nMeh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention. Heavy lacing to end.\n\nStrong aroma of pine, grapefruit, earthy, floral.\n\nTaste is resiny, pine, slight spiciness, including pepper.\n\nMedium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.\n\nThis is a damn good IPA! One of the best.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. I have one of these left but here are my thoughts now.\nPoured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy.\nThe aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there.\nThe flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry.\nThe mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry\nOverall, not for the faint of heart, this is what old school DIPA's seem to have started out as. This is one I would come back to preferably for me.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pretty awful. I love a bitter west coast IPA but this is like licking dirt. Theres no redeeming malty balance\nIts pithy and downright awful imo.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a 12oz bottle dated enjoy by 5/6/20. Pours a golden translucent yellow with about two fingers of white fluffy head. Moderate retention, decent lacing. Smells of fresh cut grass. Not picking up much else. Taste is similar to the nose. Grassy and bitter. Mouthfeel is dry with a bitter aftertaste. This a palate wrecker. Overall, not picking up the fruitiness described on the label, but it's not awful. Pretty much a hop bomb. Price point is favorable as well, less than $11 for a 6er.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It pours clean, retains a slight head with fine lacing, looks decent, gold with very few particles, it smells nice and naturey but I couldn't taste anything! Nothing except a very slight sour pinch from tropic fruits and tiny bit of bitter. Interesting... For a beer that has &quot;Hop&quot; in the name I figured it'd be like most IPA's but this one is extremely unusual. I guess it's ok, goes down easy and has high ABV. Hell, I'd try it again just to see if it really doesn't have any taste.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle enjoy by 06 May 2020 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber with abundant off white head. The head slowly settles to thick cap leaving the glass covered in lacing. The aroma dank and earthy predominantly with notes of citrus and pine underneath. The taste is more of the same with citrus and pine given the heavy hitting Simcoe punch over a pleasant light malt body. Heavily bitter throughout (no surprise). The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, very good, but not in my taste preference. I'm not a big Simcoe fan and it dominates this beer IMO. Still very well made and a nice reminder of this beer blowing my mind years ago.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a semi translucent light honey color with a foamy white head , which dissipates quickly. Smell is reminiscent of citrus,mild toffee, (never used that description for an IPA), hay and earth. Taste is some fruitiness and some dank earth flavor.Mildly astringent. Surprised at the large malt bill, hops get washed away too quickly by a malt rush. (Uneven?) Feels well carbonated, medium body,finishes juicy. Overall if it did not have such an edge the malt bill could be reduced in my opinion. Seems the added malt was necessary because of the beer's astringency. Definitely get walloped by the hops. Good beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz bottle fresh\nPoured about 20oz in a nice tall ale glass\nBeautiful classic appearance of clear and golden ale with a big foamy white head that sticks around.\nThe aroma is not overpowering, but very pleasant of citrus and tropical fruit and some biscuit\nthe flavor starts with the biscuit malt and is quickly surpassed by bitter grapefruit from the hops. There is some caramel from the malt and some sweet mango at the end.\nThis is a superb IPA and the price point is fantastic at $10/six."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev At the Philly airport.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I used to love this IPA. If fact, it was one of my favorite. But something has changed. It no longer has a &quot;Hop Forward&quot; style. Consequently it has a more noticeable malt taste. Along with the high ABV, the taste no longer has a WOW factor. Sad to see this once great beer for hop heads become what it has. Now I'll order other west coast IPAs instead.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours golden yellow with a 1.5&quot; white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.\n\nAroma is floral, pine, grapefruit, grass.\n\nExcellent grapefruit &amp; pine taste with underlaying notes of caramel. Resinous.\n\nMedium bodied, moderate carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.\n\nAnother very good DIPA form Troegs.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Crystal clear golden color with a bone white head that laces the glass beautifully. The nose is straight citrus and resiny pine, definitely in the WCIPA style. \n\nThe taste has citrus up front, with grapefruit rind and ripe oranges, then the resiny pine closes the taste with a very nice bitter finish that is very dry.\n\nThis is the very definition of crushable and would always be in my beer fridge if I had regular access to it. Highly recommended if you like the WCIPA style, which I do.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful medium amber with a sticky, clotted head of white foam. Great lacing and persistence keeping the beer capped from beginning to end.\nHop aromas fill the room upon pouring. Grapefruit, lavender and sage mix with bread dough and honey in an inviting mix of smells that draw you in by the nose.\nLight sugars up front are followed by sharp hop flavors of more citrus rind, bitterness comes in quickly washing most of the malt character and body away. \nHighly attenuated and light on the tongue this is a hop showcase and offers only a hint of balance, but thats almost enough.\nVery drinkable with a mild, lingering hop bite on the finish.\nThis is a weak Imperial IPA that lacks malt body,flavor and balance. It is in my opinion and decent IPA, as 7.5% is not quite Imperial level and the grain and malt presence is overshadowed sharp hop flavors .\nHappy 4-20!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Another variety pack for me and this one's first in line. It pours clear gold with minimal head. The smell is piney with minor citrus notes coming through. I'm not getting much citrus in the taste. It's very hop-forward with about 25% mild herbal hops and 75% pungent bitter hops. Clear appearance, but murky flavor. Very smooth and easy-drinking though.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The beer doesn't look notable in any particular way, but does not look bad. It is sweet, but dank and grassy and piney on the nose. The taste is bitter with a sweetness pooping in towards the end. The hops notes a very herbal, bright, and fresh with some dank. The mouthfeel is soft and foamy. it is pleasant. Overall, it s pretty good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best By 04/14/2021 Let warm for ~10 minutes, before opening. \n\nClear gold, with 1.5 fingers of medium-coarse ivory head, that leaves a few spots of lacing. \n\nSmell is light pine, a vague citrusy mix, and a bit of (bread)crusty malt. Also some melon and pear from the open can. Smells good, but overall is a bit subdued. \n\nTaste is mostly pine and grapefruit rind, with a little grass &amp; green onion, and a light, helles-like, honey-on-toasted-grain element , near finish. Moderate bitterness. \n\nFeel is light-medium, barely slick, with moderate, soft, semi-creamy carbonation, that finishes slightly drier, and with a mild bite on the tip of the tongue. \n\nOverall , a pleasure. First time having this not-old, and won't be the last (I hope). An old(ish)-school type of IPA, but the feel of it pushes it above most. Dangerously easy-drinking. (On to #2 , as I'm typing this. ;) ) Give it a try if you like that sort of thing. :)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev this is my second favorite ipa next to dogfish head 90 minute . it's just as good except dogfidh head has a better mouth feel, a creamier feel. other than that troegss perp ipa is an Olympic gold metal winner with a perfect hoppy smell that beats better twice the price. i especially prefer the cans because they are never skunked. it tastes especially good in a regular 12oz beer glass whereas dfa 90s is better out of a beer snifter.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Served on tap at the local pub.\n\nAppearance:\nPlain, pilsner yellow with no head and limited lacing.\n---\nBouquet:\nPiney pineapple and semi-sweet malted citrus. An evocative, if underwhelming, combination.\n---\nFeel:\nA nettle of pin-prick bubbles in a depressingly starved medium. Like drinking murky water with sand in it.\n---\nTaste:\nLemon pith and harsh grapefruit override any pine or malt offerings. Finishes with thin film of tomatoey bile. Gee, just what I always wanted. Watch out. Master craftsmen at work here.\n---\nOverall:\nDon't believe the hype. It's about as impressive as stale bread.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz. bottle from Anthology Winter pack poured into a pint glass with a clear straw-golden color (more reminiscent of an AAL than an IPA) with a decent head and lacing. Aroma of pine, some citrus and hops. Taste follows aroma with grass, citrus, pine and lots of hops, hop bitterness balanced with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation and a pleasant dry finish. Overall, a very tasty AIPA/DIPA!",

There was no explicit canned date which is disappointing, but it is definitely pretty fresh just going off the taste. I give it a 97 overall; really good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a 12-oz bottle into pint glass in December 2020. There is freshest by date of March 10, 2021 on the label. I drank this less about 1 month after purchase.\n\nAppearance: Deep gold color with huge white head. It is a bright and has a hazy color, like other IPAs. Head is very thick and it lasts a long time. There is a lot of lacing on the glass.\n\nSmell: The aroma filled the room while the beer was being poured. Strong aroma of pine, citrus, and hops, as well as some sweetness like pineapple. Also a little earthy or straw aroma. Overall the pine and citrus aromas dominates the other aromas.\n\nTaste: Sweet taste with a strong bitter hops edge. There is a typical hops and citrus flavor but with some sweetness as well. This is bitter like most other IPAs. Has a very nice after taste that lasts a long time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.\n\nMouthfeel: Medium-Strong bodied, which makes this very drinkable. Medium-Strong alcohol which matches the 7.5% listed.\n\nThis is a good and interesting ImperialIPA. It has a nice mix of grapefruit, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. I like the overall balance, and that the citrus flavors are pronounced but do not dominate the flavor. It has more of a hop edge than many other IPAs. This would be a good IPA to drink often. I will definitely buy this again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I have loved this beer for quite some time, and it's a treat to finally get to review it. Freshest by 3/11/2021 it says - it's just Dec 1 so thanks to my local monger for getting it to me quickly. Of course we have the advantage that it's just 100 mi up the road.\nL: Drinking from the can, and the can looks nice. My favorite type - 16oz!\nS: I get a lot of pine in the nose. Some floral notes. otherwise very clean. I like it\nT: Delivers on the nose &amp; a bit more. Strong grapefruit rind coming in. Again, I like it. Grapefruit rind lingers and lingers.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Outstanding so called imperial pale ale. It’s simply a great pale ale. I wish they would do away with the ipa label! One of the best brewed pale ales in the country. The label should be PPA.. perpetual pale ale.. it’s very rich and has a wonderful mouthfeel, and I love this beer on snowy day with a piece of beef or lamb!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The pour is butterscotch yellow. There is no date on the can. The taste is mild papaya, orange, lemon, grapefruit, &amp; some floral notes. Cheers! B",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of my new favorite IPAs. It's very hoppy but not too harsh. Bold flavor, yet it goes down smooth with minimal aftertaste. The flavor isn't too complex, I mostly just taste hops and a hint of citrus, but it's an IPA in its purest form."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very tart beer. Nose is strong. For what it is very good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a solid burgundy with a firm haze / fog to the transparency. Head is two fingers of fluffy off-white foam. \n\nAroma is big cherry with a ripe fleshy quality. Cherries lean mostly sweet, but possess a slight funky tartness at the back. The only other dominating note is red grape, which comes in at the mid-way point, lingering through the finish. It adds a jammy sweet note to the mix. Despite the listing of numerous sweet notes, the aroma remains well balanced, with a mild funky twist at the end. It's not a lactic sour, jaw tensing sourness, instead, a playful nudge back to balance. \n\nFlavor profile is fresh cherry right out front. It's sweet, plump, and carries a very light funk to it. The back of the flavor profile is adorned by red grapes. The rest of the mix is green apple, pear, lemongrass, cellar stone, and herbal and medicinal hops. There is a twist of cough drop syrup cherry at the back, which is the detriment to each sip. It's lead with sweetness, which carries through the whole profile, being countered right at the end by a twang of funky sourness. It's not overtly sour though, acting just enough to tip the scale from sweet to balanced. \n\nMouth feel has a crisp texture adorned by a consistent, tight effervescence. It has a medium effervescence, neither hard, nor soft. Thickness is medium as well. \n\nOverall, a delicious beer driven by cherries. It remains remarkably well balanced, despite leaning on the sweet fruit of cherry to flavor it. \n\nServed in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle.",

This drinks quite sweet, with just a hint of subtle tartness to offset that as it moves along. It is rich with cherry flavor, and manages to be so without veering even slightly into medicinal territory. There are some soft woody notes in the backdrop, alongside some faint malt.\n\nF: Medium and sticky.\n\nO: A delight.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Cherry, cherry, and cherry! In some beers, that can be overwhelming and even cloying, a touch medicinal - like cough syrup. That's not the case here. The cherry flavors are huge, but natural and balanced, not unlike biting into a ripe, semi-sweet cherry.\n\nThe cherry notes are balanced by a very light but noticeable sourness; the cherries themselves aren't overly tart, but combined with the mild sourness of the beer, it creates a lovely overall experience. Additional tasting notes of oak and vanilla.\n\nThis beer is 100% as advertised, and delicious.",

Very subtle acidity. \n\nMedium bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel\n\nPure cherry goodness. I am amazed at how well this beer held up for 8 years. I was worried I held onto it for too long.

Very nice. \n\nTaste: Tart cherry perfectly balanced with sweet malt and a mildly bitter finish that complements the whole thing. Some additional fruity esters noted in all of this. \n\nMouthfeel: Slick, very nick thickness, a bit sticky, light carbonation, but it works with the overall character of this beer. \n\nOverall / Drinkability: Very very nice.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From a bottle. Pour has a very thin layer of white foam that leaves some wisps behind floating atop a vibrant clear and red body. Scent is cherry forward with notes of the wine/barley pairing and the long cask time lingering on the nose. Taste is a fascinating journey: cherry sweet/tart flavors bounce around on the nose, a bit of carbonation erupts on the tongue, and lingering and muted wine-like tastes are evident. Feel is medium bodied, at times on the heavier side, with a phenomenal aftertaste of cherry sweetness welcoming another quaff. A very interesting brew!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a 12oz. bottle poured into my New Glarus stemmed glass. This beer is a rusty red, clear, with plenty of carbonation. The head is one finger of off white foam that settled back to a thin cap after a few minutes.\nThe aroma is light, sweet cherry and malt.\nThe flavor is tart, but sweet cherries, and a very subtle hint of oak.\nThere is a fizzy feel, almost like champagne. The tart cherry flavor keeps you coming back for more. This is very easy to slip this offering down.\nIs it beer or wine? I don't know, but it is good!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Review 1499\n\nI have wanted to try this beer for quite some time now. I finally have the chance to try this beer, thank you, Jay, much appreciated. The beer is 40 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish tint with good retention. I was not expecting much retention in the head of the beer, this is a fruit beer. The beer having some retention is impressive, I have seen similar styles fall flat quickly. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a dark reddish hue with a dark copper hue. This beer is clear, considering this is a fruit beer. I was expecting some sediment or something. It does not distract from the appearance. The overall appearance is above average. \n\nThe initial aromas in the beer are cherries, sugar syrup, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect oak, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, grassy, and a hint of floral. The aromas are cherry dominant, it is hard for me to pull any other aromas out. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are cherries, malts, grass, lightly toasted malts, oak, wheat, a note of earth, floral esters, a hint of phenols, and a note of pharmaceutical. \n\nThe mouthfeel is slightly tart and dry. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium, medium-light carbonation, and full finish. \n\nIs this a beer? It is simply one awesome beer. The fruit flavors are bright and vibrant. The malt and wheat are subtle but there and the oak finishes the beer perfectly. I wish I had many more in the fridge.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice rich red that's got some brown to it. Dirty head that sticks to the sides, before retreating to swirl and ring. \n\nNose is boldly sweet cherries. Candied cherries. It's just straight candied cherries. Maybe a hint of spices (clove, cinnamon), but through and through this is sweet sweet cherries. Not quite maraschino, but almost. The missus loves it. It's sweeter than I was anticipating, almost sickly so, and I think sweeter than I'd like. \n\nThankfully it's not quite as sweet tasting as it smells. I think my mis-expectations were driven by the 'belgian red' aspect of the name, so I was thinking something significantly more sour. There's a definite tartness to the taste, but even then I wouldn't call it sour, and it doesn't match up with my limited experience with belgian reds (flanders style). But I am drilling into the wrong things here. \nThe flavour is a pleasant blend of the sweetness from the cherries and a nice tart finish that actually has elements of tart cherries/tart cherry juice, which I enjoy quite a bit. Also a lot of 'red' flavour a la fruit punch, but again, thankfully not as cloyingly sweet.\n\nAs stated, it's got some tart acidity, and some bright effervescence, but is otherwise very smoothe. \n\nThis is a masterfully put together beer. I can see why it gets the love it does. It doesn't happen to match straight up with my personal preferences, especially when it comes to cherries (and primarily on the nose), but I can see why people love it, and it is undeniably very well put together.\n\nMuch gratitude to @FBarber for sending this along my way during NBW BIF #13! Thanks Frank!",

Definitely sweet but enough of a bite that it's not too much sweetness. I could drink a lot of them in one sitting.\n\nO: Perfect for what it is. It isn't kriek-like and it isn't sour, but it doesn't claim to be. A good choice any time of year. One of my go-to's and unbeatable for $10 a 4-pack.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev First impression? Not my favorite.

Now, don’t get Raul wrong; Aunt Betsy is legit, and I’ll shotgun a Pabst with her any day of the week; but I guess I just like lighter Hefeweizens with, dare I say it?

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really good wheat beer!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Fantastic mouthfeel. Wasn't sure on the first sip, but every consecutive sip tasted better. A no BS wheat beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from an 11.2oz bottle\n\nThe look is just a touch lighter than an amber, with a decent haze but you can still see through it pretty well, translucent I guess. Pretty decent carbonation but not the most intense. It's an attractive beer for sure. Head is less than one finger on the pour but retention is very impressive maintains a fine cap for as long as there still iGerman. No lacing though.\n\nAroma is obviously very yeast forward with strong banana orange smells almost like a wit beer but just malt and hops. In the back a nice dry malt aroma.\n\nFlavor follows the aroma but less orange notes and more dry fermentation notes. A light acidity going on here. A light malt aftertaste rides along with some banana chip notes for a clean very vaguely bitter finish.\n\nFeel is all from the head bringing a nice creamy mouthfeel from fine bubbles, but still light enough to be a nice warm weather beer. Also has a big enough body to bring it to year round status.\n\nOverall a nice traditional hefeweisen pretty balanced and as usual not a lot of hops. Not sweet but not bitter a nice yeast and malt beer here good if you just want something actually german.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Best by 10/22\n\nThis is one of the classic Hefes, and other than Weihenstephan, I haven’t had many of the German examples of the style. Surprising, considering Weihenstephan is one of my favorites of all time and I enjoy the style. Let’s get into it\n\nPours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing\n\nThis one takes a sweeter approach in the nose that I quite enjoy. I’m picking up on aromas of banana, sweet honey, bready malt, pear skin, bubblegum, and earthy wheat\n\nWhile this tastes pretty good, I think it may be overly fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy wheat, banana, orange zest, doughy malt, and clove. The swallow brings notes of banana, raisin, bubblegum, earthy wheat, bready malt, pear skin, and light herbal hops\n\nA medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry but again the fruity notes shine too much\n\nDespite my one nitpick with this beer, it is delicious. A nice session beer",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev For my personal use only: Very drinkable wheat beer. Doesn't have the sometimes harsh coriander taste. Need to buy a sixpack and try it a few times.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from the can, the look of this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Opaque, thick looking beer with a thick creamy white head, lines of bubbles rising from the bottom, streaking you the brownish-red body of the beer. Striking look in the glass.\n\nThe smell is a strong point for the beer, mild banana, orange peel citrus notes, backed by a malty-bready smell. \n\nThe taste is where a lot of the really highly rated beers on here fall a bit for me. I won’t deny that it might simply be my expectations are too high. Despite that, the taste is still phenomenal compared to almost all beers out there, it’s just relatively straightforward. Citrusy clove taste that waxes and wanes with a very mild peppery taste. Very sweet wheat taste, though not as powerful as the smell would indicate. A little creamier than other weissbiers! Which I enjoyed. Plentiful carbonation without too strong of a bite makes it taste very smooth and creamy.\n\nLove that malty wheat flavour on the exhale",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A lot of Authentic marketing and feels for this european beer, but it lives up to it. I can only hope and dream that this is what central europeans drank in the 1600s. Good color , taste and finish.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Really not the biggest fan of wheat beer. It certainly has a curious flavour but again, IPAs unless from a pub tap and perhaps it's the same with wheat beers don't really do it for me. The branding and overall look of the bottle has a very original and authentic look to it and makes you feel like you're drinking something healthy!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look - 12 oz bottle poured into a tasting glass. Generous and frothy two-finger head, cloudy, and light orange in color.\n\nSmell - bananas, bubble gum, some orange, and light sweetness. all characteristics of a good and inviting hefe.\n\nTaste - solid wheat flavor with virtually no bitterness. finish is fairly creamy with a long lingering wheat aftertaste.\n\nFeel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and on par for ABV at this style at 5.5%.\n\nOverall - one of the textbook examples of the style, with a bit more creaminess on the wheat flavor than Weihenstephaner. thoroughly tasty.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle from the mixed 12 pack from Hannaford. \nLightly hazy dark straw color with a rocky white head that persists. Cereal bready and crackery maltiness with hints of floral hops and a spicy earthy yeast character.",

Overall a great representation from a German icon brewer. Well done-",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours firmly-hazed medium-gold trending darker. The head is surprisingly limited, but retains extremely well. Decent lacing. \n\nSweet banana, spicy clove, and tart wheat all are present and well-balanced on the nose. \n\nSweet bready malts on the tip of the tongue with very pronounced esters manifesting in banana and bubble gum. The clove is nearly absent here, and the wheat that was so present on the nose is also pretty restrained. As a result, it skews a little sweet.\n\nMedium-light bodied. Spicy yeast is really present as a &quot;feel&quot; more than a flavor, and uniquely so, lending excellent drinkability.\n\nA little sweeter and heavier than the best of the style, this brew is nevertheless a good representation. And it has some unique spicy character that helps set it apart from others."

Enticing. \n\nThick, heavy mouthfeel. \n\nDark chocolate slaps you in the mouth on the first sip; coffee hits you on the back end. \n\nThis feels and tastes like a delicious chocolate malt.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Still love this beer. First had in 2016 from the bottle (4.75*), then in 2017 (4.5*), then a 2016 in 2018 (3.75*). Maybe my palette has changed over the years, resulting in the lowered rating or maybe it's me aging the beer, but it's still one of my old favorites that I'll continue to buy.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap. Pours a satin black with a multi finger, tan head that lingers and leaves lacing. Nose of espresso and roasted malt. Taste follows nose with roasted malt, strong coffee, and a subtle not of chocolate to balance the roastiness. Full body and low carbonation that is absolutely velvety smooth.\nAnother great Yeti. Great Divide does these magnificently.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass, sipped for an hour and a half\n\nLook - Thick motor oil black, with a beautiful milk chocolate brown half finger head. The lacing on this beer is thick, top notch.\n\nSmell - A wonderful whisky up front, with notes of vanilla and espresso and some chocolate\n\nTaste - A nice roasted espresso with hints of chocolate and vanilla. A suprising bitterness likely accentuated by the espresso beans helps cut the maltiness. As it warms, the espresso really comes through and takes center stage, almost too much.\n\nFeel - This is a thick and chewy beer, definitely a nice slow sipper.\n\nOverall - This is a good strong stout. Pretty standard in terms of big bold flavor, however I felt the bitterness was a bit too prevalent as this stout warmed. It would have been a bit more agreeable if was slightly sweeter. Still very enjoyable, no doubt.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is one of the best coffee stouts that I ever had. This is up their with your Mikkellers, Deschutes, Avery, Founders, New Holland, Oskar Blues, &amp; Firestone Walkers of the beer world. Due to the oak aging that coffee is going to last longer than usual which is a good thing if your sitting on a bottle that is somewhere between 6 months to 1 year old. The 6 pack of highland black mocha stout that me &amp; friend drank was blown out of the water by this beast. This blows the others from the oak aged lineup out of the water as far as I'm concerned. This is as good as any coffee stout that I have ever had. It's a little pricey but worth every dime spent, a World Class stout for sure. Cheers! A",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bomber into a snifter appears black in color with a khaki head. Nose is citrus pepper, earth, roast and charred grain. Taste is bitter roast, earth, citrus, coffee and tobacco. This is medium to light in body with modest carbonation. Not bad, not great.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Reviewed from memory, have probably had about a six-pack in my life. This is fine, but does not live up to the hype.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Clear, bright amber coloring, beautiful bone white head, lasting long, looking lovely.\n\nAroma: Ah! Citrus and pine aplenty. Gorgeous. A little tropical fruit, melon and pineapple in this nose. Orange and lime, too. Ah, I say again.\n\nTaste: Boom! Just what we want from an IPA, but creamy and smooth and just delightful. Bittersweet notes blast the palate, followed by malty sweetness. None too caustic, this IPA, it's smooth and palatable as can be.\n\nI peeked at the label. Maple syrup? Not getting that yet. Huh.\n\nHop bitterness is restrained, but enjoyable. Delicious. Tasty. I'm loving it. I'm liking this so much, it's time to find out more about it. Okay, so….&quot;A bottle conditioned India Pale Ale with maple syrup.&quot; 7.5% ABV. There are some situations when 90 is too much. There are other situations when 60 is too little. There are many situations when 75 is just right. Bottle-conditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dry-hopped out the bejeezum boards.&quot;",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle. Unfortunately I did not check the bottling date, which is '10/29/19', which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. I picked this up out of the store's cooler, and didn't think I needed to date check. Anyways . . . \nCloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing.\nAroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background.\nTaste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination.\nMouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.\nI will try to try this again with a younger bottling date, but this is still a very good hoppy, but sweet, concoction.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf at a beer store in LaCrosse, WI whilst there to move my daughter into school. The beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent was mild hop notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with smooth citrus hop presence and a tangerine finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 1/11/20...pours medium copper with a light ring of white foam. Oaky nose, hints of sour. Woody. Flavors if grape, oak, and maple sweetness. Heavy bitter checked in the background. Overall a balanced sweet maltiness w/ an oaky bitter. Interesting and quite good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) into a Captain Lawrence muffin top pint; bottled 10/4/19.\nA: Pours a hazy, orange amber color with ochre highlights, a one to two finger, orange meringue colored head, full finger retention, and foamy, sticky, and persistent lacing.\nS: Aromas of caramel, pink grapefruit to orange, and pine in glorious balance.\nT: Sweet. Flavors follow the nose, but seems complex in its simplicity. Solid, but not overpowering, i.e balanced bitterness.\nM: Medium bodied with very robust carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking.\nO: I thought it was remarkable similar to the 90 minutes, which means in was just delicious. Incredibly well concocted and executed beer.",

Color is a light caramel. \n\nSmell: Very malt forward with a bitter floral hop bit. Like whole wheat bread. Some toffee notes. No maple to be found. \n\nTaste: Big and malty up front. Then a huge citric and floral hop bite comes in to the body with that distinct dogfish head IPA yeast. I’m not getting any maple here either. \n\nFeel: Too big for 7.5%. High bitterness and sweetness that do not cancel each other out. Good carbonation.\n\nOverall: The maple isn’t there and the IPA is not good enough on its own. I feel like if the maple rich sweetness was there it would help but instead the whole equation gets thrown off with that one missing part. Just okay.",

The head retention appears to be pretty good. The aroma is grainy/malty with just a touch of maple syrup, and citrusy, piney, and floral with what I'm guessing are Cascades and/or some other &quot;C hops&quot;. Hehe, I just looked at the label and it reads &quot;off-centered art series FEATURING DAN STILES&quot; - he's a friend of mine. Moving on, the flavor is fuller than the aroma might lead you to believe but it's pretty much the same. It's grainy, bready, and a little honeyish and sweet on the front of the tongue, but the hops and maple syrup immediately step in and transform it. The hops are gently citrusy, leafy, herbal, piney, and spicy. The leafy and herbal qualities enhance the malt &amp; maple syrup while the citrus, pine, and spice lend it contrast and an additional balance beyond the bitterness that's there. It's medium-full in the mouth with a delicate bristle of carbonation before warming to become smooth and creamy. It's an interesting beer. It's pretty big (how strong is it? 7.5%) and a bit sweet but it's completely balanced. It transitions from malty to malty &amp; hoppy, and then finishes drier but not too bitter with just a spritz of alcohol helping out the hops. I drank that REAL quick and I certainly didn't intend to. I've got just a swig and small sip left. The only thing that's let me down ever so slightly is that the lacing wasn't better. It still scores a 4.25 out of 5 though!\nReview #6,921",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Disappointing ipa from one of the best breweries in the USA. Smells and looks great, but tastes smoky and harsh. It does have an interesting aftertaste, but not exceptional."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev It is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass. Dark copper-amber in color, it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. It's mildly aromatic, with solid earthy and malty notes. That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness. Not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion, it's there, just well balanced by a really good malt body.",

Good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color. \nFeel...a carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice. much lacing\nOverall...This is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from Celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more... they are a victim of all of their previous successes. \nIts good why not try it!!!",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Sierra Nevada came through with just what the beer Dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves. At this price, it would be hard to pass if I was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This one smells extremely bright and hoppy. It has no trace of malts in the smell.\n\nThe taste starts out with a citrussy and dank hoppiness.  Soon after it all turns very beery with a ton of sweet malts balancing everything out.\n\nIt feels foamy and smooth in my mouth. It leaves behind a lush and bitter aftertaste.\n\nOverall it's a really good IPA.  It's got a similar taste to other Sierra Nevada IPAs but there's something more full about it.

Good clean hop bite on the finish\nMouthfeel: Full bodied but not chewy at all and lighter than both the look and taste would lead me to believe, medium-high carbonation, clean, and mild dryness on the finish\nOverall: This is delicious. As both a Sierra Nevada and fresh hop fan, this is an easy one to get behind but it is really tasty and obviously well-made. The wet Centennial hops are very prominent in the taste and aroma (flowers, citrus, grass, and rose) but this beer’s delicious malt base is equally tasty and apparent, even in a beer meant to showcase hops. Reminds me of a fresh hop Celebration Ale but I can tell it’s a fresh hop plus the malt profile is not only different tasting but lighter than Celebration. Outstanding and recommended",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Bottle served with a lime at fiesta Mexican a in moab , utah\n\nNotes: Negra Modelo, better known as &quot;the cream of the beer&quot;, is a Munich-type beer with 5.3º of alcohol that offers a balanced flavor and a delicate aroma of dark malt, caramel and hops.\n\nToday it occupies the first place in sales among dark beers in Mexico. This beer is accompanied by a bright deep amber color, which is adorned with abundant, white and compact foam.\n\nNegra Modelo was introduced in Mexico in 1925 as the dark beer called Modelo, to begin its great tradition. In 2014 it changed its image to a more sophisticated bottle but with the same content. \n\nIngredients - Water, barley malt, non-malted cereals, hops\n\nGoes well with Mexican food, malty , fresh clean, \n\nGood beer",

Tiny bit of chocolate and bread crust in the aftertaste, almost redeems things...\n\nNot quite medium-bodied, reasonably low ABV, fairly high carbonation.\n\nSubstituting caramel malt, 6-row, 2-row, and rice for Munich malt, this isn't really a proper example of the style, but it is one of the better industrial lagers around.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Appearance: Clear amber, ok head but fades out quickly.\n\nSmell: Bit of sweetness, toffee.\n\nTaste: Mild sweetness, light fruit notes-fig and raisin. Light body, “ok”.\n\nOverall: I used to have Negra Modelo a fair amount in the small town I lived in after college as it was the “fancy” beer at the decent restaurant in town. Never reviewed it until now, it's decent, some decent fruit flavors but there are much tastier vienna lagers out there.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The look reminds me of a watered down stout, the smell reminds me of a less strongly stout, the taste is definitely a mix of a lager and a stout. It has a sweet watered down stout taste with the feel of you can drink a lot but it will get you off guard. Drink with precaution but this isn't a drink I'd pick up over guiness.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pretty good! Maybe even better than especial!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Seemed quite fizzy when pour but actually not that carbonated. Dark brown color, thin foam, didn't last long. On sweet side, feels of caramel like it's color. Not much else going on. Thin body. Not really bitter. It's just ok.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by February 2022.\n\nLooks okay. Clear deep reddish amber body. The initial foamy tan head doesnt last long, becoming a thin ring and covering. No lacing.\n\nFaint sweet lightly roasty malty aroma.\n\nOn tasting, it's on the sweet side. Does have that dunkel flavor, but very weak in the body.\n\nMouth between thin and medium, finish slightly dry and faintly roasty.\n\nOverall, kind of a dunkel-lite feel. No bad, just not much substance.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Friday, July 23, 2021\t6:03 PM\t\n12 ounce bottle poured to wine glass\nSight: Dark amber, small off white foam, appears clear\nSmell: very good, aroma of malt\nTaste: very good, Sweet, bold complex flavor, slightly bitter\nMouth feel: very good carbonation, no tartness, very good follow through, very good finish\nOverall: good beer, ok to repeat, not look for",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a light copper color with a small head. \n\nVery mild aromas of brown bread, cereal grains, and roasted nuts.\n\nFlavor is basically brown bread with some grape nuts. Maybe Raisin Bran. No hop presence. Not terrible. Inoffensive and drinkable.\n\nFeel is very watery with minimal carbonation. Bad batch? Definitely not right for the style. Beer is fresh, as dated on the bottle.\n\nOverall, this is a...drinkable beer, I guess. Not something I'd stick my nose up at if it was offered to me. Both bottles I had were like flat soda, so not sure what happened there. Otherwise, the flavors and aromas are inoffensive at worst.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Six pack from Food Express in Tobyahanna, freshness dated until 2-2022. I had one of these recently after not tasting one for about a decade, and I must say I'm very impressed... and not just by the gold foil! I figured I'd give it a proper review. 12 oz. bottle poured into standard pilsner glass.\n\nLook: Dark like a schwarzbier (my autocorrect keeps going to Schwarzenegger, which makes sense since this beer is a frickin' Action Hero). A solid cap of beige foam leaves behind very leggy lacing, clinging all over the place.\n\nSmell: Fresh rye bread and a little hint of something like coffee or dark chocolate, but not very strong. Also a surspisingly pleasant vegetal note mixed in there somewhere.\n\nTaste: Sweet but not too sweet. A little bit of hop bitterness up front, then rich chocolate malt coats the mid palate and finishes clean, with a little bit of hoppy skunk remaining akin to a Heineken. This aspect reminds me the most of regular Modelo (or &quot;Modelo Especial&quot; if you're nasty).\n\nFeel: So, so, SO smooth. If you're looking for a Mexican session beer that doesn't require a lime, THIS is your boy right here. This stuff just glides down your throat, it's like drinking a majestic swan.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best beers you can find almost anywhere, and by that I mean you can go to almost any store that sells beer and they'll carry this. There are better beers out there, but I'd gamble that none are as widely available or reasonably priced. In a word... Excellent."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a big, classic West Coast double IPA and it’s one of the best specimens of that species. Juicy, piney, and full bodied while achieving a dry finish. \n\nSmells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. Usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness, but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time I bet. I get sweet malty orange spicy hops. Wow. \n\nOn the tongue piney, orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. Finishes fairly dry despite the thick, wet feel it hits you with. \n\nIt’s big, it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.\n\nI loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it:\n\nBy: Tracy Hensley lJudges Rating: \n\nOverall Impression: \n18 / 20\n\nA consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin, pineapple syrup, freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. From 8 inches away, Tahitian vanilla bean pods, baked whole wheat bread, low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. The white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy, golden appearance. Flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread, which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate, throat-coating alcoholic warmth. The second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. Full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth, and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not sure how fresh this is, as it was on the discount shelf. Pours a clear amber honey with a thick white head that recedes to a thin cap and leaves great lacing. Aroma is orange rind and pine. Flavor is sweet citrusy fruits followed by a bitter pine with some caramel malts in the mix. Feel is a bit heavy but overall a very nice brew. I'd like to try this fresh and/or on tap.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev pours golden. The smell is citrusy and hops. The taste is how it smells. The feel is crisp and clean. Doesn't feel like 8%. Very refreshing beer.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured a deep gold leaning toward orange rather than amber. Aroma hits you with exactly what the name told you to expect. Hops hops and more hops.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. It has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. The finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. It really is a nice porter, but overall it's too light, could be so much more.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a dark coffee brown, ruby hues and a creamy tan head. Aromas are fairly muted, a roasted malt profile is there but I can’t really pick anything definitive. Flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee, raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. Trademark SN floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the palate.\n\nIt’s good for sure, not extraordinary or anything. As with any beer, freshness is everything.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Had this one in a blind taste test recently with 3 other porters and it just did not stack up. The look was different, the carbonation was different, the taste was bland in comparison. Not as good as I remembered.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Look: Dark brown, almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light, with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly, leaving good lacing\nAroma: Roasted barley, chocolate notes, toasted nuts, warm brown bread, and some earthiness\nTaste: Roast is the highlighted theme here. Tons of roasted barley, nuttiness, and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside, chocolate joins the mix. More roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish\nMouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes\nOverall: This is tasty stuff. I hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when I saw bottles dated 10/9/20, I had to revisit and glad I did. A very well-made American porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. Throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner. A classic and delicious to boot",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not a typical porter. Pours dark. Odd smell. A very mild clean body. Slight roasted malt finish. Smooth. The malt could be more pronounced. It's good but not typical for the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I consume my share of porters in the fall and winter and this one is pretty good, though it lacks greatness. One flaw is that it is a little thin mouthfeel for a porter. The taste is solid, but the roasted malt is not as prominent as it is in some other porters that I prefer. It's solid, but I can usually do better in the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours up beautifully dark with a thick two-finger tan collar. Nice balance between malt and hops--tastes similar to Sierra Nevada Stout--just slightly less hops coming through. Overall very good."

Good strength overall, complexity is only moderate. \n\nT: Dank tangerine-grapefruit flavor provides a bittering first bite with a flowery edge. Big grassy dry hopping soon moves in. A touch of soapy hopping is every so slight. Resiny with a flowery bite of hops that really packs a wallop. \n\nM: Resiny mouthful, with a follow of dry flowery lacing on the tongue. Very bitter on the hold. Small carbonation factor that really does not make nor break it either way. \n\nO: Overall 3 Floyds makes some trueley outstanding beers that stand above the rest, unfortunately this is a mere placeholder in terms of the brewery's other accords. While solid in strength with a demanding flowery hop bitterness, I just did not find it contained a lot of complexity or malt attributes. The blunt force of hops most likely drowned out any small and subtle secondary contributions.

SN-esque hop balance... citrus leather, malty orange, piney greenery... piney, orange-pithy ping persists...\n\nF: wafty waifish wispiness, despite the hefty heart-hearthy hedonic homey hum... mellow, pithy tang pinging out front of a ghostly pulse... I'm lost for words; put me to sleep\n\nO: this gave me multiple pauses... more mystery and interest and sedate sultry vibes compared to the Dreadnaught I finally had only within the last month... I may need to return to the undisclosed bunker in which I found this and negotiate some more, ooh baby... I'm not I recall the last time I met such a sipper (1741)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This was another beer that I picked up recently at the Whole Foods in Williamsburg. Always enjoyed 3 Floyds as it’s nice to see them available in this neck of the woods again! This was a clear winner as it had plenty going for it as it fit it's &quot;massive IPA&quot; description quite nicely, down to the last sip!\n\nThe look and feel to this was reminiscent of West Coast beers as it had a gorgeous copper hue to it with a fine haze and a bit of dark sediment floating around in it. Plenty of head topped it off as the lacing was deep, extensive, and beautifully layered all the way down the side of my pint glass. Loads of pine, resin, and grapefruit in the nose along with a bit of Caramel Malt as the taste nicely followed suit. Lots of floral notes that felt like Anchor emerged in the notes as this warmed up with a nice resinous body underneath that. The back had a ton of grapefruit and lemon zest to go along with some sweet malt that almost called for a chaser of water to finish this off, except I wanted the flavor to last as long as possible!\n\nThe carbonation was softly moderate and the body was balanced as the booze was not that noticeable. Loved the label on this can as this had a packaging dated of 12/28 on the bottom of the can. Aside from that being barely legible, this was a lovable beast of a beer that easily deserved another go-around. Who knew that one of the best left coast beers came out of Indiana?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 12/28/20\n\nAnd we're back with another imperial IPA from 3 Floyds. I loved their Permanent Funeral, and I'm hoping that this is in a similar vein. Regardless, I'm always on the lookout for new beers from them ever since they started distributing here in Mass. Let's dive right in\n\nPours a cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing\n\nOn first whiff, this is a promising beer. It's big and in your face while also being balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of rich caramel, bready malt, juicy orange, resiny hops, apricot, and a touch of honey\n\nThere's less of a delicate balance in the taste, but it's still good for what it is. On the front end of the sip the malt dominates and I'm tasting caramel, soft bread, lightly floral hops, and a touch of lemon zest. The swallow bitters up a bit, bringing notes of pithy grapefruit, orange marmalade, fresh pine, herbal hops, and light bready malt\n\nA medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a hint of warming alcohol\n\nThis was very good, but I've had much better from them. Still, I would get it again in a heartbeat if it was my only 3F choice",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev a: slightly murky dark copper color with a nice 3 finger frothy tan head\n\ns: mango and pineapple with loads of sweet caramel and strawberry upfront. kiwi, passionfruit, and peach. candied apricots and tangerine. crackers and a touch of honey. faint grapefruit and a little bit of grass\n\nt: sweet caramel and strawberries. pineapple and a lot of peach. peach cobbler, orange sorbet, and a nice piney bitterness. sweet melons and honeydew. grass and grapefruit towards the end. little bit of a bready malt backbone. nice hit of bitterness at the very end\n\nm: full mouthfeel, slightly sticky. low-medium carbonation\n\no: a bit mellow in the flavor with a big hit of bitterness. malts are definitely noticeable, but the bitterness overrides. hops aren't too diversified, but this is a old school DIPA for sure, with more bitterness than i would have thought for a DIPA. Good, not great IMO",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a hazy golden tangerine with two big fingers of head and a plethora of floaties. The nose has pine and earthy notes. The flavor is pithy with a touch of citrus that is present but way in the back. The finish starts off bitter and gets more so as one moves down the glass. \n\nIf you like candied IPAs, this ain't the beer for you!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev helluva beer, man, helluva beer. it's a hop monster - if that's not your style, you've been warned. If that *is* your style, you've been warned. \nL: from the can. The can is, as it proclaims, &quot;not normal&quot;.\nS: basically all pine. mine might be a bit too cold. i'll note if more emerges as it warms.\nT: big grapefruit hop bomb with a few floral notes. Not for the faint of heart. 3F goes big, not home.\nF: smooth, rich, drying, and more bitter!\nO: hey, it works for me, what can i say!?",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Beautiful deep amber with a tall, rocky, pale doeskin head with everlasting gobstopper like retention. Rim to liquid lace drapes the glass, the nearly red-amber beer is opaque with protein haze but not flocked with suspended oat starch.\nThe aroma is malt - rich and sweet followed quickly by sugar dusted tangerines and honey dipped pine cones. Yummy jam on toast smells welcome the nose and entice it in for deeper snuffs. The hops could be louder but then the lovely malt would be lost. 3F's knows what they're doing. \nThe taste is again malt up front with a rush of hop flavors and bitterness on it's heals. More honey notes coat the tongue and help soften the barrage of hop flavors and bitter bite. Fruity flavors of pear and grapefruit mix with the spruce and pine needles and green grass notes all smothered in that honey - caramel malt sweetness in balanced complexity achieved by only the best of brewers. \nThe malt liquor aspect comes through at the finish which is dry and warming with a nice lingering alcohol and hop aftertaste. The priming sugar addition detracts from the overall mouth feel maybe and only offers tasteless alcohol to the mix. \nThe body is shy of full and the alcohol hides as I said , till the very end. A bit over dry on the back end.\nHighly drinkable, superbly balanced at least up front and, in the end, extremely satisfying.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Canned 5 weeks ago.\n\nL -- Slightly hazy copper body in the glass with two fingers of rocky off-white head produced with moderate pour. Decent retention and minimal lacing\nS -- Dried pine, woodsy earthiness, booze, caramel, herbal bitters, hint of copper\nT -- Big time old-school hop smack. Lots of earthy, pithy, rindy hop character and a decent honey-sweet 2-row malt backbone to the hop onslaught\nF -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium carb. Long, lasting, resinous bitterness on the finish\nO -- Not really my style of IPA, but this is certainly a solid example of a west coast bruiser\n\n72/100",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Good old school west coast double IPA",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/28/20, so 5-6 weeks old.\n\nActual hazy burnt orange/marmalade colored body. Small bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering, leaving interesting lacing.\n\nLightly hoppy aroma.\n\nOn tasting, pretty aggressive beer. The malt sweetness is detectable, but merely serves as a platform for an all out (panzer) assault of bitter grapefruit and pine hops.\n\nMouth closer to full than medium, finish a slightly sweet strong grapefruit hit to the palate.\n\nOverall, after an initial shock, this one really grew on me. Excellent old style DIPA. Happy to have another 3 in the fridge.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev L: golden hue, somewhat hazy.\nS: piney and stone fruit.\nT: peach flows throughout the swallow.\nF: soft with a hop bite.\nO: as balanced as an imperial ipa can get with massive hop additions.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Can purchased at One Stop Beer Shop in Greece, NY.\n\nThis one pours a light amber/dark orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.\n\nThis smells supremely resinous, with stone fruit, orange peel, piney hops, with an almost burnt aroma.\n\nI've been wanting to try this one since basically 2014, and it's finally available to me locally. It's an uncompromising old school bruiser. The taste is placed firmly back into the IBU wars of yesteryear, with a bit piney/grassy/pithy biterness, with bitter grapefruit, orange peel, and some slightly compromising stone fruit/orange sweetness. A lot of people wouldn't like this in today's juice bomb day and age. To me, it's a really great look back in time, and it still holds up for me today.\n\nThis is a slow sipper due to the intense pithy bitterness here. As it warms, bitterness retreats slightly, with a bit more fruity hop character. There is nothing &quot;juicy&quot; about this one.\n\nI was excited to hear this was one in town on shelves, and it's met my expectations from back in my old money days. This was a great West Coast style IPA.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev If I could give it a zero i would. By far the worst beer I have ever tasted. Says it’s a pale ale. It’s so bitter like a ipa"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev After trying a lot of session IPAs, I basically ended up avoiding the style save for Founder's All-Day. Well, this bottle of beer, which I consumed on the porch during the pandemic, reminds me a lot of All-Day. It has a soft hop bitterness. Many sessions are almost overly hopped and quite thin without the malt backbone.",

Like freshly turned soil.\nT: Wood and resin.\nF: Bitter and astringent, as it’s supposed to be.\nO: A full-on west coast IPA at only 4.7%.

Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer.

Drinkable, yes, also refreshing and tasty, too. It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I was given this can by my cousin as a gift but since I have such a backlog here, it took me a while to get around to this. Canned on 10/26/17 with enjoy by date of 1/24/18 printed below it, I did not have this fresh but did keep it cold until I cracked it open today. It's been a while since I've had anything from Stone and although their IPA's were a big reason why I love that style so much now, this one was just a bit underwhelming to me...\n\nThe pour was decent as the liquid was golden, fairly translucent, and topped off with plenty of head. Only a few scattered sections of lacing were left behind once I took my first few sips. Tons of floral notes, citrus pith, dry lime, and smooth hops could be found in the nose but the overall appeal was that of a dry and earthy beer. That's exactly what this turned out to be once I sipped this as it felt much stronger than a session IPA and I needed a chaser of water to fully get this down. Some prickly pear cactus and pine emerged as this warmed up but the basic malt presence and grassy aftertaste weren't enough to put this over the top.\n\nRegardless of the flavor profile, the lack of discernible alcohol made this somewhat easy to quaff and the slightly resinous aftertaste was a pleasant reminder that this was indeed an IPA and not a Pale Ale. Not really feeling this one but because of the age, it's hard to tell whether that was because of my inaction in getting around to this or the beer itself. If you're looking for a &quot;light' version of their flagship IPA, reach for this and please, consume it fresh!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The Go To IPA pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a big 1 finger rocky and soapy looking head that fades rather slowly. The smell is dank and hop forward from the Cascade hops, with hints of stone fruit, citrus and a lemon zest with grapefruit and floral notes, along with a bit of malt sweetness. Let’s see how it goes down…rather smooth across the palette with a medium mouthfeel. You get a nice dose of pithy citrus up front with some tropical fruits with a good pine bite. The sweet malt follows with a bit of prickly carbonation. As it finishes quite dry."

Once you get past the initial punch of chocolate there are notes of vanilla and roasted malt\n\nThe taste follows the nose quite closely. The milk chocolate is complimented with some notes of roasted malt. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and vanilla. Medium/full bodied and velvety smooth.

About a inch of foam risen to the surface.\nSmell: Getting a strong metallic smell as if I opened a guiness. Maybe it's the way the Irish brew their beers? Noticed this on quite a few irish stouts before. Especially Guinness. Got hints of metallic, chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end. \nTaste: Wow!!!! Got huge notes of chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end. Initial contact was chocolate and the end flavor was the cocoa.

Lacing is wonderful, and the head retention is fantastic.\nS - Milk chocolate, caramel, and rich malts. Generic wheat backing everything, but damn - that chocolate!\nT - Chocolate, molasses, and wheat are the stars here. It starts out as a sort of semisweet cocoa, then slowly transforms into a sweet milk chocolate. The taste is akin to those &quot;Chocolonely&quot; bars you sometimes see in stores. There's a slight ethanol flavor at the VERY end (like the last two sips). The finish is walnut and toffee, with an extremely faint floral note.\nF - Silky, creamy, and rich. Incredibly easy-to-drink, but not filling in the slightest. Full-bodied, with medium-light carbonation.\nO - An incredible brew, and one of my favorites of all time. Sam Smith aimed to make a chocolate beer, and a chocolate beer they did make! This beer feels inviting. The sort of inviting that feels like when your old hippie friend from the mountains of Western North Carolina shared a six-pack after helping him make tie-dye shirts. It's a certain feeling that is always weird to describe, but it evokes nostalgia and warmth for what probably happened a week ago. The chocolate notes in this beer are the stars here, and they nailed it. One would likely argue that this is a dessert beer, but I could see myself enjoying a pint of this stuff alongside a roasted duck and some mashed potatoes. It tastes heavy, but feels pretty light - sort of like a Guinness. I cannot recommend this brew enough. Even if it seems expensive (it is), it's worth every penny. Buy it if you see it. I know I will.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing amount of flavor packed into a 5% abv stout. Sweet chocolate aroma and taste. Not thick or sticky like many higher abv sweet stouts, but still creamy with a pleasant mouthfeel. Very nice lacing.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Lovely dark brown colour, almost black, with garnet red highlights. Foamy tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves thick lacing that sticks around for the whole pint. The chocolate on the nose goes without saying, but there is also toffee, vanilla, and a hint of something that reminds me of red wine tannins, reminiscent of Sam Smith's nut brown ale. Of course the taste is mostly semisweet baker's chocolate, with some toasty toffee malt, vanilla, and a bit of drying bitterness, though the beer is quite sweet. As other reviews have noted, the feel is not quite as full bodied as most stouts, but it is nicely rounded and smooth. Overall a novel and very enjoyable ale, though I imagine a session on it would have your gut protesting."

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Translucent beer with an unfiltered look. Light head without much lacing. Smell nicely previews the yeastiness that comes about in the front and back of the beer. Taste is smooth and interesting, as the full malty flavor of the ale comes in the front and stays in the back of the mouth throughout. It's a bit overcarbonated for my taste, but that might be a function of me being less familiar with Belgian style ales. Overall a decent beer you should pick up if it's in front of you.",

The beer pours hefe-hazy in light orange &amp; yellow color with off white head. The head maintains at a steady quarter inch fed by a ton of bubbles from the bottom of this North Coast tulip. The aroma is soft pale malt accented by fruity and floral notes. The taste is semisweet malt and candi sugar with hints of banana, clove, pear and white pepper. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Separating a 4-pack of 12oz bottles. North Coast Brewing's Old Rasputin is one of my all time favorite beers. I am excited to mull this over.\nPours a vibrant copper-orange, SRM 8. with an active, mousse-like off-white head, thin. Bubbles are small and fast to rise. There is a bit of cloudiness, but it is still clear. On the nose I get ripened banana and honey grain. Coriander with clove? A blanketing bouquet of flowers. All the notes are rather humble but synergize complexly. It tastes zingy upfront, but very rapidly mellows into sweeter baked goods. Banana again. It almost tastes like a shocktop with added dimension. I swear there are micronotes of coriander and orange peel. Hop bitterness (Saaz) short-lived next to the slurry of malt and corn. It has a body to it, and medium-high carbonation. Oily yet soft.\nI am thoroughly impressed with this Belgian Golden Ale. All reminiscent of Belgian styles, softer, sweet bread, subtle ester combinations. It is fruitier, with less caramel, compared to say, a tripel. And not as hefty. Let us not be deceived by the 7.6ABV, I wouldn't have guessed blindfolded, it is much smoother. A yeasty, golden bouquet to satisfy any palate.",

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a clear reddish-brown color with little head. Scent is of citrus and hops, with the taste surprisingly bitter. Light-medium mouthfeel and an aftertaste dominated by bitter hops",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev The appearance has a golden amber/maybe closer to a yellow colored body, one finger white foamy head that dissipates and leaves a nice spider web speckled faded looking lacing, light carbonation is seen rising. The smell is slightly sour and/or tart mango/lemon fruitiness up front, hops showing some pizazz. The taste is basically the same adding a bitterness from the hops that seem to be showing a bit more, lemony aftertaste, quick dry finish. The palate sits light on the body, pretty sessionable (perhaps poundable to some). Carbonation is somewhat sharp which is good for the style and I say good to me. Overall, I say this is a good Belgian IPA by style that I would have again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Not at all what I expected, completely blew my mind. Belgian yeast at the front in the aroma and taste, nice silky body with small soapy head. Nice sharp yeasty finish.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Very pretty color, orange, full on 5/6&quot; of white head. Carbonation tight, aroma was interesting, lots of hops hitting those tropical fruit strides. Belgian yeast. This is what I imagine a first tier Belgian ipa to be like in this day and age. Give me some yeasty and hoppy competition.\n\nTaste is both of those with a very dry and welcome finish. Hides the strength so well. A fun beer, doesn't seem to be as plentiful since its first year, but always a welcome addition, I dig it.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint 6 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 8.85%, 1.082 OG and 72.51 IBU. It also note that it was fermented with the Westmalle yeast strain. \n\nAppearance: The body has a deep amber color with a thick cloudy yeast haze. It’s topped off with a quick setting head of off white foam. Only a light thin film covering remains after a minute. Lacing is minimal and slick. \n\nSmell: The aroma has sweet bready maltiness with notes of honey and then loads of pineapple, apple peel, orange peel and some pine like hops. \n\nTaste / Palate: The flavor is full of sweet honey notes inside of a deep bready and yeast like base with waves of different fruity notes. My bottle is fairly well aged so hop bitterness is much lower than a fresh bottle. It also worth noting that the 8.85abv is not noticeable at all. The palate and feel are fairly full and smooth. Carbonation is low."

Taste is strictly that Cascade Hops taste, not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel. Nice carbonation! Not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like I've experienced with some beers (Rebel Rouser, Ranger IPA, Torpedo).

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Liberty Ale is a crisp, solid, toasted session IPA classic that has really stood out over the years. Liberty Ale is clean, medium-bodied, well-filtered &amp; to this day one of my favorite daily drinkers. My refrigerator almost always has a six pack of Liberty Ale in it.\n\nI really enjoy the hop profile of this beer. To me, Liberty Ale is the epitome of a West Coast IPA. I live in the Northeast and we have an absolutely horrendous assortment of Anchor beer on the shelves at most grocery stores such as Wegmans or ShopRite. Unfortunately, Anchor's sales reps just don't get the job done here in New England. \n\nEvery time I'm out in San Francisco I make sure to imbibe on all of the wonderful bruise that we miss out on from Anchor, here in the Northeast.",

Very mild sweet malt at the back that's hard to detect.\n\nMouthfeel: Slightly thin, with very high carbonation.\n\nOverall: This definitely feels like one of America's first post-Prohibition forays into the IPA.

Very refreshing.\nO - I've had this beer before on multiple occasions, and I'm happy to review it for the first time [officially]! It's a refreshing brew for certain, with a vague berry aroma and a wheat-filled aroma. Unfortunately, the raspberry flavor doesn't exactly come out as advertised. In a beer where they make it the main attraction, that's not really a great thing.

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This is a great beer and completely underrated on BA. There is a fruity, berry essence that permeates a sweet, malty backbone, with a slight finish of resiny hops.

They missed the mark with the raspberry flavor though.",

Slightly sweet, medium caramelized malt aroma, with a touch of sweet spice and a tiny noble hop note. Very smooth, touch sweet, lightly spiced, moderately roasted and caramelized malt, with a very subtle, floral, noble hop aspect. Medium, creamy mouthfeel, and a caramelized malt and touch of hops, for the finish. Really good!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev This beer brings a unique character to the style. It pours and smells similar to a pilsner. The body is complex, sweet and malty with a delicate finish. A definite regular drinker for lager fans",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12oz bottle enjoy by 11/7/21 into a tall lager glass.\nL: Pours pure rich gold with a 1&quot; fluffy, bubbly eggshell white head that goes to thin. Low carbonation with some free-form lacing.\nS: Sweet rich caramel, faint malt, esters, white bread, yeast.\nT: Sweet rich dark caramel, butterscotch candy, light pine, orange zest, peach, orange cognac, caramelized toasted malts. Fruity hops weave through semi-chewy malt.\nF: Extra smooth semi-randy med-heavy mouthfeel with a clean, high-gloss medium length finish. It is lightly drying.\nO: Light bitterness stays on top of the broad malt wave to complete a very full flavored clean drinking and overall semi-sweet American Dortmund Gold Lager. Rich and smooth it is very excellent in it's style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Amazing classic Lager that has it all. It's been around since Great Lakes opened its doors and remains a top contender in this category.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Pours a &quot;beery&quot; looking yellow with a white head that fades quickly leaving a lightly laced glass. Malty aroma with some mild hops, flavor follows with some &quot;bready&quot; notes. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied. I didn't think I'd care much for this one. I was wrong.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Flavorful and refreshing, a long-time favorite summer beer for me. A year round fav, actually. Clear golden color, low to moderate carbonation, nice head dissolves pretty quickly, pleasing lacing, not too much. Moderately alchoholic, high fives. All in all, a superb, restrained brew, that doesn't cry out for attention. But you realize that it deserves attention: perfect balance of malt and hops, (for a lager, that is). To me, the equal of some of the most enjoyable lagers I've had in Germany.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev I tended to avoid this because I thought the style was boring compared to others but sometimes you learn to appreciate a well crafted beer of any style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From the bottle, it pours a golden color with a modest white head that slowly reduces to a thin layer and nice ring. The nose gets malt with some caramel notes. The mouth gets the same: nicely malty overall.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev 12 oz can, best-by date of 09/08/21 stamped on the bottom, poured into a pilsner glass.\n\nA: Pours a clear deep golden color with a fluffy one-and-a-half finger white head. Steady stream of bubbles rising from the bottom.\n\nS: Toasted malt, some mild floral hops, and just a hint of spice.\n\nT: Freshly baked rye bread, toasted malt, a hint of honey and cinnamon spice. Dry hop bitterness is mild and perfectly complements the malt sweetness.\n\nM: Medium bodied, smooth, just the right amount of carbonation.\n\nO: The canonical example of a balanced, easy-drinking lager that can be full of flavor and immensely enjoyable.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev One of the best beers around.!"

            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Drinking this at home.\nPoured from a can into a pint glass.\nLooks dark brown almost black with a nice foamy tannish head.\nSmells malty, sweet, chocolate, coffee.\nMouth feel is medium for the style.\nOverall a nice stout that I would definitely drink again.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev RBESG 2006 Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Very nice roasty and hoppy aroma, some sweetish bakery notes in the background. Nice roasty flavour, not overdone, notes of good coffee, hints of dark chocolate. A very good stout in my book.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev On tap at Rogue in Newport. The color is opaque black, with a nitro head and huge frothy bubbles that are retained on a solid crown. The smell is super oaty, sweet, mollasses, cream, and dark rich malt, not much toast. The taste betrays the smell with licorice and rich oats up front, shifting into sarsparilla and rich toasted malt, finishing on a lingering hop notes and mollasses sweetness. Finish wise this is a dry stout for me, and the mouthfeel is thin for a typical stout and finishes moderately dry, which i find interesting.\n\nThis is a great oatmeal stout that stands out different from others that rely on heavy cloying sweetness so often. Great job!",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev A- This one pours a very dark brown color and is fairly hard to see through, but some light does pass. The head is rich and creamy, about two fingers in thickness initially and settles fast into a thick layer of foam above the brew itself. Carbonation appears to be about average for the style, while the lacing is tan colored, with very little in terms of cling around the inside of the glass. Decent looking overall\n\nS- Lots of cocoa initially, which gives way to a slightly soapy tang. Underlying notes of black coffee, grassy/grainy oat flake, dark fruit remnants, dark chocolate nougat malt sweetness, and dare I say a piney quality that reminds me of the outdoors....interesting!\n\nT- There is some citrus peel zest, piney resin and overall this isn't good for the style. Unfortunately, it overtakes the chocolate/coffee/char that I was hoping for. As for the more traditional flavors, they are there, but are all over the place, and are more noted on the finish than rather in the middle of the taste. There is a weird lingering aftertaste that is more of hops than anything. The oat dryness is present and I think this is enhancing what I am not liking about the flavors here, which is unfortunate, as I normally like a good Oatmeal Stout.\n\nM/O- Medium bodied and the carbonation is fairly robust too, providing more of a pale ale vibe than anything. Drinkability is poor for this reason and overall this falls short in what I was expecting this to be. Rogue is generally a favored brewery with its offerings in my opinion, but this is about as interesting and enjoyable as a Shakespearean play. Not good.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev Poured from a bottle into a stout glass.\n\nPours a very dark-brown (nearly black) opaque with a creamy dark tan head that lingers for the last finger, giving way to exceptional foam and lacing.\n\nAromas of bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roasted malts, and dark fruits. \n\nThe brew hits the tip of the tongue with bittersweet chocolate and hints of coffee and roasted grain. And then---the main event arrives in midstream. BIg oat flavor rises above the din, with the grainy oats blending with some subtle but solid dark fruit flavor. Deceptively hidden grassy and earthy hops augment the coffee and chocolate bitterness and bring it all home.\n\nThe brew is just shy of full-bodied, with the grainy oats providing a drying finish. Very drinkable for the style.\n\nExceptional representation of the style.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle. \n\nPitch black, no light passes. \n\nNice khaki head which dissipates but doesn't disappear. \n\nStrong lacing. \n\nMild cocoa nose. \n\nMedium thick mouthfeel. \n\nOats kick in with the taste; hops are clearly present as well. \n\nA lot going on here; the oats &amp; hops mixing creates an odd metallic effect on my tongue. For all that it's really drinkable and certainly unique.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev If you like dry oatmeal stouts, you'll like this one. Rogue makes good stuff, but I expected just a bit more here. It's very oatmeal-heavy, with just a bit of creaminess but not as much as I'd have thought, and a bit of smokiness as well. Yes, it's very dry.",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev (12 oz bottle, 19559... poured into a nonic)\n\nL: relatively high-rise dark tan foam stand on pour; collapses slow, holding a tight, creamy construct; dark brown liquid, reddish highlights... chunky collar and dark tone to foam remains; a few nice wide bands of lace\n\nS: dark chocolate milk, chocolate cake; subtle toasty-roasty and char notes; earthy, woodsy/piney background hop essence... shows a lil old leather as it goes\n\nT: smooth roasted barley wash up front, cakey malt middle, hint of dark coffee in the finish; big robust piney bitter afterburn humming with the charred roast in the aftertaste; back end is relatively dry - majority of sugars express burnt caramelization... roast and bitter last a long time; delicate toffee-ish sweetness builds\n\nF: the bitterness, roast, and ample carbonation fray the ends, balancing out the husky milkiness of its body... alcohol plays real light... feels like a meal unto itself; soft oily, resinous residual film\n\nO: takes me back!... this used to be a regular (bomber-size) swill of mine back in the early aughts - moved on to other breweries, styles... don't see this too often anymore; happened to find this at State Line, thought I'd take a trip down fuzzy-memory lane (1403)",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev From Labirratorium. In Teku glass. Playing Khimera. Dry and bitter,with soft roastyness and some chocolate and coffee notes.Nice but I expected more smooth and creamy body and stronger flavors"
